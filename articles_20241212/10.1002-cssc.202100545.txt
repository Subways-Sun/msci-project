Low‐density carbon‐derivatives, including graphene oxides, reduced graphene oxides, and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), as well as their combinations with porous organic materials, such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs), have been proposed as light and flexible materials for use in energy‐storage systems.<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0012 #cssc202100545-bib-0013 #cssc202100545-bib-0014 #cssc202100545-bib-0015"><sup>[12–15]</sup></link> COFs have gained attention as an emerging class of battery electrode materials because their frameworks can form conjugated networks in two‐dimensional (2D) directions with ordered mesoporous arrays, and electrons can be delocalized through the frameworks.<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0016 #cssc202100545-bib-0017 #cssc202100545-bib-0018 #cssc202100545-bib-0019 #cssc202100545-bib-0020 #cssc202100545-bib-0021 #cssc202100545-bib-0022"><sup>[16–22]</sup></link> Furthermore, in the conventional COFs, the 2D frameworks can be stacked to form 3D structures in an eclipse arrangement via supramolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding and π‐π interactions. Additionally, the 3D structures have mesoporous 2D channels, which can facilitate ion mobility. However, the introduction of linkers into the frameworks, which is necessary for the 3D structure, can break the π conjugation, giving rise to poor electrical conductivity.<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0022"><sup>[22]</sup></link> Moreover, COFs exhibit low colloidal stability in solutions due to their strong tendency to form 3D supramolecular structures.</p><p>Previously, we dedicated our research efforts to developing a new type of network polymer called covalent organic nanosheets (CONs), as a potential anode material for SIBs. The material was designed to overcome the drawbacks of COFs regarding conductivity.<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0021 #cssc202100545-bib-0022"><sup>[21,22]</sup></link> CONs are similar to exfoliated nanosheets of 3D COFs, except that they do not contain linkers that can form hydrogen bonds. The absence of linkers enables CONs to not only be fully conjugated but to also prevent 3D stacking, resulting in better electrical conductivity and higher colloidal stability than those of COFs. Since CONs do not conventionally form 3D stacks of sheets, they hardly form ordered mesoporous 2D channel arrays in solid states. However, we demonstrated that CONs with relatively high conductivity can perform better as anodes of SIBs than similarly structured CONs with relatively high porosity and/or surface area. Further, as shown in our previous paper, it was found that CONs can improve the SIB performance by controlling their band gap to improve the electrical conductivity.<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0018"><sup>[18]</sup></link> Thus, we propose that the material conductivity is also one of the important factors influencing the performance of SIBs, although the surface‐area control is also essential.</p><p>In this contribution, to provide insights and breakthroughs for the material design for SIBs, we suggested an alternative simple method to enhance the electrical conductivity of electrode materials via the hybridization of organic/inorganic 2D materials. We selected graphene nanosheets (GNs) as a starting material for the hybridization with CONs since GNs, which has a very high electrical conductivity, can enhance the electrochemical Na‐ion storage property. As suggested in Scheme <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-5001">1</link>a, CON polymerization was conducted in the presence of GNs via a layer‐by‐layer method. To form a type of network polymer, two monomers, 2,4,6‐tris(5‐bromothiophen‐2‐yl)‐1,3,5‐triazine (M1) and 2,5‐bis(trimethylstannyl)thieno‐(3,2‐b)thiophene (M2), were polymerized via the Stille cross‐coupling reaction over Pd<sup>0</sup> catalysts. To optimize the hybridization method, CON formation in the presence of GNs was performed via two different routes: reflux and solvothermal methods, as demonstrated in previous works.<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0021 #cssc202100545-bib-0022"><sup>[21,22]</sup></link> Further, we examined the electrochemical Na‐ion storage property of the hybrids: CON‐G‐10 and CON‐G‐16, synthesized by the reflux and solvothermal methods, respectively. The structural and compositional factors were systematically investigated by comparing the hybrids with the bare CONs. Both CON‐10 and 16 were prepared following previously reported procedures, as shown in Scheme <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-5001">1</link>b.<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0020"><sup>[20]</sup></link></p><figure xml:id="cssc202100545-fig-5001"><label>1</label><title type="figureName">Scheme</title><mediaResourceGroup><mediaResource alt="image" href="urn:x-wiley:18645631:media:cssc202100545:cssc202100545-fig-5001"/><mediaResource alt="magnified image" rendition="webHiRes" mimeType="image/png" href="graphic/cssc202100545-fig-5001-m.png"/></mediaResourceGroup><caption><p>Illustration of the general synthesis methods and unit structure of CONs (CON‐10 and 16) and the hybrids (CON‐G‐10 and CON‐G‐16).

As expected, the characteristic peaks of all the CONs, hybrids, and GNs were observed in the aromatic carbon region; no specific peaks were observed in the aliphatic carbon region, except spinning side bands, which correspond to the peaks in the aromatic region. Furthermore, the NMR spectrum of the GNs well demonstrates a broad sp<sup>2</sup> carbon peak at around 120 ppm with negligible signals derived from oxidized carbon, corresponding to pure graphite.<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0024 #cssc202100545-bib-0025 #cssc202100545-bib-0026 #cssc202100545-bib-0027"><sup>[24–27]</sup></link> The results implied that no significant chemical deterioration of the aromatic backbones occurs during the synthesis process.

However, all the peaks of the hybrids (CON‐G‐10 and CON‐G‐16) were broader than those of the bare CONs. The broadening of the “f” peak at around 115 ppm for the hybrids was even more severe, tailing up to approximately 100 ppm. The characteristic peaks derived from the two components in the hybrids can overlap, due to broadening and tailing; thus, it can be suggested that the two components (CONs and GNs) were hybridized in their solid states. In addition, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out to elucidate thermal behavior of CONs and hybrids. According to the TGA results, both CON‐G‐10 and CON‐G‐16 showed higher degradation temperature in comparison with those of the bare CONs, implying that the addition of GNs into the matrices of CONs could reinforce thermal stability (Figure S1, see Supporting Information). Tyndall tests of CONs and hybrids in very dilute concentration of 0.01 g L<sup>−1</sup> showed that clear laser‐light pathway can be observed under sunlight and dark condition, clarifying an excellent colloidal stability of samples.</p><figure xml:id="cssc202100545-fig-0001"><label>1</label><title type="figureName">Figure</title><mediaResourceGroup><mediaResource alt="image" href="urn:x-wiley:18645631:media:cssc202100545:cssc202100545-fig-0001"/><mediaResource alt="magnified image" rendition="webHiRes" mimeType="image/png" href="graphic/cssc202100545-fig-0001-m.png"/></mediaResourceGroup><caption><p>(a) <sup>13</sup>C solid‐state CP/MAS NMR spectra of all materials; (b) unit and repeating structures of CONs, denoting the specific chemical shifts in the NMR and the wavenumbers in the IR spectra; and (c) FTIR spectra of all materials in transmittance mode, indicating the C=N stretching frequency in <i>s</i>‐triazine (cyan blue) and the out‐of‐plane vibration frequency of C<sub>β</sub>−H in the thiophene units (magenta).</p></caption></figure><p>The Fourier‐transform infrared (FTIR) profiles of all the CONs, hybrids, and GNs were evaluated and compared to confirm the presence of functional groups, as shown in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0001">1</link>c (the specific vibrational frequencies are also denoted in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0001">1</link>b by matching colors with the dotted‐line colors in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0001">1</link>c). First of all, the FTIR spectrum of the GNs clearly shows an aromatic C=C vibration mode at approximately 1550 cm<sup>−1</sup> (gray dotted line in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0001">1</link>c), without a significant presence of oxygen‐containing functional groups.<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0028 #cssc202100545-bib-0029 #cssc202100545-bib-0030 #cssc202100545-bib-0031"><sup>[28–31]</sup></link> Conversely, the C=N vibrational mode in <i>s</i>‐triazine was detected at approximately 1498 cm<sup>−1</sup> for all the CONs and their hybrids. In general, the C=N vibrational frequency of <i>s</i>‐triazine in graphitic carbon nitride materials appears at around 1600 cm<sup>−1</sup>. Based on the literature, the C=N group of <i>s</i>‐triazine conjugated with thiophene is typically red‐shifted relative to graphitic carbon nitrides.<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0032 #cssc202100545-bib-0033 #cssc202100545-bib-0034"><sup>[32–34]</sup></link> The red‐shifted C=N bond suggested the existence of secondary bonds between nitrogen and sulfur, characterized as N−S intermolecular interactions in polythiazyl (Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0001">1</link>b). Such interactions are favorable for the formation of a planar conformation that locks the triazine rings and adjacent thiophene rings, thereby influencing the planarity of the entire framework, as predicted by density functional theory (DFT) calculation (Figure S2, see Supporting Information). Due to this red‐shift of the C=N vibration in this specific case, all the CONs and their hybrids clearly showed <i>s</i>‐triazine motifs without the peak overlapping with the C=C vibration peak for GNs. Furthermore, the FTIR spectra of all the CONs and their hybrids represented the C<sub>β</sub>−H out‐of‐plane vibrational mode at around 802–788 cm<sup>−1</sup>.<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0035 #cssc202100545-bib-0036"><sup>[35,36]</sup></link> In particular, the C=C bonds of the pristine GNs were still discernible in FTIR spectra of the hybrids, showing that the double bonds of both GNs and CONs were preserved in the hybrids. In addition, the X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) profiles were investigated in 1 s orbitals of C and N together with 2p orbital of S to confirm all the characteristic chemical bonds as shown in Figure S3 (see Supporting Information). Therefore, notably, CONs were successfully synthesized in the presence of GNs and hybridized without any decomposition of the chemical structure of each framework.</p><p>The electronic structures of CONs upon hybridization with GNs were investigated by analyzing their solid‐state ultraviolet/visible (UV/Vis) absorption, as shown in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0002">2</link>a with adsorption coefficients converted by Kubelka‐Munk equation. The absorption onsets of the bare CONs and the hybrids were almost identical, implying that the hybridization of CONs with GNS under reflux and solvothermal conditions did not alter the polymerization mechanism of the CONs. Furthermore, the bandgaps of all materials determined through Tauc plots with the absorption coefficients obtained from the Kulbelka‐Monk method were 2.03 eV for two types of CONs and 2.00 eV for two types of hybrid (Figure S4, see Supporting Information). However, the absorbance of CON‐G‐10 at approximately 450–680 nm was slightly lower than that of CON‐10, as indicated by the arrow in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0002">2</link>a. This phenomenon revealed that the primary CONs under the reflux condition could more favorably distribute in between the matrices of the GNs, leading to the effective suppression of the π‐π* electron transitions between the CON sheets.<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0037 #cssc202100545-bib-0038 #cssc202100545-bib-0039 #cssc202100545-bib-0040"><sup>[37–40]</sup></link> Previous studies have shown that the reflux reaction of CON‐G‐10 is suitable for fabricating planar network morphologies of CONs. Therefore, the polymerization of CON‐10 could be templated onto GNs utilizing Van der Waals interaction, resulting in well‐overlapped stacks of primary nanosheets of CON‐10 on GNs along the crystallographic <i>c</i>‐axis (Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0002">2</link>c). In contrast, the absorption profiles of CON‐G‐16 did not display such a hypochromic effect in the range of 450–680 nm; this is attributed to the morphological difference between CON‐10 and CON‐16. The net‐like morphology of CON‐16 that will be mentioned in the discussion on electron microscopic images reduces its effective contact area with GNs, decreasing the interaction between the constituting primary nanosheets in CON‐G‐16 (Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0002">2</link>d). Conversely, the higher absorption of the two types of hybrids than that of CONs, ranging over 700 nm, implied the existence of GN phases, as suggested in the literatures.<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0041 #cssc202100545-bib-0042"><sup>[41,42]</sup></link></p><figure xml:id="cssc202100545-fig-0002"><label>2</label><title type="figureName">Figure</title><mediaResourceGroup><mediaResource alt="image" href="urn:x-wiley:18645631:media:cssc202100545:cssc202100545-fig-0002"/><mediaResource alt="magnified image" rendition="webHiRes" mimeType="image/png" href="graphic/cssc202100545-fig-0002-m.png"/></mediaResourceGroup><caption><p>(a) Normalized UV/Vis adsorption profiles in the solid sates of the CONs and their hybrids; (b) PXRD of all materials corresponding to each UV/Vis profile with the reduced graphene oxide profile as a reference; (c, d) scheme of the hybrids in their solid sates according to their synthetic methods.

According to the EA results, the content of CON and GNs in the CON‐G‐10 were 76.6 wt % and 23.4 wt %, respectively, while the content of CON and GNs in the CON‐G‐16 were 63.7 wt % and 36.3 wt % in the final product, respectively. Therefore, it was found that the amount of CON framework in CON‐G‐10 was greater than CON‐G‐16 as the plate‐like morphology of CON‐10 was well overlapped with 2D morphology of GN resulting in strong van der Waal interaction. However, as CON‐16 favorably formed some segregated phase in CON‐G‐16 as aforementioned, the intermolecular interaction between CON‐16 and GN could be weaker than that between CON‐10 and GNs. As a result, in the purifying process such as Soxhlet extraction, CON‐16 might be extracted out from the hybrids leading to the smaller contents of CON in CON‐G‐16.</p><p>To probe the structural characteristics of the samples, powder X‐ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were analyzed with respect to all the CONs, pristine GNs, and hybrids (Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0002">2</link>b). First, the (002) diffraction of GNS was evidenced by the well‐developed PXRD peak at around 2<i>θ</i>=26°, with overlapping reflections of (100) and (101) in the range of 2<i>θ</i>=42–44° (Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0002">2</link>b, black line), which is in good agreement with that of graphite (JCPDS no. 04‐0221).<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0043 #cssc202100545-bib-0044 #cssc202100545-bib-0045"><sup>[43–45]</sup></link> The significantly broad PXRD peaks of GNs can be ascribed to the nanosized nature of GNs: the crystalline domain size of GNs was determined to be approximately 21.3 nm using the Scherrer equation for the (002) reflection. In contrast, as previously studied, CON‐10 and CON‐16 did not show any characteristic signal in the PXRD patterns (Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0002">2</link>b, blue and red lines, respectively); however, weak π‐π interactions and/or amorphous features could be found in the hump‐like characteristics, ranging approximately from 20° to 30°, as shown in the inset PXRD patterns.<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0021 #cssc202100545-bib-0022"><sup>[21,22]</sup></link> Upon the hybridization of CONs with GNS, a small but distinguishable (002) graphite peak for both CON‐G‐10 and CON‐G‐16 was detected, suggesting that the CONs in the hybrids are well distributed in the matrices of GNs. Nonetheless, the considerably lower intensity of the (002) peak for the hybrids than that for GNs implied that the independently agglomerated phases of the CONs and GNs are negligible. This suggested that CON‐G‐10 and CON‐G‐16 had weak crystallinity and a low structural ordering and that the layered components (CONs and GNs) in these hybrids would be randomly stacked to form turbostratic structures, as illustrated in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0002">2</link>c.</p><p>Upon varying the synthetic condition, the structural evolution via supramolecular interactions was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as depicted in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0003">3</link>. The CON‐G‐10 hybrid synthesized by the reflux reaction exhibited planar sheet‐like morphologies, while CON‐G‐16 exhibited distinct morphologies where sheet‐like plates surrounded thread‐like fibers. The CON‐16 fibers synthesized by a solvothermal reaction exhibited a fibrous morphology in our previous study (Figure S5 see Supporting Information).<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0023"><sup>[23]</sup></link> However, the electron microscopy images suggested that the CON‐16 fibers in this study could be surrounded by GNs. Conversely, CON‐G‐10 exhibited a stacked structure consisting of GNs and CON‐10, derived from the planar morphologies of each of the nanosheets. An in‐depth inspection of the morphologies was confirmed by TEM observation, along with energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (EDS) to determine the distribution of elements. In Figure S6 (see Supporting Information), the EDS mapping shows that all the elements, including carbon and heteroatoms, are uniformly distributed throughout the network. In particular, CON‐G‐10 consisted of typical thin sheets characterized by ruffled and folded morphologies, as shown in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0003">3</link>c. Moreover, as magnified in the selected area of the TEM image with a dotted red circle (inset image in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0003">3</link>c), the CON networks were successfully formed with 2–3 nm mesopores (denoted with white arrows in the inset of Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0003">3</link>c). This pore size was in good agreement with the calculated pore size (2.8 nm) determined by DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6‐31G level, based on the CON framework model of Scheme <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-5001">1</link>. The fiber‐like morphologies of CON‐G‐16 observed in SEM were also confirmed by TEM analysis (Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0003">3</link>d), and the magnified area, denoted by a dotted red circle, also shows 2–3 nm‐sized mesopores of CONs (white arrows in the inset of Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0003">3</link>d). Based on a careful TEM analysis of CON‐G‐16, the fiber‐like morphologies were derived from the CONs. Therefore, here, it was suggested that the solvothermal route favors branched morphologies, since the interaction between GNs and CONs is inhibited. In addition, the molecular interactions between CONs and GNs, as predicted by the UV/Vis and PXRD analysis results (Figures <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0002">2</link>c and d), were successfully supported by the SEM and TEM analyses.</p><figure xml:id="cssc202100545-fig-0003"><label>3</label><title type="figureName">Figure</title><mediaResourceGroup><mediaResource alt="image" href="urn:x-wiley:18645631:media:cssc202100545:cssc202100545-fig-0003"/><mediaResource alt="magnified image" rendition="webHiRes" mimeType="image/png" href="graphic/cssc202100545-fig-0003-m.png"/></mediaResourceGroup><caption><p>SEM images of (a) CON‐G‐10 and (b) CON‐G‐16, respectively; TEM images of (c) CON‐G‐10 and (d) CON‐G‐16, respectively; the inset images in (c) and (d) are the magnified images of the areas highlighted with red dotted circles.</p></caption></figure><p>In particular, more detailed information on the basal spacings was obtained from the brightness profiles of the TEM images at the local crystalline domains, as shown in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0004">4</link>. In general, the basal spacing of multistacked GNs having above 10 layers is converged to 0.34 nm,<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0046 #cssc202100545-bib-0047"><sup>[46,47]</sup></link> while those of CON‐10 and 16 were found to be larger than 0.34 nm (0.34–0.38 nm), as reported in the literature.<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0022"><sup>[22]</sup></link> The enlarged interlayer distances of the 2D carbonaceous materials increase the accessibility to Na<sup>+</sup> species, eventually enhancing the electrochemical Na‐storage properties. Therefore, the basal spacings of each layer in CON‐G‐10 and CON‐G‐16 were investigated at some of the stacked regions, as denoted in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0004">4</link> with the red rectangles and the corresponding brightness profiles. As shown in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0004">4</link>a, the CON‐G‐10 hybrid had two different basal spacings. The average basal spacing of the bright regions (Regions 1–3) was estimated as 3.4 nm, which is almost identical to the known value for GNs (Figure S7, see Supporting Information). In contrast, that of the relatively dark region (Region 4) was estimated as 3.6 nm, indicating CON phases which were proven in the previous literature with fast Fourier transform (FFT).<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0048"><sup>[48]</sup></link> Therefore, it could be suggested that CONs formed framework structures on GNs surfaces rather than existed in amorphous polymers even though CONs did not show diffraction peaks in PXRD (Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0002">2</link>b). The FFTs of hybrids are presented in Figure S8 showing spots in (001) positions (see Supporting Information). The basal spacings at the interface of the two domains were quite different, implying that strong supramolecular interactions, such as Van der Waals forces, induced intimate contact between the primary nanolayers of CON‐10 and GNs. As shown in Figure S9 in Supporting Information, two domains with different brightness profiles and basal spacings were stacked, and some parts slightly penetrated the other domain (denoting with a white‐dotted circle). Therefore, it was confirmed that the CONs and GNs were stacked upon hybridization via the reflux reaction. However, it was difficult to detect such interfaces for CON‐G‐16, while it was relatively easy to confirm the segregated phases, including GNs (Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0004">4</link>b) with a basal spacing of 3.4 nm or CONs (Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0004">4</link>c) with a basal spacing of 3.6 nm.</p><figure xml:id="cssc202100545-fig-0004"><label>4</label><title type="figureName">Figure</title><mediaResourceGroup><mediaResource alt="image" href="urn:x-wiley:18645631:media:cssc202100545:cssc202100545-fig-0004"/><mediaResource alt="magnified image" rendition="webHiRes" mimeType="image/png" href="graphic/cssc202100545-fig-0004-m.png"/></mediaResourceGroup><caption><p>(a), (b), and (c) TEM images of CON‐G‐10, GNs phases in CON‐G‐16, and CON phases in CON‐G‐16, respectively, on the left side; brightness profiles of the selected areas (red‐line regions) in (a), (b), and (c). TEM images are placed next to the corresponding images on the right side, respectively.</p></caption></figure><p>In addition, the lateral size and thickness of primary particles for both CONs and hybrids were investigated with atomic force microscopy (AFM) as shown in Figure S10 (see Supporting Information). The CON‐10 and CON‐16 showed the average aspect ratio (diameter/thickness) of approximately 20 and 16–17, respectively, which meant the diameter of primary particles was larger than thickness. The tendency was well consistent with the fact that the primary particles were thin and plate‐like in 2D structures proven by TEM and SEM studies. However, as CONs were hybridized with GNs, the average aspect ratio slightly decreased to approximately 8 for CON‐G‐10 and 10 for CON‐G‐16, respectively. This fact implied that the hybrids were successfully developed in thin‐layered structures. Presumably, the decreased aspect ratio of primary particles for the series of CON‐Gs was due to the stacked graphene layers on CONs or vice‐versa upon being hybridized. Therefore, to elucidate the porous properties of the hybrids, including the Brunauer‐Emmett‐Teller (BET) surface area, the N<sub>2</sub> gas adsorption/desorption behaviors of CONs and hybrids were isothermally profiled at 77 K, (the isotherm of GN in Supporting Information, Figure S11a) and their pore‐size distribution was calculated through the Barrett‐Joyner‐Halenda (BJH) method, as shown in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0005">5</link> (BJH pore size distribution of GN in Figure S11b). The micro and macroporosity of all the materials are presented in Figure S12 (see Supporting Information).To evaluate the structure and property changes upon hybridization, the isotherms of the bare CON‐10 and 16 were also investigated as references. All the isotherms were found to be type II, according to the IUPAC classification.<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0049 #cssc202100545-bib-0050"><sup>[49,50]</sup></link> The calculated BET surface areas were 300, 228, 98, 85, and 11 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup> for CON‐16, CON‐10, CON‐G‐16, CON‐G‐10, and GN respectively. The surface areas were derived from the initial gas uptake amount of micropores at near <i>P</i>/<i>P</i><sub>0</sub>‐0.1. Although the CON frameworks had mesopores, as proven in the TEM analysis, they did not show the typical isotherm of mesoporous materials due to their random agglomeration in their solid states. Upon hybridizing CONs with GNs, the amount of the initial gas uptake dramatically decreased (Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0005">5</link>a), diminishing the BET surface areas of the hybrids compared with those of the bare CONs. Consequently, the micro and micro/mesostructure of the CONs could be clogged with GNs by fabricating multistacked nanostructures for CON‐G‐10 and CON‐G‐16, as proven in the SEM and TEM analyses. This fact was also supported by the pore‐size distribution profiles (Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0005">5</link>b), obtained by the BJH method, which showed that the 2.4 nm pores disappeared after hybridization.</p><figure xml:id="cssc202100545-fig-0005"><label>5</label><title type="figureName">Figure</title><mediaResourceGroup><mediaResource alt="image" href="urn:x-wiley:18645631:media:cssc202100545:cssc202100545-fig-0005"/><mediaResource alt="magnified image" rendition="webHiRes" mimeType="image/png" href="graphic/cssc202100545-fig-0005-m.png"/></mediaResourceGroup><caption><p>(a) N<sub>2</sub> adsorption/desorption isotherm profiles and (b) BJH pore‐size distributions of CONs and the hybrids; in (a), the color‐filled/empty symbols represent the adsorption/desorption branches, respectively</p></caption></figure><p>The charge‐discharge characteristics of the hybrids toward Na were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) for 15 continuous cycles at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s<sup>−1</sup>, with a potential window of 0.01–2.5 V, as demonstrated in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0006">6</link>. In the first cycle, CON‐G‐10 displayed a noticeably irreversible cathodic peak at approximately 0.06 V (Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0006">6</link>a), which was associated with the electrolyte decomposition together with the formation of a solid‐electrolyte interphase (SEI). However, after consecutive cycles, this large peak at 0.06 V almost disappeared, and the CV profiles converged with each other after the fourth scan onward, indicating a reversible sodiation‐desodiation reaction. Notably, broad cathodic peaks at approximately 0.86 V appeared from the second cycle to the fifth cycle, and these broad peaks slightly converged at 0.98 V after the sixth cycle. This indicates a capacitive process due to the weak interaction between the sulfur atoms on the frameworks and the Na<sup>+</sup> ions.<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0051 #cssc202100545-bib-0052"><sup>[51,52]</sup></link> The cycle trends of CON‐G‐16 were very similar to those of CON‐G‐10.</p><figure xml:id="cssc202100545-fig-0006"><label>6</label><title type="figureName">Figure</title><mediaResourceGroup><mediaResource alt="image" href="urn:x-wiley:18645631:media:cssc202100545:cssc202100545-fig-0006"/><mediaResource alt="magnified image" rendition="webHiRes" mimeType="image/png" href="graphic/cssc202100545-fig-0006-m.png"/></mediaResourceGroup><caption><p>CV profiles of (a) CON‐G‐10 and (b) CON‐G‐16 at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s<sup>−1</sup>.</p></caption></figure><p>However, the first cathodic peak more strongly appeared at around 0.17, and the broad capacitive peaks converged to 1 V with a higher apparent current density than that of CON‐G‐10.

In addition, the CV profiles of the hybrids exhibited strong redox peaks at approximately 1.9 V/1.0 V and 2.0 V/1.1 V for CON‐G‐10 and CON‐G‐16 (vs. Na/Na<sup>+</sup>), respectively, corresponding to the sodiation‐desodiation process in the thiophene units of their backbones.<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0051 #cssc202100545-bib-0052"><sup>[51,52]</sup></link> The high‐voltage hysteresis in the CV profiles could be ascribed to the highly porous and crosslinked structures of the frameworks, as found in similar CV studies on poly(3,3’‐thiophene).<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0022 #cssc202100545-bib-0053"><sup>[22,53]</sup></link> Although all the CV profiles after the first cycle suggested the interaction between Na ions and the heteroatoms, this interaction should be predominantly non‐covalent, as evidenced by the broad CV peaks.

However, the CONs used in CON‐G‐10 and CON‐G‐16 exhibited very weak and broad peaks, demonstrating weak interactions between the samples and cations.<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0053 #cssc202100545-bib-0054 #cssc202100545-bib-0055 #cssc202100545-bib-0056 #cssc202100545-bib-0057"><sup>[53–57]</sup></link> Moreover, a small anodic peak at ∼0.1 V in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0006">6</link>b is ascribed to the insertion of Na<sup>+</sup> in the micropores, which means that sodium ions are stored by pore‐filling mechanism.<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0058 #cssc202100545-bib-0059"><sup>[58,59]</sup></link> This anodic peak was found in the CV profiles of the bare CON‐10 and CON‐16 as reported in the previous literatures.<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0021 #cssc202100545-bib-0022"><sup>[21,22]</sup></link> Therefore, the anodic peak detected at around 0.1 V in the profiles of CON‐G‐16 can suggest that significant amount of CON‐16 in CON‐G‐16 could form segregated domains.

In particular, to remove the capacity‐fading effect for the earlier cycles, the CV profiles were measured after 15 continuous scans with a sweep rate of 0.1 mV s<sup>−</sup>. Moreover, a power‐law relationship was utilized to demonstrate the charge‐storage mechanisms of the anodes, including the capacitive processes and diffusion‐controlled Faradaic mechanism. The power‐law relationship is expressed as <i>i</i>=<i>aν</i><sup><i>b</i></sup>, where <i>ν</i> is the CV scan rate, <i>i</i> is the current, and <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are the empirically variable parameters related to the charge‐storage characteristics of the system. In particular, as <i>b</i> is generally associated with the charge‐storage mechanism in anodes, the values of <i>b</i> were determined from the slopes of the log(<i>i</i>) vs log(<i>ν</i>) plots, shown in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0007">7</link>c and d, after recording the current values at specific voltages denoted as A and B in Figures <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0007">7</link>a and b. In general, when <i>b</i> is close to 0.5, the charge‐storage mechanism corresponds to the diffusion‐controlled Faradaic mechanism; as <i>b</i> converges to 1, the charge‐storage mechanism can be classified as the capacitive process.<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0060 #cssc202100545-bib-0061"><sup>[60,61]</sup></link> For CON‐G‐10 (Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0007">7</link>c), the <i>b</i> values were determined to be 0.74 from ∼0.6 V (Peak B in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0007">7</link>a) and 0.67 from ∼2 V (Peak A in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0007">7</link>a). For CON‐G‐16, the <i>b</i> values were determined to be 0.70 from ∼0.6 (Peak B in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0007">7</link>b) and 0.66 from ∼2 V (Peak A in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0007">7</link>b). The hybrids showed higher <i>b</i> values than those of conventional battery electrodes (<i>b</i>≈0.5), indicating the relatively higher contribution of the capacitive process. However, it was still difficult to concern these <i>b</i> values were close to 1. Therefore, it could be suggested, as shown in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0006">6</link>, that the interaction between Na<sup>+</sup> and the hybrids did not form strong covalent bonds, but the Na<sup>+</sup> ions were weakly adsorbed on polarizable hybrid surfaces. Since the anodic and cathodic currents from all the CV characteristics were well proportional to the square roots of the scan rates, the major mechanism of charge storage for the hybrid materials could also be explained by mass‐transfer processes.</p><figure xml:id="cssc202100545-fig-0007"><label>7</label><title type="figureName">Figure</title><mediaResourceGroup><mediaResource alt="image" href="urn:x-wiley:18645631:media:cssc202100545:cssc202100545-fig-0007"/><mediaResource alt="magnified image" rendition="webHiRes" mimeType="image/png" href="graphic/cssc202100545-fig-0007-m.png"/></mediaResourceGroup><caption><p>CV profiles of (a) CON‐G‐10 and (b) CON‐G‐16 at various scan rates.

The applied current densities were changed every five cycles, and after a few cycles up to 1000 mA g<sup>−1</sup>, the current density was reverted to 100 mA g<sup>−1</sup> while maintaining the potential window (vs. Na/Na<sup>+</sup>), as shown in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0008">8</link>. At approximately 0.5 V, the first discharge profiles for both hybrids clearly recorded plateau regions, which were ascribed to the SEI layer formation, as predicted by the CV profiles. The corresponding first discharge capacities upon the SEI formation were 800 and 700 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> for CON‐G‐10 and CON‐G‐16, respectively. By comparing the first discharge capacities in a previous study utilizing CON‐10 (∼1030 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>) and CON‐16 (850 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>), it was found that the hybridization of CON‐10 and −16 with GNs lowered the first discharge capacities, implying a suppressed SEI layer formation.<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0021"><sup>[21]</sup></link> This tendency resulted from the relatively low external surface area of the hybrids, as proven by the BET analysis. This suppressed SEI layer formation ensured high reversibility of the charge/discharge process of the hybrids. Although the BET surface area of CON‐G‐16 was much lower than that of CON‐G‐10 upon hybridization, the SEI layer formation of CON‐G‐10 was much more suppressed than that of CON‐G‐16 compared with those of their pristine CONs. Therefore, the synergetic effect could be rationalized with the diminished external surfaces, and the synergetic effect could be considered to result from the enhanced electrical conductivity due to the GNs. In particular, the layer‐by‐layer hybrid phase in CON‐G‐10 had more influence on both the suppressed SEI layer formation and the reversibility of the charge/discharge process, because the overall discharge capacities of CON‐G‐10 were considerably higher than those of CON‐G‐16 at every current density.</p><figure xml:id="cssc202100545-fig-0008"><label>8</label><title type="figureName">Figure</title><mediaResourceGroup><mediaResource alt="image" href="urn:x-wiley:18645631:media:cssc202100545:cssc202100545-fig-0008"/><mediaResource alt="magnified image" rendition="webHiRes" mimeType="image/png" href="graphic/cssc202100545-fig-0008-m.png"/></mediaResourceGroup><caption><p>Charge‐discharge profiles of (a) CON‐G‐10 and (b) CON‐G‐16 with varying current densities.</p></caption></figure><p>As the electrical conductivities of the hybrids were investigated using the charge/discharge profiles, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted for CONs, hybrids and neat GN to confirm their electrical conductivities and investigate their mass‐diffusion properties, as shown in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0009">9</link>.

In general, the radius values of the EIS plots in the high‐frequency regions for both materials (Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0009">9</link>a) represent the charge‐carrier conductivity, whereas the slope values of the Warburg plots from the low‐frequency regions of EIS, also known as Warburg coefficients, represent the ion mobilities (Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0009">9</link>b).<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0059 #cssc202100545-bib-0060"><sup>[59,60]</sup></link> Based on this fact, it was clearly demonstrated that the electrical conductivity of CON‐G‐10 was significantly better than that of CON‐G‐16, as the EIS plot of CON‐G‐10 displayed a semicircle with a smaller radius than that of CON‐G‐16. Notably, both the film resistance (<i>R</i><sub>f</sub>) and the charge‐carrier resistance (<i>R</i><sub>ct</sub>) of CON‐G‐10 was the smallest among the other types of CONs and hybrids. Nonetheless, the radius of the semicircle in the EIS plot of CON‐G‐16 was smaller than that of the bare CON‐16 (Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0009">9</link>a, gray line). Therefore, the hybridization of CONs and GNs could be considered as an effective strategy for enhancing the electrical conductivity of the materials. Interestingly, the EIS plot of CON‐G‐16 showed two different domains of semicircles. Normally, in this case, the first semicircle corresponds to the film resistance, while the second semicircle corresponds to the charge‐transfer resistance.<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0059 #cssc202100545-bib-0060"><sup>[59,60]</sup></link> The CON phases and GNs could be severely segregated without forming overlapped interfaces, as evidenced by the fibrous and layered morphologies of CON‐G‐16. Conversely, CON‐G‐10 having a 2D morphology had much more intact interfaces between the CONs and GNs, showing the synergetic effects in the EIS plots, which was proven and predicted by the TEM and SEM analyses.<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0061"><sup>[61]</sup></link> Although the semicircle from EIS profile for GN was somewhat larger than those for hybrids, it was obviously found that that for GN was smaller than CON‐10 showing the similarity with CON‐16.<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0062"><sup>[62]</sup></link> This synergetic effect could imply that the <i>R</i><sub>s</sub> (sheet resistance), <i>R</i><sub>f</sub> and <i>R</i><sub>ct</sub> of CON‐G‐10 was reduced as GNs were well incorporated in CON matrices.

It was also confirmed that the Na<sup>+</sup> ions were well fluxed on the CON‐G‐10 electrode, contrary to the case on the CON‐G‐16 electrode. Although the BET surface area of CON‐G‐16 (98 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>) was larger than that of CON‐G‐10 (85 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>), the Na<sup>+</sup> ions were more mobile on the surface of CON‐G‐10, implying that the accessibility of ions on CON‐G‐10 was greater than that on CON‐G‐16. This ion‐mobility trend could be attributed to their morphologies. The resistance of the ion flux on the plate‐like surface of CON‐G‐10 is low, compared to that on the surface of CON‐G‐16.</p><p>Since the CV analysis and power‐law plots (Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0007">7</link>) implied that storage process is mainly governed by the pseudocapacitive process with some degree of the diffusion‐controlled Faradaic mechanism, CV profiles were thoroughly analyzed to demonstrate the quantitative contribution ratio between the two mechanisms, as shown in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0010">10</link>.<link href="#cssc202100545-bib-0063 #cssc202100545-bib-0064 #cssc202100545-bib-0065 #cssc202100545-bib-0066"><sup>[63–66]</sup></link> The results revealed that the pseudocapacitive ratio of CON‐G‐10 gradually increased from 46.0 to 72.7 % with varying the scan rate from 0.1 to 0.8 mV s<sup>−1</sup>. However, CON‐G‐16 exhibited a relatively small contribution of pseudocapacitance than CON‐G‐10, varying from 39.4 % to 66.5 %, which is consistent with the results shown in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0007">7</link>, with a relatively small <i>b</i> value. As predicted by the EIS studies, CON‐G‐10 possessed a more ion‐accessible structure than CON‐G‐16, where CON‐16 was encapsulated with GNs. Therefore, Na<sup>+</sup> can easily interact with the polarizable surface of CON‐G‐10 through non‐covalent interactions, leading to an increase in the contribution of the pseudocapacitive process.</p><figure xml:id="cssc202100545-fig-0010"><label>10</label><title type="figureName">Figure</title><mediaResourceGroup><mediaResource alt="image" href="urn:x-wiley:18645631:media:cssc202100545:cssc202100545-fig-0010"/><mediaResource alt="magnified image" rendition="webHiRes" mimeType="image/png" href="graphic/cssc202100545-fig-0010-m.png"/></mediaResourceGroup><caption><p>Contribution of the diffusion‐controlled and pseudocapacitive charge‐storage process in functioning cells with a scan rate of 0.8 mV s<sup>−1</sup> for (a) CON‐G‐10 and (b) CON‐G‐16.

Therefore, the hybrid materials seized at different states and voltages were subjected to FTIR spectrometry in <i>ex‐situ</i> manner. As a result, series of Na<sub>2</sub>S vibration modes were observed and their intensities were varied at the different states as shown in Figure S13 (see Supporting Information). In contrast, those of other vibrational modes such as C=C did not significantly change. Therefore, it can be suggested that most of sodium are bound at sulfur atoms and reversibly unbound from them.</p><p>To further understand the impact of the GNs inclusion, the rate capabilities and cycling performances of the hybrids were analyzed together with those of the CONs, as shown in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0011">11</link>, with varying the current density after every five cycles from 100 mA g<sup>−1</sup> to 1000 mA g<sup>−1</sup>. After 30 cycles, the current density was reverted to 100 mA g<sup>−1</sup>. Similar to the case in the previous study on the charge/discharge behaviors, the first cycles were related to the SEI layer formation, resulting in an unusually large discrepancy between the charge and discharge capacities. Therefore, in the first cycle for all the materials, an irreversible charge/discharge behavior was observed, and these behaviors are quantitatively summarized in Figure S14 (see Supporting Information) with the Coulombic efficiencies (see Supporting Information). However, as all the materials showed quite reversible discharge capacities from the second cycles at 100 mA g<sup>−1</sup>, their cyclic performance and rate capabilities are highlighted from the second cycles in Figure <link href="#cssc202100545-fig-0011">11</link>. First, CON‐G‐10 recorded a reversible discharge capacity of ∼320 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>, while that of CON‐10 was ∼280 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>. The average discharge capacities of CON‐G‐10 at 300, 500, 700, 900, and 1000 mA g<sup>−1</sup> were approximately 250, 230, 198, 150, and 120 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, while those of CON‐10 (the pristine form of CON‐G‐10) were found to be approximately 173, 141, 126, 108, and 97 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. In addition, in the second cycle at 100 mA g<sup>−1</sup>, CON‐G‐16 exhibited a discharge capacity of ∼250 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>, while that of CON‐16 (pristine form of CON‐G‐16) was 280 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>. Further, at 300, 500, 700, 900, and 100 mA g<sup>−1</sup>, the average discharge capacities of CON‐G‐16 were approximately 173, 143, 118, 75, and 66 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, whereas, at the same current densities, those of CON‐16 were approximately 196, 162, 145, 131, and 123 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>. After the current density was restored to 100 mA g<sup>−1</sup> (after 30 cycles), the discharge capacity of CON‐G‐10 was reverted to ∼295 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>, which was a ∼93 % retention rate. However, the discharge capacity of CON‐G‐16 was restored to ∼200 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>, which was ∼80 % of its second‐cycle capacity after 30 cycles. Moreover, the pristine CONs, including CON‐10 and CON‐16, showed a retention rate of approximately 85 % after 30 cycles. Therefore, CON‐G‐10 exhibited the best charge/discharge capacities and rate capabilities among the materials used in this study. Furthermore, CON‐G‐10 exhibited higher performance than CON‐10; in particular, the discharge capacity of CON‐G‐10 was approximately 1.5 times higher than that of CON‐10 at all current densities. Although the BET surface area of CON‐G‐10 was much lower than that of CON‐16, the charge/discharge performance of CON‐G‐10 was higher than that of CON‐16, except at the current density of 1000 mA g<sup>−1</sup>. This outstanding performance of CON‐G‐10 over the cycle range was primarily attributed to the low charge‐carrier transport resistance, accompanied by the hybridization with GNs rather than the ion mobility.</p><figure xml:id="cssc202100545-fig-0011"><label>11</label><title type="figureName">Figure</title><mediaResourceGroup><mediaResource alt="image" href="urn:x-wiley:18645631:media:cssc202100545:cssc202100545-fig-0011"/><mediaResource alt="magnified image" rendition="webHiRes" mimeType="image/png" href="graphic/cssc202100545-fig-0011-m.png"/></mediaResourceGroup><caption><p>Cycling performance of CON‐G‐10 (bright blue), CON‐G‐16 (red), CON‐16 (deep blue), and CON‐10 (bright green) with varying current densities from 100 to 1000 mA g<sup>−1</sup> and reverting to 100 mA g<sup>−1</sup>. Color‐filled and empty squares denote the discharge and charge capacities.</p></caption></figure><p>However, the overall performance of CON‐G‐16 was worse than that of its pristine form, even though it gained better electrical conductivity upon hybridization, as proven by the EIS profiles. This worse performance of CON‐G‐16 could be attributed to the extreme reduction of the external surface area forming the encapsulated CON‐16 in the hybrid network. Such morphology could prevent ions from accessing the heteroatoms and/or CON frameworks. After the first 30 cycles with varying the current density in a regulatory manner, the charge/discharge performances of all the materials were recycled up to 60 cycles with 100 mA g<sup>−1</sup>. CON‐G‐10 demonstrated superb reversible and stable performances, maintaining effective mass flux properties and fast charge transport for successive cycles. The incorporation of GNs into the CON networks enhanced the electrical conductivity, eventually increasing the electrochemical properties of the hybrids, including the charge/discharge capacity. In addition, CON‐G‐10 showed high cycling performance and capacity retention (Figure S15, see Supporting Information), highlighting that the rational design of organic/inorganic hybrid could result in the enhanced electrochemical stability compared with organic electrodes prepared without thermal treatment. For fair comparison between the CON/GN systems in this study with other relative systems, performances of the various organic anode materials were summarized in Table S2 (see Supporting Information).</p><p>Furthermore, the charge/discharge profiles and cyclic performance of bare GNs and Super P together with their coulombic efficiencies at each cycle were also analyzed with applying the current density of 300 mA g<sup>−1</sup> for GNs (Figure S16) and 100 mA g<sup>−1</sup> for Super P (Figure S17). From the fair comparisons with all materials used in this study, It was found that the discharge capacity of Super P showed lowest values and CONs and hybrids showed approximately 2–3 times higher than Super P. Moreover, if we have the hypothetical mixture between the bare GNs and the bare CONs, the discharge capacity of the hypothetical mixture should be much smaller than those of the bare CONs. However, as found in our results on the electrochemical charge/discharge experiments, the CON‐G‐10 had much larger discharge capacity than that of the hypothetical mixture between CONs and GNs, implying the synergetic effect of CON/GN system. We believe that a well‐overlapped morphology between CON and GN could eventually lead to the enhancement of electrical conductivity, resulting in the increased electrochemical performance.</p></section><section xml:id="cssc202100545-sec-0003" numbered="no"><title type="main">Conclusion</title><p>Covalent organic nanosheet (CON) frameworks were polymerized in the presence of graphene nanosheets (GNs) using the Stille cross‐coupling reaction to hybridize the CON frameworks with GNs, via two different reaction routes (solvothermal and reflux methods). Although the same building units for the CONs were used for the hybridization, the electrochemical properties of the resulting hybrids differed depending on the hybridizing conditions. To gain insights into the material design principles that can be applied to sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), a careful comparative study was performed between the two types of hybrids, as well as the pristine CONs, prepared in the same reaction systems. Here, two different 2D materials: CONs and GNs, were well hybridized under reflux (CON‐G‐10), forming intimate stacking of layers, and these two materials formed segregated domains under solvothermal conditions (CON‐G‐16). In particular, CON‐G‐10 formed interpenetrating phases at the interfaces between the CONs and GNs, which could significantly influence the entire charge/discharge characteristics of the Na<sup>+</sup> ions, because the well‐mixed GNs enhanced the charge‐carrier conductivities on the CON surface through the effectively polarizing surfaces. Therefore, the actual surface area that can promote accessibility to Na<sup>+</sup> could be increased to improve the charge/discharge capacity of SIBs. The comparison of the charge/discharge cyclic performances of the CONs and hybrids confirmed that the actual accessible surface area is more important than the potential surface area (calculated by BET) and that controlling the material conductivity is a possible method for increasing the actual ion‐accessible surface area through applicable synthetic strategies. These results suggested that the wide array of hybridizing routes and combinations would result in desirable SIB performances. Furthermore, this study provides a platform for transitioning academic research endeavors into commercial technologies, as it affords information on the physicochemical properties of each component of hybrid electrodes</p></section><section xml:id="cssc202100545-sec-0004" numbered="no"><title type="main">Experimental Section</title><p><b>Materials</b>: 2,4,6‐Tris(5‐bromothiophene‐2‐yl)‐1,3,5‐triazine and 2,5‐bis(trimethylstannyl)thieno‐(3,2‐b)thiophene were obtained from Luminescence Technology (Lum‐Tec).

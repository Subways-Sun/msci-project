        "abstract": "A black phosphorus (BP)/Ti3C2 MXene composite was prepared by compositing small BP nanoparticles with exfoliated Ti3C2 layers. When used as an anode for sodium-ion batteries, the BP/Ti3C2 composite electrode exhibited higher specific capacity and better electrode stability than a BP electrode and a Ti3C2 electrode. The results of experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrated that the synergy of BP and Ti3C2 based on a stable interfacial interaction simultaneously reduces the resistances from both electron and Na+ transport, resulting in the impressive electrochemical performance of the BP/Ti3C2 composite in sodium-ion batteries. The synthesis process and research concept could also be extended for further application of MXene materials and studies on sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "As novel \"post lithium-ion batteries\" and promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) suffering from the limited Li resources, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are nowadays emerging and show bright prospects in large-scale energy storage applications due to abundant Na resources. However, a lack of suitable anode materials has become a key obstacle for the development of SIBs. Here we explore the potential of the two-dimensional (2D) Y-C space and identify a novel anode material for SIBs, a new Y4C3 sheet with P3̄m1 crystal symmetry, by means of first-principles swarm structure calculations. This Y4C3P3̄m1 structure has rather good kinetic and thermodynamic stability, possesses intrinsic metallicity, and remains metallic after adsorbing Na atoms, ensuring good electrical conductivity during the SIB cycle. Remarkably, a Y4C3 sheet as an anode for SIBs possesses the essential properties of a high specific capacity (∼752 mA h g-1), a low barrier energy (∼0.1 eV), and suitable open-circuit voltage (0-0.15 V). These characteristics are comparable and even superior to those of another known 2D Y2C anode material, indicating that the Y4C3 sheet can act as an appealing new candidate as an anode material for SIBs and offering new insights into the 2D Y-C space.",

Here, K+ ions are introduced as an electrolyte additive to improve the electrochemical performance via electrostatic shielding, using Sn microparticles (μ-Sn) as a model. Theoretical calculations and experimental results indicate that K+ ions are not incorporated in the electrode, but accumulate on some sites. This accumulation slows down the local sodiation at the \"hot spots\", promotes the uniform sodiation and enhances the electrode stability. Therefore, the electrode maintains a high specific capacity of 565 mAh g-1 after 3000 cycles at 2 A g-1, much better than the case without K+. The electrode also remains an areal capacity of ~3.5 mAh cm-2 after 100 cycles.

        "abstract": "The development of advanced anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) using pitch-based carbon materials has the advantages of low cost, high electrical conductivity and easy structural modification. In this research, various well-established modification techniques for petroleum pitch are integrated, including the use of recrystallized NaCl as molten salt template, pretreatment and high-temperature carbonization under a pure oxygen atmosphere, and the introduction of heteroatoms (N and S) by hydrothermal methods. The resulting two-dimensional carbon nanosheets with multielement modification exhibit enhanced Na+ storage properties, thereby bringing higher cycling stability and superior rate performance. Due to its specific structure and chemical composition, NS-P-OPDC exhibited a high reversible capacity of 406.77 mAh g-1 at a current density of 100 mA g-1 and a superior rate performance of 193.20 mAh g-1 at a current density of 3 A g-1 after being applied to the anode of SIB half-cell. Especially, a capacity retention of 97.7% was still achieved after 4000 cycles. Meanwhile, the full-cell assembled by Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode and NS-P-OPDC anode could provide a reversible capacity of 235.30 mAh g-1 at a current density of 300 mA g-1.

So far, the reported energy density and cycling stability of the Sb-based anodes for SIBs are quite limited and need to be significantly improved. Here, we develop a novel Sb/C hybrid encapsulating the Sb nanorods into highly conductive N and S codoped carbon (Sb@(N, S-C)) frameworks. As an anode for SIBs, the Sb@(N, S-C) hybrid maintains high reversible capacities of 621.1 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 150 cycles, and 390.8 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 1000 cycles. At higher current densities of 2, 5, and 10 A g-1, the Sb@(N, S-C) hybrid also can display high reversible capacities of 534.4, 430.8, and 374.7 mAh g-1, respectively. Such impressive sodium storage properties are mainly attributed to the unique cross-linked carbon networks providing highly conductive frameworks for fast transfer of ions and electrons, alleviating the volume expansion and preventing the agglomeration of Sb nanorods during the cycling.",

        "abstract": "MoS2 , as a classical 2D material, becomes a capable anode candidate for sodium-ion batteries. However, MoS2 presents a disparate electrochemical performance in the ether-based and ester-based electrolyte with unclear mechanism. Herein, tiny MoS2 nanosheets embedded in nitrogen/sulfur-codoped carbon (MoS2 @NSC) networks are designed and fabricated through an uncomplicated solvothermal method. Thanks to the ether-based electrolyte, the MoS2 @NSC shows a unique capacity growth in the original stage of cycling. But in the ester-based electrolyte, MoS2 @NSC shows a usual capacity decay. The increasing capacity puts down to the gradual transformation from MoS2 to MoS3 with the structure reconstruction. Based on the above mechanism, MoS2 @NSC demonstrates an excellent recyclability and the specific capacity keeps around 286 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 after 5000 cycles with an ultralow capacity fading rate of only 0.0034% per cycle. In addition, a MoS2 @NSC‖Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 full cell with ether-based electrolyte is assembled and demonstrates a capacity of 71 mAh g-1 , suggesting the potential application of MoS2 @NSC. Here the electrochemical conversion mechanism of MoS2 is revealed in the ether-based electrolyte and significance of the electrolyte design on the promoting Na ion storage behavior is highlighted.",

Here, we use a synergistic approach to enhance the sodium storage performance of the micron-sized FeS2 through voltage control (0.5-3 V), binder choice, and graphene coating. The FeS2 electrode with the synergistic approach exhibits high specific capacity (524 mA h g-1), long cycle life (87.8% capacity retention after 800 cycles), and excellent rate capability (323 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1).

        "abstract": "Manganese-based chalcogenides would be of latent capacity in serving as anodes for assembling lithium- and/or sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs) due to their large theoretical capacity, low price, and low-toxicity functionality, while the low electroconductivity and easy agglomeration behavior may impede their technical applications. Here, a solid-state solution of MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes in rock-salt phase has been synthesized for the first time at a relatively low temperature from the precursors of Mn(II) acetylacetonate with dibenzyl dichalcogens in oleylamine with octadecene, and the MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes have been assembled with N-doped graphene to form a new kind of heterostructured nanohybrids (shortened as MnS0.5Se0.5/N-G hybrids), which are very potential for the fabrication of metal-ion batteries including LIBs and/or SIBs. Investigations revealed that there have been dense vacancies generated and active sites increased via nonequilibrium alloying of MnS and MnSe into the solid-solution MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes with segregation and defects achieved in the low-temperature solution synthetic route. Meanwhile, the introduction of N-doped graphene forming heterojunction interfaces between MnS0.5Se0.5 and N-doped graphene would efficiently enhance their electroconductivity and avoid agglomeration of the active MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes with considerably improved electrochemical properties. As a result, the MnS0.5Se0.5/N-G hybrids delivered superior Li/Na storage capacities with outstanding rate performance as well as satisfactorily lasting stability (1039/457 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 for LIBs/SIBs). Additionally, full-cell LIBs of the anodic MnS0.5Se0.5/N-G constructed with cathodic LiFePO4 (LFP) further confirmed the promising future for their practical application.",

Molten salt etching is not only short in time but also safe and simple, laying a good foundation for industrialization. Here, we compare the traditional F‐containing etching method with the molten salt etching method. Transmission electron microscopy elemental mapping images and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy show that the Ti3C2Tx surface end of traditional etching is terminated by –F, while the Ti3C2Tx surface end of molten salt etching is terminated by –Cl. Finally, the sodium‐ion batteries are fabricated and the performance difference of the three etching methods is compared. The results show that the capacity of 102.1 mAh g–1 can still be reached when the molten salt etching MXene material returns to 0.1 A g–1 after the current density of 5 A g–1. After 500 cycles at 1 A g–1, there is no significant loss of capacity and the Coulomb efficiency is close to 100%.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) have attracted much attention due to integrating the high energy density of battery and high out power of supercapacitors. However, rapid Na+ diffusion kinetics in cathode is counterbalanced with sluggish anode, hindering the further advancement and commercialization of SIHCs. Here, aiming at conversion-type metal sulfide anode, taking typical VS2 as an example, a comprehensive regulation of nanostructure and electronic properties through NH4 + pre-intercalation and Mo-doping VS2 (Mo-NVS2 ) is reported. It is demonstrated that NH4 + pre-intercalation can enlarge the interplanar spacing and Mo-doping can induce interlayer defects and sulfur vacancies that are favorable to construct new ion transport channels, thus resulting in significantly enhanced Na+ diffusion kinetics and pseudocapacitance. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that the introduction of NH4 + and Mo-doping enhances the electronic conductivity, lowers the diffusion energy barrier of Na+ , and produces stronger d-p hybridization to promote conversion kinetics of Na+ intercalation intermediates. Consequently, Mo-NVS2 delivers a record-high reversible capacity of 453 mAh g-1 at 3 A g-1 and an ultra-stable cycle life of over 20 000 cycles. The assembled SIHCs achieve impressive energy density/power density of 98 Wh kg-1 /11.84 kW kg-1 , ultralong cycling life of over 15000 cycles, and very low self-discharge rate (0.84 mV h-1 ).",

        "abstract": "Metal phosphides exhibit high energy densities as hosts for lithium/sodium storage owing to their conversion reaction mechanism. Nevertheless, they typically suffer from inferior reversibility and cyclability because of the dissolution of polyphosphides and sluggish electrochemical kinetics. Herein, a series of dual‐bond confined MXene‐MxPy‐G composites have been fabricated, in which MxPy nanoparticles are strongly bound with MXene and graphene nanosheets via Ti─P and C‐P bonds. On one hand, the dual‐bond confinement offers strong adsorption to trap polyphosphides, greatly stabilizing the conversion‐formed products during cycling. On the other hand, dual‐bond immobilization largely promotes electron transfer and ion diffusion, facilitating the reversibility of conversion reactions. As anticipated, these MXene‐MxPy‐G hybrids demonstrate superb lithium/sodium‐storage performance. Particularly, as an anode for lithium‐ion batteries, the MXene‐Sn4P3‐G delivers a high initial coulombic efficiency of 90.1% and a high reversible capacity of 1058.6 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1. Even tested at high rates of 1.0/2.0 A g−1, it can still maintain high reversible capacities of 820.6/726.5 mAh g−1 after 1450 cycles. When applied in pouch full‐cells and sodium‐ion batteries, it also shows extended cyclic lifespans of 350 and 1200 cycles.

        "abstract": "Hard carbons are currently the most widely used negative electrode materials in Na-ion batteries. This is due to their promising electrochemical performance with capacities of 200-300 mAh g-1 and stable long-term cycling. However, an abundant and cheap carbon source is necessary in order to comply with the low-cost philosophy of Na-ion technology. Many biological or waste materials have been used to synthesize hard carbons but the impact of the precursors on the final properties of the anode material is not fully understood. In this study the impact of the biomass source on the structural and electrochemical properties of hard carbons is unraveled by using different, representative types of biomass as examples. The systematic structural and electrochemical investigation of hard carbons derived from different sources-namely corncobs, peanut shells, and waste apples, which are representative of hemicellulose-, lignin- and pectin-rich biomass, respectively-enables understanding and interlinking of the structural and electrochemical properties.",

        "abstract": "Exploiting novel nanomaterials with fast and durable sodium/potassium ion storage capability is key to alleviate the application limitations of lithium-ion batteries. Herein, a novel energy storage material based on cobalt metaphosphate nanosheet arrays self-supported on carbon cloths [Co(PO3)2 NSs/CC] is fabricated by a two-step strategy. This rationally designed strategy avoids the preparation of the complex {Co[O2P(OtBu)2]2}n precursor, which significantly simplifies the synthesis process. The active CC acts not only as an electrically conductive substrate as usual but also as a functional basis to suppress PH3-involved reaction and to promote HPO3-involved reaction during the phosphating process, contributing to the formation of Co(PO3)2. The mutual cross-linked porous Co(PO3)2 nanosheets vertically grow on the surface of activated CC, ensuring sufficient electrolyte infiltration and fast electron transport among the electrodes. Sodium ion storage analysis for the Co(PO3)2 NSs/CC electrode reveals a multi-step reaction mechanism with high reversibility, as reflected by the high reversible capacity (667 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1) and excellent cyclability (with almost no capacity decay over 500 cycles). This novel electrode is also well capable of storing potassium ions, exhibiting high reversible capacity, which outperforms most reported anodes for potassium-ion batteries. The development of this novel high-performance nanomaterial would advance the performance of sodium/potassium-ion batteries toward practical applications.",

        "abstract": "TiO2 as an anode for sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) has attracted much recent attention, but poor cyclability and rate performance remain problematic owing to the intrinsic electronic conductivity and the sluggish diffusivity of Na ions in the TiO2 matrix. Herein, a simple process is demonstrated to improve the sodium storage performance of TiO2 by fabricating a 1D, multichannel, porous binary-phase anatase-TiO2 -rutile-TiO2 composite with oxygen-deficient and high grain-boundary density (denoted as a-TiO2-x /r-TiO2-x ) via electrospinning and subsequent vacuum treatment. The introduction of oxygen vacancies in the TiO2 matrix enables enhanced intrinsic electronic conductivity and fast sodium-ion diffusion kinetics. The porous structure offers easy access of the liquid electrolyte and a short transport path of Na+ through the pores toward the TiO2 nanoparticle. Furthermore, the high density of grain boundaries between the anatase TiO2 and rutile TiO2 offer more interfaces for a novel interfacial storage. The a-TiO2-x /r-TiO2-x shows excellent long cycling stability (134 mAh g-1 at 10 C after 4500 cycles) and superior rate performance (93 mAh g-1 after 4500 cycles at 20 C) for sodium-ion batteries.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (NaIBs) are increasingly being envisioned for grid-scale energy storage systems because of cost advantages. However, implementation of this vision has been challenged by the low energy densities delivered by most NaIB cathodes. Toward addressing this challenge, the authors report the synthesis and characterization of a new iron-doped Na3Fe0.3V1.7O(PO4)2F2 cathode using a novel facile hydrothermal route. The synthesized material was characterized using x ray diffraction, Mössbauer spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy techniques. Obtained discharge capacity in half-cell configuration lies from 119 to 125 to 130 mAh/g at C/10 while tested using three different electrolyte formulations, DMC-EC-PC, DEC-EC, and EC-PC, respectively. The synthesized cathodes were also evaluated in full-cell configurations, which delivered an initial discharge capacity of 80 mAh/g with NaTi2(PO4)3MWCNT as the anode. Ionic diffusivity and interfacial charge transfer kinetics were also evaluated as a function of temperature and sodium concentration, which revealed that electrochemical rate performances in this material were limited by charge transfer kinetics. To understand the heat generation mechanism of the Na/Na3Fe0.3V1.7O(PO4)2F2 half-cell during charge and discharge processes, an electrochemical isothermal calorimetry measurement was carried out at different current rates for two different temperatures (25 and 45°C). The results showed that the amount of heat generated was strongly affected by the operating charge/discharge state, C-rate, and temperature. Overall, this work provides a new synthesis route for the development of iron-doped Na3Fe0.3V1.7O(PO4)2F2-based high-performance sodium cathode material aimed at providing a viable pathway for the development and deployment of large-scale energy storage based on sodium battery systems.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) has been widely adopted as the anode material for sodium ion batteries (NIBs). However, it is troubled by a low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) due to its porous structure. Herein, a graphitized and ultrathin carbon layer coating on HC is proposed to solve this challenge. The as-prepared porous carbon material coated with an ultrathin carbon layer composite (PCS@V@C) exhibits a cavity structure, which is prepared by using bis(cyclopentadienyl) nickel (CP-Ni) as the carbon source for outer coating, glucose carbon spheres as porous carbon, and introducing a silica layer to facilitate the coating process. When utilized as the anode for NIBs, the material shows an ICE increase from 47.1% to 85.3%, and specific capacity enhancement at 0.1 A g-1 from 155.3 to 216.7 mA h g-1. Moreover, its rate capability and cycling performance are outstanding, demonstrating a capacity of 140.3 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1, and a retaining capacity of 225.6 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 with the Coulombic efficiency of 100% at the second cycle. The excellent electrochemical performance of the PCS@V@C is attributed to the ultrathin carbon layer, which is beneficial for the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film. Therefore, this study provides a feasible surface modification method for the preparation of anode materials for NIBs with high specific capacity and ICE.",

Still, major drawbacks for the commercial application of SIBs lie in the slow kinetic processes and poor cycling performance of the devices.

The obtained Sb2O3/N-GNR anode delivers a reversible specific capacity of 642 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 and exhibits a good rate capability. Even after 500 cycles at 5 A g−1, the specific capacity is maintained at about 405 mA h g−1. Such good Na storage performance is mainly ascribed to the beneficial effect of N doping for charge transfer and to the improved microstructure that facilitates the Na+ diffusion through the overall electrode.",

However, their practical application is hindered by the unstable electrolyte and interfacial chemistry at the high-voltage cathode and anode-free side, especially under extreme temperature conditions. Here, an advanced electrolyte design strategy based on electrolyte solvation engineering is presented, which shapes a weakly solvating anion-stabilized (WSAS) electrolyte by balancing the interaction between the Na+-solvent and Na+-anion. The special interaction constructs rich contact ion pairs (CIPs) /aggregates (AGGs) clusters at the electrode/electrolyte interface during the dynamic solvation process which facilitates the formation of a uniform and stable interfacial layer, enabling highly stable cycling of 4.0 V-class layered oxide cathode from -40 °C to 60 °C and excellent reversibility of Na plating/stripping with an ultrahigh average CE of 99.89%. Ultimately, industrial multi-layer anode-free pouch cells using the WSAS electrolyte achieve 80% capacity remaining after 50 cycles and even deliver 74.3% capacity at -30 °C.

        "abstract": "In recent years, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted a lot of attention and are considered an ideal alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The hard carbon (HC) anode in SIBs presents a unique challenge for studying the formation process of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during initial cycling, owing to its distinctive porous structure. This study employs a combination of ultrasonic scanning techniques and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry to conduct an in-depth analysis of the two-dimensional distribution and composition of gases during the formation process. The findings reveal distinct gas evolution behaviors in SIBs compared to LIBs during formation. Notably, significant gas evolution is observed during the discharge phase of the formation cycle in SIBs, with higher discharge rates leading to increased gas evolution rates. This phenomenon is likely attributed to the adsorption of CO2 gas by the abundant pores in HC, followed by desorption during discharge. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the addition of 5A molecular sieves, which competitively adsorb gases, effectively reduces gas adsorption on the anode during formation, thereby significantly enhancing battery performance. This research elucidates the gas adsorption and desorption behavior at the battery interface, providing new insights into the SEI formation process in SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Porous carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are obtained by removing MoO2 nanoparticles from MoO2 @C core@shell nanofibers which are synthesized by phase-segregation via a single-needle electrospinning method. The specific surface area of porous CNTs is 502.9 m2 g-1 , and many oxygen-containing functional groups (COH, CO) are present. As anodes for sodium-ion batteries, the porous CNT electrode displays excellent rate performance and cycling stability (110 mA h g-1 after 1200 cycles at 5 A g-1 ). Those high properties can be attributed to the porous structure and surface modification to steadily store Na+ with high capacity. The work provides a facile and broadly applicable way to fabricate the porous CNTs and their composites for batteries, catalysts, and fuel cells.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries offer a promising alternative to the more expensive, resource-limited lithium-ion batteries, in particular to accommodate the growing demand for large-scale energy storage. One of the main challenges for sodium-ion batteries, however, is the poor electrolyte stability, which leads to rapid capacity fade during cycling. Recent advances in the lithium-ion-battery field have expanded our understanding of electrolyte compositions and stability, paving the way for better sodium-ion-battery electrolytes. Two of the most promising new classes of electrolytes are evaluated herein with a sodium layered-oxide cathode, for the first time: a localized high-concentration electrolyte (LHCE) composed of sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide, dimethyl ether, and tetrafluoropropyl ether and a \"highly fluorinated\" electrolyte (HFE) composed of 20% fluoroethylene carbonate with a lithium difluorophosphate additive. With a combination of electrochemical and post-mortem characterization techniques, the stability of each electrolyte is assessed with the O3-type Na(Ni0.3Fe0.4Mn0.3)O2 cathode and sodium metal anode. Both electrolytes significantly improve the surface and bulk stability of the cathode, but only the LHCE has a meaningful improvement on sodium metal stability. For the purpose of developing a long-lasting, sodium-ion full cell, both classes of electrolyte show great promise.",

        "abstract": "In recent times, few-layer black phosphorus (BP) has attracted tremendous attention as a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries due to its particular two-dimensional structure, good electron conductivity, and high theoretical capacity. The main disadvantages of BP-based materials are the lower practical specific capacity of the BP-based composite than expectation because of the low P atom utilization and the structural fracture due to the large volume expansion that occurs during sodiation/desodiation cycles. In this work, we report a ternary composite comprising BP, graphite, and polyaniline (BP-G/PANI) with a BP mass content of ∼65 wt %. The ternary composite provides an optimized ion pathway (electrolyte → PANI → BP-G → BP), which reduces the charge transfer resistance of the electrode. Also, further ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that the presence of graphite in the BP-G composite allows a deep sodiation of BP and also leads to a higher sodiation/desodiation reversibility. In addition, the uniformly coated PANI also restricts the huge volume expansion of the BP electrode through discharge/charge processes, which promise the stable cycling performance of BP-G/PANI. Thus, our composite shows a high reversible gravimetric capacity of 1530 mAh gcompo.-1 at 0.25 A g-1 and a capacity retention of 520 mAh gcompo.-1 after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 4 A g-1.",

In this work, we propose a rational design of cube‐like CoP @C composites with unique core‐shell structure via in situ phosphating and subsequent carbon coating processes. The uniform carbon coating serves as a physical buffering layer that effectively mitigates volume changes during charge/discharge processes, and prevents particle agglomeration and fragmentation, thereby enhancing the structural stability of electrode. Moreover, the nitrogen‐rich carbon layer not only provides additional active sites for sodium ion adsorption but also improves the electrode conductivity and accelerates charge transport dynamics. Consequently, the as‐synthesized CoP@C exhibits a remarkable capacity retention rate of 94.8% after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g‐1 and achieves a high reversible capacity of 146.7 mAh g‐1 even under a high current density of 4.0 A g‐1.",

        "abstract": "Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a commonly used coating technique for lithium ion battery electrodes. Recently, it has been applied to sodium ion battery anode materials. ALD is known to improve the cycling performance, Coulombic efficiency of batteries, and maintain electrode integrity. Here, the electrochemical performance of uncoated P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 electrodes is compared to that of ALD-coated Al2O3 P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 electrodes. Given that ALD coatings are in the early stage of development for NIB cathode materials, little is known about how ALD coatings, in particular aluminum oxide (Al2O3), affect the electrode-electrolyte interface. Therefore, full characterizations of its effects are presented in this work. For the first time, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to elucidate the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on ALD-coated electrodes. It contains less carbonate species and more inorganic species, which allows for fast Na kinetics, resulting in significant increase in Coulombic efficiency and decrease in cathode impedance. The effectiveness of Al2O3 ALD coating is also surprisingly reflected in the enhanced mechanical stability of the particle which prevents particle exfoliation.",

        "abstract": "The rational design of porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high conductivity and reversible redox activity is the key to improving their performance in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we report a series of COFs (FPDC-TPA-COF, FPDC-TPB-COF, and FPDC-TPT-COF) based on an organosulfur linker, (trioxocyclohexane-triylidene)tris(dithiole-diylylidene))hexabenzaldehyde (FPDC). These COFs feature two-dimensional crystalline structures, high porosity, good conductivity, and densely packed redox-active sites, making them suitable for energy storage devices. Among them, FPDC-TPT-COF demonstrates a remarkably high specific capacity of 420 mAh g-1 (0.2 A g-1), excellent cycling stability (~87% capacity retention after 3000 cycles, 1.0 A g-1) and high rate performance (339 mAh g-1 at 2.0 A g-1) as an anode for SIBs, surpassing most reported COF-based electrodes. The superior performance is attributed to the dithiole moieties enhancing the conductivity and the presence of redox-active carbonyl, imine, and triazine sites facilitating Na storage. Furthermore, the sodiation mechanism was elucidated through in-situ experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work highlights the advantages of integrating multiple functional groups into redox-active COFs for the rational design of efficient and stable SIBs.",

Paired with biocompatible and biodegradable polypyrrole, this full battery system shows excellent sodium storage ability and flexibility, indicating its potential applications in wearable electronics and biointegrated devices.

        "abstract": "The Fe‐based anode of sodium‐ion batteries attracts much attention due to the abundant source, low‐cost, and high specific capacity. However, the low electron and ion transfer rate, poor structural stability, and shuttle effect of NaS2 intermediate restrain its further development. Herein, the Fe3O4/Fe/FeS tri‐heterojunction node spawned N‐carbon nanotube scaffold structure (FHNCS) was designed using the modified MIL‐88B(Fe) as a template followed by catalytic growth and sulfidation process. During catalytic growth process, the reduced Fe monomers catalyze the growth of N‐doped carbon nanotubes to connect the Fe3O4/Fe/FeS tri‐heterojunction node, forming a 3D scaffold structure. Wherein the N‐doped carbon promotes the transfer of electrons between Fe3O4/Fe/FeS particles, and the tri‐heterojunction facilitates the diffusion of electrons at the interface, to organize a 3D conductive network. The unique scaffold structure provides more active sites and shortens the Na+ diffusion path. Meanwhile, the structure exhibits excellent mechanical stability to alleviate the volume expansion during circulation. Furthermore, the Fe in Fe3O4/Fe heterojunction can adjust the d‐band center of Fe in Fe3O4 to enhance the adsorption between Fe3O4 and Na2S intermediate, which restrains the shuttle effect. Therefore, the FHNCS demonstrates a high specific capacity of 436 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, 84.7% and 73.4% of the initial capacities are maintained after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 and 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1.

This one-pot approach greatly reduces the energy consumption and maximizes the efficient use of raw materials. The reaction of elemental tin and antimony in the ionic liquid (IL) trihexyltetradecylphosphonium chloride ([P66614]Cl) at 200 °C led to a microcrystalline powder of single-phase SnSb within 10 h with very high yield (95%). Liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that the IL remains essentially stable during the reaction. It was recovered almost quantitatively by distilling off the organic solvent used for product separation. Composites of SnSb powder and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were fabricated by a simple ball milling process. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the Na‖SnSb/CNTs cell retains close to 100% of its initial capacity after 50 cycles at a current of 50 mA g−1, which is much better than the Na‖SnSb cell. The greatly increased capacity retainability can be attributed to the conductive network formed by CNTs inside the SnSb/CNTs electrode, providing 3D effective and fast electronic pathways during sodium intercalation and de-intercalation.",

Note that it shows one of the best long-term cycling properties reported to date for MoS2-based anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. This regulation strategy may offer new insights into the fabrication of high-performance anode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) is emerging as a popular cathode for sodium-ion batteries owing to its stable structure, high operating voltage, and large energy density. However, its practical application is hindered by its low conductivity. In addition, due to the loss of fluorine during synthesis, Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) impurity is often easily generated, resulting in a decrease in actual operating voltage. Herein, a bifunctional carbon network composed of an N-doped carbon layer and carbon bridge is constructed around NVPF particles. Through pyrolysis of polydopamine (PDA), the NVPF particles are covered in situ by an N-doped carbon layer, and the carbon bridge generated by polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is also coated with N-doped carbon. Besides, PTFE also serves as a fluorine supplement to ensure that pure NVPF is obtained. As a result, the bifunctional N-doped carbon network-modified NVPF delivers a high reversible capacity (125.7 mA h g-1 at 0.2 C) and appreciable cycle stability (92.7% at 1 C over 300 cycles, and 89.8% at 10 C over 1500 cycles). When assembled into a full cell with a commercial hard carbon anode, it displays a discharge median voltage of up to 3.62 V at 0.2 C. Furthermore, it achieves a high energy density of 373.7 W h kg-1 at a power density of 461.2 W kg-1, with an excellent specific energy retention of 78.2% after 200 cycles. Therefore, this modification method is expected to be extended to other fluorine-containing materials with poor electrical conductivity.",

When used as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries, the NDCFs deliver a high reversible capacity of 86.2 mAh g-1 even after 2000 cycles at a high current density of 10.0 A g-1. It is proposed that the excellent Na+ storage performance is mainly due to the defective surface of the NDCFs created by the high content of N dopant.

        "abstract": "Nickle sulfides as promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries have attracted tremendous attention owing to their large specific capacity and good electrical conductivity. However, the relative large volume changes during the sodiation/desodiation process usually result in a fast capacity decay, poor cycling stability, and sluggish electrode kinetics which hinder their practical applications. Herein, NiS1.03 porous hollow spheres (NiS1.03 PHSs) and porous NiS1.03 hollow cages (NiS1.03 PHCs) with high yield are designed and selectively fabricated via a simple solvothermal and subsequent annealing approach.

NiS1.03 PHCs also show high rate capability and outstanding cycling stability. In addition, the analyses results of in situ and ex situ XRD patterns and HRTEM images reveal the reversible Na-ion conversion mechanism of NiS1.03. It is also worth noting that the NiS1.03 PHSs//FeFe(CN)6 full cell is successfully assembled and exhibits an initial reversible capacity of 460 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1, which further evidence that NiS1.03 is a kind of prospective anode material for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium titanate Na2Ti3O7 (NTO) has superior electrochemical properties as an anode material in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), and Nb or V doping is suggested to enhance the electrode performance. In this work, we carry out systematic first-principles calculations of the structural, electronic and electrochemical properties of NTO and Na2Ti2.75M0.25O7 (M = Nb, V), using supercells to reveal the effect of Nb or V NTO-doping on its anode performance. It is found that Nb doping gives rise to the expansion of cell volume but V doping induces the shrinkage of cell volume due to the larger and smaller ionic radius of the Nb and V ions, respectively, compared to that of the Ti ion. We perform structural optimization of the intermediate phases of Na2+xM3O7 with increasing Na content x from 0 to 2, revealing that the overall relative volume expansion rate is slightly increased by Nb and V doping but remains lower than 3%. Our calculations demonstrate that the electrode potential of NTO is slightly raised and the specific capacity is reduced, but the electronic and ionic conductivities are improved by Nb or V doping. With the revealed understanding and mechanisms, our work will contribute to the search for advanced electrode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have gradually become one of the most promising energy storage techniques in the current era of post-lithium-ion batteries. For anodes, transitional metal selenides (TMSe) based materials are welcomed choices , owing to relatively higher specific capacities and enriched redox active sites. Nevertheless, current bottlenecks are blamed for their poor intrinsic electronic conductivities, and uncontrollable volume expansion during redox reactions. Given that, an interfacial-confined isochronous conversion strategy is proposed, to prepare orthorhombic/cubic biphasic TMSe heterostructure, namely CuSe/Cu3 VSe4 , through using MXene as the precursor, followed by Cu/Se dual anchorage. As-designed biphasic TMSe heterostructure endows unique hierarchical structure, which contains adequate insertion sites and diffusion spacing for Na ions, besides, the surficial pseudocapacitive storage behaviors can be also proceeded like 2D MXene. By further investigation on electronic structure, the theoretical calculations indicate that biphasic CuSe/Cu3 VSe4 anode exhibits well-enhanced properties, with smaller bandgap and thus greatly improves intrinsic poor conductivities. In addition, the dual redox centers can enhance the electrochemical Na ions storage abilities. As a result, the as-designed biphasic TMSe anode can deliver a reversible specific capacity of 576.8 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 , favorable Na affinity, and reduced diffusion barriers. This work discloses a synchronous solution toward demerits in conductivities and lifespan, which is inspiring for TMSe-based anode development in SIBs systems.",

The fluorinated carboxylate anode, disodium 2, 5-difluoroterephthalate (DFTP-Na), outperforms the other carboxylate anodes with H, Cl, and Br, in terms of high specific capacity (212 mA h g-1), long cycle life (300 cycles), and high rate capability (up to 5 A g-1). As evidenced by the experimental and computational results, the two F atoms in DFTP reduce the solubility, enhance the cyclic stability, and interact with Na+ during the redox reaction, resulting in a high-capacity and stable organic anode material in NIBs. Therefore, this work proves that fluorinating carboxylate compounds is an effective approach to developing high-performance organic anodes for stable and sustainable NIBs.",

        "abstract": "While cost‐effective sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) with crystalline silicon anodes promise high theoretical capacities, they perform poorly because silicon stores sodium ineffectively (capacity <40 mAh g−1). To address this issue, herein an atomic‐order structural‐design tactic is adopted for obtaining unique multilevel gradient‐ordered silicon (MGO‐Si) by simple electrochemical reconstruction. In situ‐formed short‐range‐, medium‐range‐, and long‐range‐ordered structures construct a stable MGO‐Si, which contributes to favorable Na–Si interaction and fast ion diffusion channels. These characteristics afford a high reversible capacity (352.7 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1) and stable cycling performance (95.2% capacity retention after 4000 cycles), exhibiting record values among those reported for pure silicon electrodes. Sodium storage of MGO‐Si involves an adsorption–intercalation mechanism, and a stepwise construction strategy of gradient‐ordered structure further improves the specific capacity (339.5 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1). Reconstructed Si/C composites show a high reversible capacity of 449.5 mAh g−1, significantly better than most carbonaceous anodes. The universality of this design principle is demonstrated for other inert or low‐capacity materials (micro‐Si, SiO2, SiC, graphite, and TiO2), boosting their capacities by 1.5–6 times that of pristine materials, thereby providing new solutions to facilitate sodium storage capability for better‐performing battery designs.",

When employed in a Na3V2(PO4)3 ‖ Sn‐Bi@C full cell configuration, it demonstrates exceptional capacity retention of 97.06% after 300 cycles at 1 A g−1, along with a high energy density of 251.2 W h kg−1.",

        "title": "Synergetic Strategy for the Fabrication of Self-Standing Distorted Carbon Nanofibers with Heteroatom Doping for Sodium-Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "Currently, the limited availability of lithium sources is escalating the cost of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Considering the fluctuating economics of LIBs, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have now drawn attention because sodium is an earth-abundant, low-cost element that exhibits similar chemistry to that of LIBs. Despite developments in different anode materials, there still remain several challenges in SIBs, including lighter cell design for SIBs. The presented work designs a facile strategy to prepare nitrogen-doped free-standing pseudo-graphitic nanofibers via electrospinning. A structural and morphological study implies highly disordered graphitic structured nanofibers having diameters of ∼120–170 nm, with a smooth surface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed that nitrogen was successfully doped in carbon nanofibers (CNFs). When served as an anode material for SIBs, the resultant material exhibits excellent sodium-ion storage properties in terms of long-term cycling stability and high rate capability. Notably, a binder-free self-standing CNF without a current collector was used as an anode for SIBs that delivered capacities of 210 and 87 mA h g–1 at 20 and 1600 mA g–1, respectively, retaining a capacity of 177 mA h g–1 when retained at 20 mA g–1. The as-synthesized CNFs demonstrate a long cycle life with a relatively high Columbic efficiency of 98.6% for the 900th cycle, with a stable and excellent rate capacity. The sodium storage mechanisms of the CNFs were examined with various nitrogen concentrations and carbonization temperatures. Furthermore, the diffusion coefficients of the sodium ions based on the electrochemical impedance spectra measurement have been calculated in the range of 10–15–10–12 cm2 s–1, revealing excellent diffusion mobility for Na atoms in the CNFs. This study demonstrates that optimum nitrogen doping and carbonization temperature demonstrated a lower Warburg coefficient and a higher Na-ion diffusion coefficient leads to enhanced stable electrochemical performance. Thus, our study shows that the nitrogen-doped CNFs will have potential for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Electrochemical performance of the layered compound CrPS4 for the usage as anode material in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) was examined and exceptional reversible long-term capacity and capacity retention were found. After 300 cycles, an extraordinary reversible capacity of 687 mAh g-1 at a current rate of 1 A g-1 was achieved, while rate capability tests showed an excellent capacity retention of 100%. Detailed evaluation of the data evidence a change of the electrochemical reaction upon cycling leading to the striking long-term performance. Further investigations targeted the reaction mechanism of the first cycle by applying complementary techniques, i.e., powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), pair distribution function (PDF) analysis, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and 23Na/31P magic-angle-spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The results indicated an unexpectedly complex reaction pathway including formation of several intercalation compounds, depending on the amount of Na inserted at the early discharge states and subsequent conversion to Na2S and strongly disordered metallic Cr at the completely discharged state. While XAS measurements suggest no further presence of intermediates after formation of Na intercalation compounds, several different phases are detected via MAS NMR upon continued discharging. Especially the data obtained from the MAS NMR investigations therefore point toward a very complex reaction pathway. Furthermore, solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation, resulting in the presence of NaF, was observed. After recharging the anode material, no structural long-range order occurred, but short-range order indeed resembled the local environment of the starting material, to a certain extent.",

        "abstract": "MnFe2O4 nanodots (∼3.3 nm) homogeneously dispersed in porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (denoted as MFO@C) were prepared by a feasible electrospinning technique. Meanwhile, MFO@C with the character of flexible free-standing membrane was directly used as binder- and current collector-free anode for sodium-ion batteries, exhibiting high electrochemical performance with high-rate capability (305 mA h g(-1) at 10000 mA g(-1) in comparison of 504 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1)) and ultralong cycling life (ca. 90% capacity retention after 4200 cycles). The Na-storage mechanism was systematically studied, revealing that MnFe2O4 is converted into metallic Mn and Fe after the first discharge (MnFe2O4 + 8Na(+) + 8e(-) → Mn + 2Fe + 4Na2O) and then to MnO and Fe2O3 during the following charge (Mn + 2Fe + 4Na2O → MnO + Fe2O3 + 8Na(+) + 8e(-)). The subsequent cycles occur through reversible redox reactions of MnO + Fe2O3 + 8Na(+) + 8e(-) ↔ Mn + 2Fe + 4Na2O, of which the reduction/oxidation of MnO/Mn takes place at a lower potential than that of Fe2O3/Fe. Furthermore, a soft package sodium-ion full battery with MFO@C anode and Na3V2(PO4)2F3/C cathode was assembled, delivering a stable capacity of ∼400 mA h g(-1) for MFO@C (with 100 cycles at 500 mA g(-1)) and a promising energy density of 77.8 Wh kg(-1) for the whole battery. This is owing to the distinctive structure of very-fine MnFe2O4 nanodots embedded in porous N-doped carbon nanofibers, which effectively improves the utilization rate of active materials, facilitates the transportation of electrons and Na(+) ions, and prevents the particle pulverization/agglomeration upon prolonged cycling.",

The electrochemical performances of sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles are studied as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. The galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements have been performed in a voltage range of 0.01-2.6 V vs. Na(+)/Na under different current densities, using the as-prepared sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles as a working electrode. Typically, the initial discharge and charge capacities of sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles are 475 and 380 mA h g(-1), respectively, at a current density of 20 mA g(-1). The sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles exhibit high capacity with a reversible discharge capacity of about 190 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles. It should be emphasized that the discharge reaction consists of two steps which correspond to voltage plateaus of 0.93 V and 0.85 V vs. Na(+)/Na in the first discharge curve of the Na/MoS2 battery, respectively. But there is only one apparent voltage plateau in the Na/Na-Mo-S battery, and it reduces to below 0.5 V vs. Na(+)/Na, which can enhance the power density. All of the findings demonstrate that sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles have steady cycling performance and environmental and cost friendliness as next generation secondary batteries.",

Herein, the micro/nanostructural Sb/graphene composite (Sb-O-G) is successfully prepared with the uniform Sb nanospheres (∼100 nm) bound on the graphene via oxygen bonds. It is revealed that the in-situ-constructed oxygen bonds play a significant role on enhancing Na-storage properties, especially the ultrafast charge/discharge capability. The oxygen-bond-enhanced Sb-O-G composite can deliver a high capacity of 220 mAh/g at an ultrahigh current density of 12 A/g, which is obviously superior to the similar Sb/G composite (130 mAh/g at 10 A/g) just without Sb-O-C bonds. It also exhibits the highest Na-storage capacity compared to Sb/G and pure Sb nanoparticles as well as the best cycling performance. More importantly, this Sb-O-G anode achieves ultrafast (120 C) energy storage in SIB full cells, which have already been shown to power a 26-bulb array and calculator. All of these superior performances originate from the structural stability of Sb-O-C bonds during Na uptake/release, which has been verified by ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies and infrared spectroscopies.",

        "abstract": "To design a high-performance sodium-ion battery (SIB) anode, binary zinc phosphides (ZnP2 and Zn3P2) were synthesized by a facile solid-state heat treatment process, and their Na storage characteristics were evaluated. The Na reactivity of ZnP2 was better than that of Zn3P2. Therefore, a C-modified ZnP2-based composite (ZnP2-C) was fabricated to achieve better electrochemical performance. To investigate the electrochemical reaction mechanism of ZnP2-C during sodiation/desodiaiton, various ex-situ analytical techniques were employed. During sodiation, ZnP2 in the composite was transformed into NaZn13 and Na3P phases, exhibiting a one-step conversion reaction. Conversely, Zn and P in the NaZn13 and the Na3P, respectively, were fully recombined to the original ZnP2 phase during desodiation. Owing to the one-step conversion/recombination of ZnP2 in the composite during cycling, ZnP2-C showed high electrochemical performance with a highly reversible capacity of 883 mAh g-1 after 130 cycles with no capacity deterioration and a fast C-rate capability of 500 mAh g-1 at 1C and 350 mAh g-1 at 3C.",

The major obstacle for the practical application of SIBs is the absence of suitable negative electrode materials with long cycling stability and high rate performance. Here, sulfur‐doped double‐shell sodium titanate (Na2Ti3O7) microspheres constructed from 2D ultrathin nanosheets are synthesized via a templating route combined with a low‐temperature sulfurization process. The resulting double‐shell microspheres deliver a high specific capacity (≈222 mAh g−1 at 1 C), excellent cycling stability (162 mAh g−1 after 15 000 cycles at 20 C), and superior rate capability (122 mAh g−1 at 50 C) as anode for SIBs. The improved electrochemical properties originate from synergistic effects between the unique double‐shell nanostructures built from 2D nanosheets architecture and sulfur doping. This synergistic effect not only stabilize Na2Ti3O7‐based electrode during the cycling, but also improve the sluggish Na insertion/extraction kinetics by narrowing the bandgap of Na2Ti3O7. The synthesis strategy proposed here can be developed into a technical rationale for generating high‐performance sodium‐storage devices.",

Herein, novel braided porous carbon fibres (BPCFs) are prepared using the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method. The BPCFs possess interwoven porous structures and abundant vacancies. The growth mechanism of the BPCFs can be attributed to the polycrystalline transformation of the nanoporous copper catalyst in the early stage of CVD process. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the Na+ adsorption energies of the mono‐vacancy edges of the BPCFs (−1.22 and −1.09 eV) are lower than that of an ideal graphene layer (−0.68 eV), clarifying in detail the adsorption‐dominated sodium storage mechanism. Hence, the BPCFs as an anode material present an outstanding discharge capacity of 401 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 500 cycles. Remarkably, this BPCFs anode, under high‐mass‐loading of 5 mg cm−2, shows excellent long‐term cycling ability with a reversible capacity of 201 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1 over 1000 cycles.

Herein, we propose a space-confinement strategy to remarkably promote the cycling stability and rate capacity by embedding FePS3 particles in the interlayer of expanded graphite (EG), which are derived from in situ transformation of graphite intercalation compounds. The layered EG not only greatly alleviates the volume fluctuations of FePS3 by the space confinement effect so as to maintain the stability of the electrode microstructure, but it also ensures rapid Na+ and electron transfer during cycling. When acting as an anode for SIBs, the hybrid electrode delivers a highly reversible capacity of 312.5 mAh g-1 at an ultrahigh rate of 50 A g-1 while retaining an ultralong life span of 1300 cycles with a retention of 82.4% at 10 A g-1.

The kinetic investigations and density functional theory reveal that the unique structure connected by interfacial bonds enhances Na+ transport rate and charge transfer efficiency, while carbon greatly mitigates the volume expansion. Unsurprisingly, the VS4-HCMSs exhibit an impressive first-cycle Coulombic efficiency of 91.31% and an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 612 mAh g-1 after 300 cycles at 0.5 A g-1, even exhibit the reversible capacity of 498.8 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 5 A g-1. Additionally, the NaFePO4//VS4-HCMSs full cell is cycled for 200 cycles at 0.2 C and powered the light-emitting diodes for up to 30 minutes afterward.

Herein, an \"embryo\" strategy is proposed for synthesis of nanorod-embedded MoO2 /MoS2 /C network nanoarchitecture as anode for SIBs with high-rate performance. Interestingly, L-cysteine which plays triple roles including sulfur source, reductant, and carbon source can be utilized to produce the sulfur vacancy-enriched heterostructure. Specifically, L-cysteine can combine with metastable monoclinic MoO3 nanorods at room temperature to encapsulate the \"nutrient\" of MoOx analogues (MoO2.5 (OH)0.5 and MoO3 ·0.5H2 O) and hydrogen-deficient L-cysteine in the \"embryo\" precursor affording for subsequent in situ multistep heating treatment.

        "abstract": "The development of 1D nanostructures with enhanced material properties has been an attractive endeavor for applications in energy and environmental fields, but it remains a major research challenge. Herein, this work demonstrates a simple, gel‐derived method to synthesize uniform 1D elongated sub‐nanotubes with an anatase/bronze TiO2 nanocrystal wall (TiO2 SNTs). The transformation mechanism of TiO2 SNTs is studied by various ex situ characterization techniques. The resulting 1D nanostructures exhibit, synchronously, a high aspect ratio, open tubular interior, and anatase/bronze nanocrystal TiO2 wall. This results in excellent properties of electron/ion transport and reaction kinetics. Consequently, as an anode material for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), the TiO2 SNTs display an ultrastable long‐life cycling stability with a capacity of 107 mAh g−1 at 16 C after 4000 cycles and a high‐rate capacity of 94 mAh g−1 at 32 C. This a high‐rate and long‐life performance is superior to any report on pure TiO2 for SIBs. This work provides new fundamental information for the design and fabrication of inorganic structures for energy and environmental applications.",

        "abstract": "Sodium ion battery is one of the promising rechargeable batteries due to the low-cost and abundant sodium sources. In this work, a monolithic sodium ion battery based on a Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 cathode, MoS2 layered anode, and polyether-based polymer electrolyte is reported. In addition, a new kind of polysulfonamide-supported poly(ethylene glycol) divinyl ether based polymer electrolyte is also demonstrated for monolithic sodium ion battery via in situ preparation. The resultant polymer electrolyte exhibits relatively high ionic conductivity (1.2 mS cm-1 ) at ambient temperature, wide electrochemical window (4.7 V), and favorable mechanical strength (25 MPa). Moreover, such a monolithic Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 /MoS2 sodium ion battery using this polymer electrolyte delivers outstanding rate capability (up to 10 C) and superior cyclic stability (84%) after 1000 cycles at 0.5 C. What is more essential, such a polymer electrolyte based soft-package monolithic sodium ion cell can still power a red light emitting diode lamp and run finite times without suffering from any internal short-circuit failures, even in the case of a bended and wrinkled state.

Nonetheless, the implementation of NIBs is seriously hindered because of their low rate capability and cycling stability. This is mainly because the large ionic size of Na+ can reduce the structural stability and cause sluggish reaction kinetics of electrode materials. Herein, three-dimensional nanoarchitectured coral-like CoSe2@N-doped carbon (CL-CoSe2@NC) was synthesized through solvothermal and selenizing techniques. As a result, CL-CoSe2@NC for NIBs at 2 A g-1 exhibits an ultrahigh specific capacity of 345.4 mA h g-1 after 2800 cycles and a superhigh initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 93.1%. Ex situ XRD, HRTEM, SAED and XPS were executed to study the crystal structure evolution between Na and CoSe2 during sodiation/de-sodiation processes. The aforementioned results indicate that the improved sodium storage property of CL-CoSe2@NC could be attributed to better electrode kinetics and a stable SEI film because of the 3D nanoarchitecture and the existence of the NC layer.",

As well, carbonaceous materials, as a crucial additive, can effectively ameliorate the ion/electron conductivity of integrated composites, realizing the fast ion transport and charge transfer. Here, motivated by the enhancement effect of carbon and heterojunction on conductivity, it is proposed that the CoSe2 /WSe2 heterojunction as inner core is coated by carbon outer shell and uniformly embedded in porous carbon nanosheets (denoted as CoSe2 /WSe2 @C/CNs), which is used as anode material for SIBs. Combining with density functional theoretical calculations, it is confirmed that the structure of heterojunction can introduce built-in electric-field, which can accelerate the transportation of Na+ and improve the conductivity of electrons. Moreover, the introduction of porous carbon nanosheets (CNs) can provide a channel for the transportation of Na+ and avoid the volume expansion during Na+ insertion and extraction process. As it is expected, CoSe2 /WSe2 @C/CNs anode displays ultrastable specific capacity of 501.9 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 over 200 cycles, and ultrahigh rate capacity of 625 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Magnesium molybdate (MgMoO4), which possesses synergistic features combining both hierarchical plate-like nanomaterials and porous architectures, has been successfully synthesized through a facile combustion synthesis at a low temperature. The hierarchical architecture is characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. The as-obtained MgMoO4 nanoplates showed a porous structure with a pore-size distribution ranging from 50 to 70 nm. This porosity provides an electron transport pathway and enhanced surface reaction kinetics. The binding energies measured for Mg 2p, Mo 3d, 3p and O 1s are consistent with the literature, and with the metal ions being present as M(ii) and M(vi) states, respectively. This indicates that the oxidation states of the metal cations are as expected. The electrochemical behaviour of MgMoO4 was investigated using aqueous (NaOH) and non-aqueous solvents (NaClO4 in EC : DMC : FEC) for supercapacitor and battery applications. The sodium-ion capacitor involves ion absorption and insertion into the MgMoO4 electrodes resulting in superior power and energy densities. However, the cycling stability was found to be stable only for an aqueous system. The formation of a solid electrolyte surface layer restricted the reversible capacity of the MgMoO4 in the sodium-battery. Nevertheless, it does offer some promise as an anode material for storing energy with high rate performance and excellent capacity retention. Detailed comparative analyses of various electrolytes in storage devices such as hybrid sodium-ion capacitors and sodium-ion batteries are vital for the integration of hierarchical structured materials into practical applications.

        "abstract": "Conversion electrodes, which can realize high capacities by employing the wider valence states of transition metals, are investigated for sodium storage and applied for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Importantly, this work is a first report for the sodium storage ability and related storage mechanism in oxalate compounds, specifically cobalt oxalate (CoC2O4) nanorods. The nanorods are intimately blended with acetylene black powders to achieve sufficient electrical conductivity (∼10-3 S cm-1). The resulting C-CoC2O4 electrode delivers an initial capacity of about 330 mA h (g-CoC2O4)-1 at a rate of 0.2 C (60 mA g-1) and preserves 75% of the initial capacity over 200 cycles. A high charge (oxidation) capacity, ∼111 mA h g-1, was achieved even at 30 C (9000 mA g-1). This remarkable electrode performance is reported for the first time for metal oxalate compounds tested for Na cells, to the best of our knowledge. X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy analyses lead to the proposal of a new sodium storage mechanism. For this mechanism, CoC2O4 is converted into Co metal involving with the creation of Na2C2O4 on discharge (reduction), and the Co metal is recovered to CoC2O4 on charge. The employed electroconducting carbon is likely to provide good electron conduction paths, which enables fast conversion on both discharge and charge. A full cell comprised of the C-CoC2O4 anode and carbon-coated NaCrO2 cathode exhibits good retention capacity over prolonged cycling, with retention of about 84.7% of the first capacity [107 mA h (g-NaCrO2)-1] for 300 cycles, and is active at a rate of 5 C (550 mA g-1), with a capacity of 79.5 mA h g-1.

However, high cost and low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of HC seriously limit its future commercialization for SIBs.

The microstructure evolution studied using X-ray diffraction, Raman, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, along with electrochemical measurements, reveals the optimal carbonization condition of the mangosteen shell: HC carbonized at 1500 °C for 2 h delivers the highest reversible capacity of ∼330 mA h g–1 at a current density of 20 mA g–1, a capacity retention of ∼98% after 100 cycles, and an ICE of ∼83%.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion hybrid capacitors are known for their high power densities and superior cycle-life compared to Na-ion batteries. However, low energy densities (˂ 100 Wh kg-1) due to the lack of high capacity (˃ 150 mAh g-1) anodes capable of fast-charging are delaying their practical implementation. Herein, we report a high-performance Na-ion hybrid capacitor based on interface engineered hierarchical TiO2 nanosheet anode consisting of bronze (~ 15%) and anatase (~ 85%) crystallites (~ 10 nm). This pseudocapacitive dual-phase anode demonstrated exceptional specific capacity of 289 mAh g-1@ 0.025 A g-1, and excellent rate capability (110 mAh g-1@ 1.0 A g-1). Na-ion hybrid capacitor integrating dual-phase hierarchical TiO2 nanosheet anode and activated carbon cathode exhibited a high energy density of 200 Wh kg-1 (based on the total mass of active materials in both electrodes) and power density of 6191 W kg-1. These values are in the energy and power density range of Li-ion batteries (100-300 Wh kg-1) and supercapacitors (5000-15000 W kg-1) respectively. Furthermore, exceptional capacity retention of 80% is observed after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. Outstanding electrochemical performance of the demonstrated Na-ion hybrid capacitor is credited to the enhanced pseudocapacitive Na-ion intercalation of two-dimensional TiO2 anode resulting from nanointerfaces between bronze and anatase crystallites. Mechanistic investigations evidenced Na-ion storage through intercalation pseudocapacitance with minimal structural changes. This approach of nanointerfaces induced pseudocapacitance presents great opportunities towards developing advanced electrode materials for next-generation Na-ion hybrid capacitors.",

        "abstract": "Anatase TiO2 is a promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high specific capacity, low cost, and excellent cycle stability. However, low electrical conductivity and poor Na+ ion transport in TiO2 limit its practical applications. Here, substantially boosted Na+ ion transport and charge transfer kinetics are demonstrated by constructing a near-ideal non-rectifying titanium carbonitride/nitrogen-doped TiO2 (TiCx N1- x /N-TiO2 ) heterostructure. Owing to the fast plasma effects and metastable hybrid phases, the TiCx N1- x is epitaxially grown on TiO2 . Energy band engineering at the interface induces high electron densities and a strong built-in electric field, which lowers the Na+ diffusion barrier by a factor of 1.7. As a result, the TiCx N1- x /N-TiO2 electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. The reversible specific capacities at rates of 0.1 and 10 C reach 312.3 and 173.7 mAh g-1 , respectively. After 600 cycles of charge and discharge at 10 C, the capacity retention rate is 98.7%. This work discovers an effective non-equilibrium plasma-enabled process to construct heterointerfaces that can enhance Na+ ion transport and provides generic guidelines for the design of heterostructures for a broader range of energy storage, separation, and other devices that rely on controlled ionic transport.",

However, the achievement of superior initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and high Na‐storage capacity via low‐temperature carbonization remains challenging due to the presence of tremendous defects with few closed pores. Here, a facile hybrid carbon framework design is proposed from the polystyrene precursor bearing distinct molecular bridges at a low pyrolysis temperature of 800°C via in situ fusion and embedding strategy. This is realized by integrating triazine‐ and carbonyl‐crosslinked polystyrene nanospheres during carbonization. The triazine crosslinking allows in situ fusion of spheres into layered carbon with low defects and abundant closed pores, which serves as a matrix for embedding the well‐retained carbon spheres with nanopores/defects derived from carbonyl crosslinking. Therefore, the hybrid hard carbon with intimate interface showcases synergistic Na ions storage behavior, showing an ICE of 70.2%, a high capacity of 279.3 mAh g−1, and long‐term 500 cycles, superior to carbons from the respective precursor and other reported carbons fabricated under the low carbonization temperature.

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) stands out as the most prospective anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) with significant potential for commercial applications. However, some long-standing and intractable obstacles, like low first coulombic efficiency (ICE), poor rate capability, storage capacity, and cycling stability, have severely hindered the conversion process from laboratory to commercialization. The above-mentioned issues are closely related to Na+ transfer kinetics, surface chemistry, and internal pseudo-graphitic carbon content. Herein, constructing molybdenum-modified hard carbon solid spheres (Mo2C/HC-5.0), both the ion transfer kinetics, surface chemistry, and internal pseudo-graphitic carbon content are comprehensively improved. Specifically, Mo2C/HC-5.0 with higher pseudo-graphitic carbon content provides a large number of active sites and a more stable layer structure, resulting in improved sodium storage capacity, rate performance, and cycling stability. Moreover, the lower defect density and specific surface area of Mo2C/HC-5.0 further enhance ICE and sodium storage capacity. Consequently, the Mo2C/HC-5.0 anode achieves a high capacity of 410.7 mA h g-1 and an ICE of 83.9% at 50 mA g-1. Furthermore, the material exhibits exceptional rate capability and cycling stability, maintaining a capacity of 202.8 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1 and 214.9 mA h g-1 after 800 cycles at 1 A g-1.",

However, it suffers from severe volume expansion during the sodiation-desodiation process. Encapsulating Sb into a carbon matrix can effectively buffer the volume change of Sb. However, the sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics in traditional carbon shells is still a bottleneck for achieving high-rate performance in Sb/C composite materials. Here we design and synthesize a yolk-shell Sb@Void@graphdiyne (GDY) nanobox (Sb@Void@GDY NB) anode for high-rate and long cycle life SIBs. The intrinsic in-plane cavities in GDY shells offer three-dimensional Na+ transporting channels, enabling fast Na+ diffusion through the GDY shells. Electrochemical kinetics analyses show that the Sb@Void@GDY NBs exhibit faster Na+ transport kinetics than traditional Sb@C NBs. In situ transmission electron microscopy analysis reveals that the hollow structure and the void space between Sb and GDY successfully accommodate the volume change of Sb during cycling, and the plastic GDY shell maintains the structural integrity of NBs. Benefiting from the above structural merits, the Sb@Void@GDY NBs exhibit excellent rate capability and extraordinary cycling stability.",

        "abstract": "Graphene/metal oxides (G/MO) composite materials have attracted much attention as the anode of sodium ion batteries (SIBs), because of the high theoretical capacity. However, most metal oxides operate based on the conversion mechanism and the alloying mechanism has changed to Na2O after the first cycle. The influence of G/Na2O (G/N) on the subsequent sodiation process has never been clearly elucidated. In this work, we report a systematic investigation on the G/N interface from both aspects of theoretical simulation and experiment characterization. By applied first-principles simulations, we find that the sluggish kinetics in the G/MO materials is mainly caused by the high diffusion barrier (0.51 eV) inside the Na2O bulk, while the G/N interface shows a much faster transport kinetics (0.25 eV) via unique double-interstitialcy mechanism. G/N interface possesses an interfacial storage of Na atom through the charge separation mechanism. The experimental evidence confirms that high interfacial ratio structure of G/N greatly improves the rate performance and endows G/MO materials the interfacial storage. Furthermore, the experimental investigation finds that the high interfacial ratio structure of G/N also benefits from the reversible reaction between SnO2 and Sn during cycling. Lastly, the effects of (N, O, S) doping in graphene systems at the G/N interface were also explored. This work provides a fundamental comprehension on the G/MO interface structure during the sodiation process, which is helpful to design energy storage materials with high rate performance and large capacity.",

In this work, the rational exploration for Co4S3 nanoparticles confined in an MnS nanorod-grafted N, S-codoped carbon polyhedron (Co-Mn-S@N-S-C) is achieved by the in situ growth of MOF on MnO2 nanorod along with the subsequent carbonization and sulfurization. Benefiting from the distinctive nanostructure, the Co-Mn-S@N-S-C anode delivers excellent structural stability, resulting in prolonged cycling stability with a capacity retention of 90.2% after 1000 cycles at 2 A g-1. Moreover, the reaction storage mechanism is clarified by the in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements.

        "abstract": "Designing multiphase composition is believed to availably boost the structural integrity and electrochemical properties of sodium-ion battery anodes. Herein, a conceive of nanoflowers, assembled with Bi2S3 nanorods, is demonstrated to construct the multiphase composition involving TiO2 coating and polypyrrole (PPy) encapsulation. Bi2S3 acted as the dominating active material, in consideration of the low content of TiO2, which ensured the high capacity of the composite. The dual-structural restrain of the TiO2 and PPy coatings can effectively alleviate volume variation based on the pseudo-\"zero-strain\" effect of TiO2 and high flexibility of PPy shells. Meanwhile, the heterointerface greatly enhanced the coupling effect between Bi2S3 and TiO2 and thus improved the electrochemical performance, which was proved by the results of density functional theory calculation and electrochemical tests. Combining the regulation from the Bi2S3/TiO2 heterojunction and the dual-structural restrain effect, the Bi2S3/TiO2@PPy electrode exhibited excellent rate performance and superior cycle stability (275.8 mA h g-1 over 500 cycles at 10 A g-1). This study indicates that designing multiphase composition can be very promising and provides a structural insight to construct high stability in electrodes for sodium-ion batteries.",

However, the accumulation of stress and strain upon sodium storage leads to the formation of cracks and fractures, resulting in electrode failure upon extended cycling. In this work, the design and construction of BixSb1−x bimetallic alloy films with a compositional gradient to mitigate the intrinsic structural instability is reported. In the gradient film, the top is rich in Sb, contributing to the capacity, while the bottom is rich in Bi, helping to reduce the stress in the interphase between the film and the substrate. Significantly, this gradient film affords a high reversible capacity of ≈500 mAh g−1 and sustains 82% of the initial capacity after 1000 cycles at 2 C, drastically outperforming the solid‐solution counterpart and many recently reported alloy anodes. Such a gradient design can open up the possibilities to engineering high‐capacity anode materials that are structurally unstable due to the huge volume variation upon energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion battery is emerging as a promising technology in the post-lithium-ion battery era to meet the high demand for portable energy storage devices. Custom-designed organic materials have been pursued as sustainable alternative electrodes for sodium-ion batteries, offering a solution that bypasses the need for traditional high-temperature synthesis. However, the challenge lies in achieving the desired electrochemical properties through precise structural modulation and the incorporation of redox-active functional groups. In this study, a triptycene-based microporous organic ladder polymer is developed featuring redox-active quinone moieties, designed as an anode material for high-performance sodium-ion batteries. The vertically aligned quinone moieties in the porous ladder polymer prevent the eclipsed stacking of layers, thereby enhancing the exposure of electroactive sites to electrolyte ions. Additionally, the ladder polymer exhibits almost unimodal pores due to its structural rigidity, facilitating fast Na+ ion diffusion. The redox-active quinone moieties host Na+ ions, and the microporosity supports capacitive ion storage. Consequently, a high reversible specific capacity of 316 mAh g-1 has been achieved. This study introduces a novel design strategy to develop redox-active microporous ladder polymers by carefully selecting organic building units for efficient Na+ ion storage.",

        "abstract": "Stabilizing the electrode interphases is urgently required to enhance the lifetime of high‐voltage sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, the continuous anode solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth associated with electron leakage and the fragile cathode–electrolyte interphase (CEI) lead to capacity fade at high voltage; and yet the solvation‐interphase‐performance relationship is inadequately addressed. Herein, a cooperative Na+‐solvation strategy is reported to stabilize the interphases by a holistic design of electrolytes combining soft and moderate co‐solvents. The rationally regulated Na+‐solvation leads to CEI/SEI with the desired thickness and component stability. As such, remarkable cycling stability is achieved for 4.3‐V Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) cathodes with 83.3% capacity retention over 3000 cycles at 1 C, significantly outperforming the carbonate counterpart (41.6% capacity retention). Meanwhile, the restrained SEI growth via reducing the formation of electron‐leaking Na2CO3 stabilizes the long‐term cycling of the hard carbon (HC) anode. The assembled NVOPF||HC full cells achieve superior rate capability (up to 15 C) and stable cycling stability over 500 cycles. The demonstrated engineering of electrolyte chemistry, Na+‐solvation, and interphase structure/component contributes toward the rational establishment of design rules for high‐voltage SIBs and possibly other similar chemistries.",

        "abstract": "Amorphous silicon (a-Si), due to its satisfactory theoretical capacity, moderate discharge potential, and abundant reserves, is treated as one of the most prospective materials for the anode of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the slow Na+ diffusion kinetics, poor electrical conductivity, and rupture-prone structures of a-Si restrict its further development. In this work, a composite (a-Si@rGO) consisting of porous amorphous silicon hollow nanoboxes (a-Si HNBs) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is prepared. The a-Si HNBs are synthesized through “sodiothermic reduction” of silica hollow nanoboxes at a relatively low temperature, and the rGO is covered on the surface of the a-Si HNBs by electrostatic interaction. The as-synthesized composite anode applying in SIBs exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 681.6 mAh g–1 at 100 mA g–1, great stability over 2000 cycles at 800 mA g–1, and superior rate performance (261.2, 176.8, 130.3, 98.4, and 73.3 mAh g–1 at 100, 400, 800, 1500, and 3000 mA g–1, respectively). The excellent electrochemical properties are ascribed to synergistic action of the porous hollow nanostructure of a-Si and the rGO coating. This research not only offers an innovative synthetic means for the development of a-Si in various fields but also provides a practicable idea for the design of other alloy-type anodes.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) offer several benefits, including cost-efficiency and fast-charging characteristics, positioning them as attractive substitutes for lithium-ion batteries in energy storage applications. However, the inferior capacity and cycling stability of electrodes in SIBs necessitate further enhancement due to sluggish reaction kinetics.

This work delves into the utilization of V1.13Se2/V2O3 heterostructure materials as anodes, initially fabricated via a simplified one-step solid-state sintering technique. The high pseudocapacitance and low characteristic relaxation time constant give the V1.13Se2/V2O3 heterostructure impressive properties, such as a high capacity of 328.5 mAh g-1 even after 1500 cycles at a high current density of 2 A g-1 and rate capability of 278.9 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1.

        "abstract": "Excellent structural stability, high operating voltage, and high capacity have made Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 )F 3   a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. However, high-temperature battery performances and heat generation measurements have not been systematically reported yet. Carbon-coated Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 )F 3  @MWCNT (multi-walled carbon nanotube) samples were fabricated by a hydrothermal-assisted sol-gel method and the electrochemical performances were evaluated at three different temperatures (25, 45, and 55°C). The well-crystallized Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 )F 3  @MWCNT samples exhibited good cycling stability at both low and high temperatures; they delivered an initial discharge capacity of 120-125 mAhg -1 at a 1C rate with a retention of 53% capacity after 1,400 cycles with 99% columbic efficiency. The half-cell delivered a capacity of 100 mAhg -1 even at a high rate of 10C at room temperature. Furthermore, the Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 )F 3  @MWCNT samples showed good long-term durability; the capacity loss was an average of 0.05% per cycle at a 1C rate at 55°C. Furthermore, ionic diffusivity and charge transfer resistance were evaluated as functions of state of charge, and they explained the high electrochemical performance of the Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 )F 3  @MWCNT samples. In-situ heat generation measurements revealed reversible results upon cycling due to the high structural stability of the material. Excellent electrochemical performances were also demonstrated in the full-cell configuration with hard carbon as well as antimony Sb/C anodes.",

        "abstract": "The natural insulating property and notorious pulverization of volume variation-induced materials during cycling pares the electrochemical activity of red phosphorous (RP) for lithium/sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs). To work out these issues, a tailored trimodal porous carbon support comprising highly ordered macropores and micro-mesoporous walls embedded with copper (Cu) nanoclusters (Cu-OMC) is proposed to confine RP. The construction of highly conductive copper-carbon wall facilitates fast electrons and ions transportation, while the interconnected and ordered porous structure not only creates enough space to resist the expansion effect of RP but also minimizes the ion diffusion length and enhances ion accessibility (the ion migration coefficient is ten times that of disordered porous carbon). Consequently, the resulting Cu-OMC@RP anode delivers a high reversible capacity (2498.7 mAh g-1 at 0.3 C for LIBs; 2454.2 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C for SIBs), superb rate properties (824.7 mAh g-1 at 10 C for LIBs; 774.2 mAh g-1 at 5 C for SIBs), and outstanding cycling stability (an ultralow decay rate of 0.057% per cycle after 1000 cycles at 10 C for LIBs and 0.048% per cycle at 5 C over 500 cycles for SIBs).",

        "abstract": "Developing efficient sodium-ion-storage mechanisms to increase the energy capacity in organic electrodes is a critical issue even after this period of prolonged effort. Uric acid (UA), a simple organic compound with three carbonyl groups is demonstrated to be electrochemically active in the insertion/extraction of Na ions. Theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations reveal that the sodium-ion storage by UA is a result of the stepwise mechanisms of p-π conjugation and the carbon anion. Aside from C═O, the functional group C═C(NH-)2 also provides an efficient Na-storage activated site in which the lone-pair electrons is stabilized through the planar-to-tetrahedral structural transition and low-energy orbital hybridization of N atoms. For further improvement of the electrochemical performance, a uric acid and carbon nanotube (UA@CNT) composite is prepared via a vacuum solution impregnation method. When employed as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries, the UA@CNT composite exhibits high specific capacity, excellent rate capability, and long cycling life even at high current densities. A reversible capacity of over 163 mA h g-1 is maintained even after 150 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g-1. The present study paves a way to develop reversible high-capacity organic electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries by a carbon-anion stabilization mechanism.",

        "abstract": "A sol-gel process followed by heat treatment derived a layered P2-type NaCoO2 cathode, which depicted unit cell parameters values of a = 2.8389 Å, c = 10.9899 Å, and V = 76.71 Å3 in powder X-ray diffraction pattern. The synthesized cathode exhibited hexagonal, 2D platelets with an ∼300 nm thickness. During the anodic and cathodic sweeps, the cyclic voltammograms revealed multiple redox peaks with the same current densities, shapes, and peak positions, associated with the highly reversible phase transition mechanism of the layered P2-type NaCoO2 cathode. The sodium cells yielded the capacities of 93/92 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C and 87/87 mAh g-1 at 1 C for the 50th charge-discharge cycles. The in situ multimode calorimetry (MMC) studies of sodium cells demonstrated a thermal explosion event, which occurred by sodium melting, short-circuit, electrode decomposition reaction, gas generation, exothermic reaction, released heat energy ,and cell gasket melting. Ultimately, the calculated released total heat energies of ∼550/740 J g-1 for in situ MMC studies and ∼312/594 J g-1 for ex situ DSC analyses (charge state at 4 V and discharge state at 2 V) show that the discharged state of sodiated layered P2-type NaCoO2 cathode material is more unsafe than the charge state. Furthermore, the ex situ differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) spectrum of a discharge state at 2 V of layered P2-type NaCoO2 revealed a decreased onset temperature (DOT) at 141 °C with two pronounced exothermic peaks at 197 and 266 °C with a released higher total heat energy of 594 J g-1 than the charge state heat energy at 312 J g-1, attributed to the higher charge onset temperature (COT) at 191 °C. Thus, the observed higher heat energy and decreased onset temperature for the discharge state at 2 V is associated with the higher Na+ ion in the discharge state of the layered P2-type NaxCoO2 cathode than that of the pristine cathode, showcasing that the layered P2-type NaCoO2 cathode is unsafe at the discharged condition for sodium-ion batteries.",

The as-obtained MCNO@DC nanofibers present superior sodium storage performance and retain an especially high specific capacity of 230 mAh g-1 with a large capacity retention of about 96% at 0.1 A g-1 after 500 cycles and a specific capacity of 107 mAh g-1 with capacity retention of about 89% at 1 A g-1 after 6500 cycles. The outstanding cycle characteristic is mainly due to the tiny MCNO nanoparticles, which shorten the ion migration distance, and the three-dimensional DC framework, which remarkably promotes the electronic transfer and efficiently limits the volume expansion during the progress of insertion and extraction of Na+ ions. Moreover, nitrogen doped in carbon is able to improve the electrochemical capability as well. Finally, kinetic analysis of the redox reactions is used to verify the pseudocapacitive mechanism in charge storage and the feasibility of using MCNO@DC composite nanofibers as an anode for sodium-ion batteries with the above-mentioned behavior.",

        "abstract": "Heteroatom doping is an effective method to improve the electrochemical properties of hard carbon anodes for sodium-ion batteries. However, the different roles of surface and bulk heteroatoms in Na storage have not been explored much. Herein, N, P dual-doped carbon nanofibers (NP-CNFs) with high doping contents and low surface area are designed to clarify the above issue. It is confirmed that P plays a more crucial role in Na storage compared with N. In addition, surface and bulk P not only possess different configurations but also show distinct Na storage activity. There are only oxidized POx groups on the surface, which are inactive for Na storage but promote the stability of electrochemistry interphase, while in the bulk phase, unoxidized P-C bonds also emerge except POx, which shows preeminently reversible Na storage activity, and the POx groups are activated simultaneously. Furthermore, P-doping changes the reactivity of N-configurations with Na both on the surface and in the bulk phase, exhibiting interesting synergism. As expected, the surface stability, bulk activity, and synergism enable NP-CNFs to achieve superior performance. It could deliver a prominent capacity of 105.6 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 after 3000 cycles in half cells and 164.3 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 200 cycles in full cells.",

However, the intrinsic tight lignocellulosic structure in biomass hinders the formation of sufficient closed pores, limiting the specific capacity of obtained hard carbons. In this contribution, a mild, industrially mature pretreatment method is utilized to selectively regulate biomass components. The hard carbon with a rich closed pore structure is prepared by optimizing the appropriate ratio of biomass composition. Optimized etching conditions enhanced the closed pore volume of hard carbon from 0.15 to 0.26 cm3 g-1. Consequently, the engineered hard carbon exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, including a high reversible capacity of 346 mAh g-1 with a high plateau capacity of 254 mAh g⁻¹ at 50 mA g⁻¹, robust rate capability, and cycling stability. The optimized hard carbon shows an 88 mAh g⁻¹ increase in plateau capacity compared to hard carbon from directly carbonizing bamboo fibers.

Therefore, polycrystalline Na‐β″‐alumina is employed as a SE model material to investigate the microstructural influence on sodium filament growth during deposition of sodium metal at the anode. The research focuses on the relationship between the microstructure, in particular grain boundary (GB) type and orientation, sodium filament growth, and sodium ion transport, utilizing in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements in combination with crystal orientation analysis. The effect of the anisotropic sodium ion transport at/across GBs depending on the orientation of the sodium ion transport planes and the applied electric field on the current distribution and the position of sodium filament growth is explored. The in situ TEM analysis is validated by large field of view post‐mortem secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS) analysis, in which sodium filament growth within voids and along grain boundaries is observed, contributing to the sodium network formation potentially leading to failure of batteries.",

The synthesized MA-VA-PcNi polymer is used as the anode for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries, exhibiting excellent energy storage behaviors. The MA-VA-PcNi/Li battery displays a high capacity of 610 mA h g-1 and can still remain at 507 mA h g-1 with a retention rate of 83.1% after 400 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g-1.

After nickel phthalocyanine (PcNi) was grafted onto the MA-VA polymer, aggregation between phthalocyanine rings was effectively prevented, and this exposes more active sites. At the same time, the spherical particles obtained by electrospinning technology further improve the dispersion and increase the number of active sites of the active materials.

The Bi0.75Sb0.25 arrays exhibit an appreciable electrochemical robustness for sodium storage, sustaining a reversible capability 335 mAh g-1 at a high rate of 2.5 A g-1, and 87% of the initial capacity over 2,000 cycles. We further demonstrate the applicability of the Bi0.75Sb0.25 array anode in sodium full cells by pairing it with a Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode. This full cell achieves a high specific energy of 203 Wh kg-1 (based on both active electrodes). Such an enhanced performance is attributed to the unique thorny-durian-like architecture and bimetallic alloy composition.

        "abstract": "Hard carbon is considered the most commercially viable anode material for sodium ion batteries due to its excellent sodium storage properties. However, the production cost of hard carbon is high, so optimizing the electrochemical performance of coal-derived hard carbon is adopted. However, due to the dense structure of coal, it is difficult to prepare closed pores inside the coal-derived hard carbon, which is not conducive to increasing capacity. Therefore, we propose Zn2(OH)2CO3 assisted ball milling pretreatment followed by carbonization to generate closed pores in coal-derived hard carbon. The reason for the formation of closed pores is that the uniform pores on the coal surface generated by the wear and etching of Zn2(OH)2CO3 are repaired at high temperatures. Via mechanism characterization, we verified that the plateau capacity is related to the filling of sodium ions in closed pores. Therefore, the as-prepared coal-derived hard carbon delivers a high capacity of 325.3 mA h g-1 (plateau capacity accounting for 45.1%) at a current density of 0.03 A g-1 with a capacity retention rate of 83.5% over 500 cycles.

While P anodes provide unparalleled capacities, the mechanism of sodiation and desodiation is not well-understood, limiting further optimization. Here, we use a combined experimental and theoretical approach to provide molecular-level insight into the (de)sodiation pathways in black P anodes for sodium-ion batteries. A determination of the P binding in these materials was achieved by comparing to structure models created via species swapping, ab initio random structure searching, and a genetic algorithm. During sodiation, analysis of 31P chemical shift anisotropies in NMR data reveals P helices and P at the end of chains as the primary structural components in amorphous Na xP phases. X-ray diffraction data in conjunction with variable field 23Na magic-angle spinning NMR support the formation of a new Na3P crystal structure (predicted using density-functional theory) on sodiation. During desodiation, P helices are re-formed in the amorphous intermediates, albeit with increased disorder, yet emphasizing the pervasive nature of this motif. The pristine material is not re-formed at the end of desodiation and may be linked to the irreversibility observed in the Na-P system.",

However, achieving quick charge and high power density is still a major challenge for most SIBs electrodes because of the sluggish sodiation kinetics. Herein, uniform and mesoporous NiS2 nanospheres are synthesized via a facile one-step polyvinylpyrrolidone assisted method. By controlling the voltage window, the mesoporous NiS2 nanospheres present excellent electrochemical performance in SIBs. It delivers a high reversible specific capacity of 692 mA h g-1 . The NiS2 anode also exhibits excellent high-rate capability (253 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1 ) and long-term cycling performance (319 mA h g-1 capacity remained even after 1000 cycles at 0.5 A g-1 ). A dominant pseudocapacitance contribution is identified and verified by kinetics analysis. In addition, the amorphization and conversion reactions during the electrochemical process of the mesoporous NiS2 nanospheres is also investigated by in situ X-ray diffraction. The impressive electrochemical performance reveals that the NiS2 offers great potential toward the development of next generation large scale energy storage.",

        "abstract": "The enhancement of the structural stability of conversion-based metal sulfides at high current densities remains a major challenge in realizing the practical application of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The instability of metal sulfides is caused by the large volume variation and sluggish reaction kinetics upon sodiation/desodiation. To overcome this, herein, a heterostructured nanocube anode composed of CuS/FeS2 embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon (CuS/FeS2 @NC) is synthesized. Size- and shape-controlled porous carbon nanocubes containing metallic nanoparticles are synthesized by the two-step pyrolysis of a bimetallic Prussian blue analog (PBA) precursor. The simple sulfurization-induced formation of highly conductive CuS along with FeS2 facilitates sodium-ion diffusion and enhances the redox reversibility upon cycling. The mesoporous carbon structure provides excellent electrolyte impregnation, efficient charge transport pathways, and good volume expansion buffering. The CuS/FeS2 @NC nanocube anode exhibits excellent sodium storage characteristics including high desodiation capacity (608 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 ), remarkable long-term cycle life (99.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 5 A g-1 ), and good rate capability up to 5 A g-1 . The simple, facile synthetic route combined with the rational design of bimetallic PBA nanostructures can be widely utilized in the development of conversion-based metal sulfides and other high-capacity anode materials for high-performance SIBs.",

The preferred anode material is hard carbon, because sodium cannot be inserted into graphite.

EP has been used to characterise LIBs; here, we demonstrate the first application of EP to any NIB material. The voltage versus sodiation fraction curves (voltage profiles) of hard carbon lack clear features, consisting only of a slope and a plateau, making it difficult to clarify the structural features of hard carbon that could optimise cell performance. We find additional features through EP that are masked in the voltage profiles. We fit lattice gas models of hard carbon sodiation to experimental EP and system enthalpy, obtaining: 1. a theoretical maximum capacity, 2. interlayer versus pore filled sodium with state of charge.",

        "abstract": "Biomass-derived hard carbon materials are attractive for sodium-ion batteries due to their abundance, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness. However, their widespread use is hindered by their limited specific capacity. Herein, a type of bamboo-derived hard carbon with adjustable pore structures is developed by employing a ball milling technique to modify the carbon chain length in the precursor. It is observed that the length of the carbon chain in the precursor can effectively control the rearrangement behavior of the carbon layers during the high-temperature carbonization process, resulting in diverse pore structures ranging from closed pores to open pores, which significantly impact the electrochemical properties. The optimized hard carbon with abundant closed pores exhibits a high specific capacity of 356 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1, surpassing that of bare hard carbon (243 mAh g-1) and hard carbon with abundant open pores (129 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1). However, the kinetic analysis reveals that hard carbon with open pores shows better sodium-ion diffusion kinetics, indicating that a balance between the closed and open pores should be considered. This research offers valuable insights into pore design and presents a promising approach for enhancing the performance of hard carbon anode materials derived from biomass precursors.",

However, the choice of suitable anode materials is a key step in the application of SIBs. Here, a simple vacuum filtration method is reported to obtain a bimetallic heterojunction structure.

The results show that the electron rich Se site and the internal electric field generated by the electron transfer in the heterojunction structure can provide rich electrochemically active areas and effectively promote the electron transport during sodiation/desodiation. More attractively, the strong interfacial interaction in the interface on the one hand maintains the stability of the structure and on the other hand promotes the diffusion of electrons. The NiCoSex/CG heterojunction with a strong oxygen bridge exhibits a high reversible capacity of 338 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, and an ignorable capacity attenuation at 2 A g-1 for 2000 cycles.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have attracted considerable attention in recent years. In order to promote the practical application of sodium-ion batteries, the electrochemical performances, such as specific capacity, reversibility, and rate capability of the anode materials, should be further improved. In this work, a Fe2O3/C composite with a well-ordered mesoporous structure is prepared via a facile co-impregnation method by using mesoporous silica SBA-15 as a hard template. When used as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries, the well-ordered mesoporous structure ensures fast mass transport kinetics. The presence of nano-sized Fe2O3 particles confined within the carbon walls significantly enhances the specific capacity of the composite. The carbon walls in the composite act not only as an active material contributing to the specific capacity, but also as a conductive matrix improving the cycling stability of Fe2O3 nanoparticles. As a result, the well-ordered mesoporous Fe2O3/C composite exhibits high specific capacity, excellent cycleability, and high rate capability. It is proposed that this simple co-impregnation method is applicable for the preparation of well-ordered mesoporous transition oxide/carbon composite electrode materials for high performance sodium-ion and lithium-ion batteries.",

        "title": "Microwave-Assisted Hydrothermal Synthesis of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 Nanocuboid@Reduced Graphene Oxide as an Ultrahigh-Rate and Superlong-Lifespan Cathode for Fast-Charging Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) has been regarded as a favorable cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high voltage and stable structure. However, the limited electronic conductivity restricts its rate performance. NVPF@reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was synthesized by a facile microwave-assisted hydrothermal approach with subsequent calcination to shorten the hydrothermal time. NVPF nanocuboids with sizes of 50-150 nm distributed on rGO can be obtained, delivering excellent electrochemical performance such as a longevity life (a high capacity retention of 85.6% after 7000 cycles at 10 C) and distinguished rate capability (116 mAh g-1 at 50 C with a short discharging/charging time of 1.2 min). The full battery with a Cu2Se anode represents a capacity of 116 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1. The introduction of rGO can augment the electronic conductivity and advance the Na+ diffusion speed, boosting the cycling and rate capability. Besides, the small lattice change (3.3%) and high structural reversibility during the phase transition process between Na3V2(PO4)2F3 and NaV2(PO4)2F3 testified by in situ X-ray diffraction are also advantageous for Na storage behavior. This work furnishes a simple method to synthesize polyanionic cathodes with ultrahigh rate and ultralong lifespan for fast-charging SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Electrolytes as an important part of sodium-ion batteries have a pivotal role for capacity, rate, and durability of electrode materials. On account of the high reduction activity of sodium metal with organic solvents, it is very important to optimize the electrolyte component to realize high stability on Na metal and hard carbon anodes. Herein, chemical and electrochemical stability of propylene carbonate (PC)-based electrolytes on sodium metal and hard carbon anodes is investigated systematically. The results demonstrate that whether using NaClO4 or NaPF6, the PC-based electrolytes are not stable on Na metal, but adding of FEC can immensely enhance the stability of the electrolyte because of the compact solid electrolyte interphase film formed. The electrolytes containing FEC also exhibit high electrochemical compatibility on hard carbon anodes, showing high reversible capacity and excellent cycling performance. A reaction mechanism based on the Na+ induction effect is proposed by spectrum and electrochemical measurements. This study can provide a new insight to optimize and develop stable PC-based electrolytes and be helpful for understanding the other electrolyte systems.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries, but the performance remains unsatisfactory and the sodiation mechanism in HC is one of the most debated topics. Here, from self-assembled cellulose nanocrystal sheets with crystallographic texture, unique HC nanosheets with vertically oriented (002) planes are fabricated and used as a model HC to investigate the sodiation mechanisms using synchrotron scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) coupled with analytical transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The model HC simplifies the 3D sodiation in a typical HC particle into a 2D sodiation, which facilitates the visualization of phase transformation at different states of charge. The results for the first time unveil that the sodiation in HC initiates heterogeneously, with multiple propagation fronts proceeding simultaneously, eventually merging into larger aggregates. The spatial correlation between the preferential adsorption and nucleation sites suggests that the heterogeneous nucleation is driven by the local Na-ion concentration, which is determined by defects or heteroatoms that have strong binding to Na ions. By identifying intercalation as the dominant sodium storage mechanism in the model HC, the findings highlight the importance of engineering the graphene layer orientation and the structural heterogeneity of edge sites to enhance the performances.",

Herein, we elaborately designed stable Sb-doped metallic 1T phase molybdenum sulfide (1T-MoS2-Sb) with a few-layered nanosheet structure via a simple calcination technique. The N-doping of the carbon and Sb-doping induce the formation of T-phase MoS2, which not only effectively enhances the entire stability of the structure, but also improves its cycling performance and stability. When employed as an anode of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), 1T-MoS2-Sb exhibits a reversible capacity of 493 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles and delivers prominent long-term performance (253 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 2200 cycles) along with decent rate capability.

        "abstract": "The design of sodium ion batteries is proposed based on the use of flexible membrane composed of ultrasmall transition metal oxides. In this paper, the preparation of CuO quantum dots (≈2 nm) delicately embedded in carbon nanofibers (denoted as 2-CuO@C) with a thin film via a feasible electrospinning method is reported. The CuO content can be controlled by altering the synthetic conditions and is optimized to 54 wt%. As binder-free anode for sodium ion batteries, 2-CuO@C delivers an initial reversible capacity of 528 mA h g-1 at the current density of 100 mA g-1 , an exceptional rate capability of 250 mA h g-1 at 5000 mA g-1 , and an ultra-stable capacity of 401 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 500 mA g-1 . The enhancement of electrochemical performance is attributed to the unique structure of 2-CuO@C, which offers a variety of advantages: highly conductive carbon matrix suppressing agglomeration of CuO grains, interconnected nanofibers ensuring short transport length for electrons, well-dispersed CuO quantum dots leading to highly utilization rate, and good mechanical properties resulting in strong electrode integrity.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are recognized as promising energy storage devices. However, they suffer from rapid capacity decay at ultra-low temperatures due to high Na+ desolvation energy barrier and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, a weakly solvating electrolyte (WSE) with decreased ion-dipole interactions is designed for stable sodium storage in hard carbon (HC) anode at ultra-low temperatures. 2-methyltetrahydrofuran with low solvating power is incorporated into tetrahydrofuran to regulate the interactions between Na+ and solvents. The reduced Na+-dipole interactions facilitate more anionic coordination in the first solvation sheath, which consistently maintains anion-enhanced solvation structures from room to low temperatures to promote inorganic-rich SEI formation. These enable WSE with a low freezing point of -83.3°C and faster Na+ desolvation kinetics. The HC anode thus affords reversible capacities of 243.2 and 205.4 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 at -40 and -60°C, respectively, and the full cell of HC||Na3V2(PO4)3 yields an extended lifespan over 250 cycles with high capacity retention of ~100% at -40°C. This work sheds new lights on the ion-dipole regulation for ultra-low temperature SIBs.",

A low-cost Na-K alloy is liquid at 25 °C from 9.2 to 58.2 wt% of sodium; sodium and/or potassium can be plated dendrite-free in the liquid range at room temperature. The co-existence of two alkali metals in an anode raises a question: whether the liquid Na-K alloy acts as a Na or a K anode. Here we show the alkali-metal that is stripped from the liquid Na-K anode is dependent on the preference of the cathode host. It acts as the anode of a sodium rechargeable cell if the cathode host structure selectively accepts only Na+ ions; as the anode of a potassium rechargeable cell if the cathode accepts K+ ions in preference to Na+ ions. This dual-anode behavior means the liquid Na-K alkali-alloy can be applied as a dendrite-free anode in Na-metal batteries as well as K-metal batteries.",

        "abstract": "The metal anode is the pivotal component for advanced sodium‐metal batteries such as Na–O2 batteries. Designing a 3D confinement scaffold is a promising strategy for constructing dendrite‐free sodium‐metal anodes; however, cycling stability at a large current density (>10 mA cm−2) is still difficult to realize. Herein, the design of new lightweight and fibrous hydroxylated Ti3C2 (h‐Ti3C2) MXene based scaffolds with stepped sodiophilic gradient structure (h‐M‐SSG) is reported, and its thickness can be controlled (80−250 µm). The sodiophilic gradient structure (adjusted by h‐Ti3C2) can effectively induce sodium ions to preferentially deposit at the bottom of the scaffold, thus inhibiting dendrite growth. h‐M‐SSG/Na‐based symmetrical batteries exhibit a low polarization voltage and long cycling life at a high current density (40 mA cm−2) and a high cut‐off capacity (40 mAh cm−2). Moreover, a Na–O2 battery with an h‐M‐SSG/Na anode exhibits a low potential gap of 0.137 V after 45 cycles at 1000 mA g−1 and 1000 mAh g−1. This deposition‐regulation strategy would inspire the design of 3D scaffolds for high‐performance sodium‐metal‐anode‐based batteries.",

        "abstract": "SnO2 has been considered as a promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium ion batteries (SIBs), but challenging as well for the low-reversible conversion reaction and coulombic efficiency. To address these issues, herein, SnO2 quantum dots (≈5 nm) embedded in porous N-doped carbon matrix (SnO2 /NC) are developed via a hydrothermal step combined with a self-polymerization process at room temperature. The ultrasmall size in quantum dots can greatly shorten the ion diffusion distance and lower the internal strain, improving the conversion reaction efficiency and coulombic efficiency. The rich mesopores/micropores and highly conductive N-doped carbon matrix can further enhance the overall conductivity and buffer effect of the composite. As a result, the optimized SnO2 /NC-2 composite for LIBs exhibits a high coulombic efficiency of 72.9%, a high discharge capacity of 1255.2 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles and a long life-span with a capacity of 753 mAh g-1 after 1500 cycles at 1 A g-1 . The SnO2 /NC-2 composite also displays excellent performance for SIBs, delivering a superior discharge capacity of 212.6 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 3000 cycles.

        "abstract": "Composite cathodes have attracted great attentions due to the integrated advantages of each pure structure. And the component ratio deserves a carefully modulation to further improve the corresponding electrochemical performance. Mn-based layer-tunnel hybrid composite became a focus in sodium ion batteries due to the supe-riority in high performance, low cost and non-toxicity. In the previous reports, the structure modulation was car-ried out via changing the synthesis condition, varying the transition metal element ratio, and different ion doping. And it is still challenging to explore a more feasible method to simplify the adjustment process. Herein, we intro-duced Mg2+ into Na sites or transition metal sites in Na0.6MnO2 and firstly discovered the doping-sites variation induced structure adjustment phenomenon. Specifically, Mg doping in transition metal sites could be beneficial for the growth of the P2-type structure while layer/tunnel component ratio decreased when locating Mg2+ in Na sites. The P2-O2 phase transformations could be effectively suppressed by locating Mg2+ in both sites could the in high voltage regions and thus improve cycling performance. The designed material, Na0.6Mn0.99Mg0.01O2, could attain a decent capacity of 100 mA h g-1 at 1000 mA g-1 and a satisfied retention of 76.6 % after 500 cycles. Ad-ditionally, ex situ XRD experiments verify the excellent structural stability of Mg-substituted samples during charge-discharge processes. Moreover, the Na0.6Mn0.99Mg0.01O2 also displays superior sodium-ion full-cell proper-ties when merged with hard carbon anode. Thus, this research may indicate a proper novel thread for designing high-performance composite electrodes.",

However, small molecular organic materials suffer from issues such as low conductivity and the high dissolution rate in electrolytes. Herein, a phthalocyanine derivative (TPcDS) with a large non-localized π-electron system, obtained through thermodynamic polymerization of 4-aminophthalonitrile (AP) monomers, is designed to address these issues. According to the density function theory calculation, six sodium ions can be attracted by one polymer molecule, indicating a high theoretical capacity of 375 mA h g-1 .

        "abstract": "Highly crystalline CuFeS2 containing earth-abundant and environmentally friendly elements prepared via a high-temperature synthesis exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance as an anode material in sodium-ion batteries. The initial specific capacity of 460 mAh g-1 increases to 512 mAh g-1 in the 150th cycle and then decreases to a still very high value of 444 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 in the remaining 550 cycles. Even for a large current density, a pronounced cycling stability is observed. Here, we demonstrate that combining the results of X-ray powder diffraction experiments, pair distribution function analysis, and 23Na NMR and Mössbauer spectroscopy investigations performed at different stages of discharging and charging processes allows elucidation of very complex reaction mechanisms. In the first step after uptake of 1 Na/CuFeS2, nanocrystalline NaCuFeS2 is formed as an intermediate phase, which surprisingly could be recovered during charging. On increasing the Na content, Cu+ is reduced to nanocrystalline Cu, while nanocrystalline Na2S and nanosized elemental Fe are formed in the discharged state. After charging, the main crystalline phase is NaCuFeS2. At the 150th cycle, the mechanisms clearly changed, and in the charged state, nanocrystalline CuxS phases are observed. At later stages of cycling, the mechanisms are altered again: NaF, Cu2S, and Cu7.2S4 appeared in the discharged state, while NaF and Cu5FeS4 are observed in the charged state. In contrast to a typical conversion reaction, nanocrystalline phases play the dominant role, which are responsible for the high reversible capacity and long-term stability.",

        "abstract": "To achieve high‐quality hard carbon nanofibers (HCNFs), and particularly flexible HCNFs films is the eternal pursuit from low‐cost coal pitch (CP). However, it is still trapped seriously by the inborn bottleneck of low‐softening‐point (LSP) characteristics of CP itself. Herein, an efficient Bi(NO3)3·5H2O‐assisted electrospinning‐carbonization methodology is creatively devised to obtain flexible HCNFs films directly from LSP CP. The essential roles of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and pre‐oxidation in constructing flexible films are rationally proposed. With further regulation in Bi(NO3)3·5H2O dosage and calcination temperatures, specific micro‐structures/morphologies of flexible HCNFs films are finely optimized. The optimum HCNFs‐1.2 film is endowed with robust structural flexibility/stability, high‐content active oxygen/nitrogen groups, abundant graphic microcrystalline zones of large interlayer spacing, and convenient ion‐diffusion channels. Thanks to such remarkable merits, HCNFs‐1.2 retains a large reversible capacity of 125.3 mAh g‒1 over 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g‒1, when evaluated as a self‐supporting film anode for sodium dual‐ion batteries (SDIBs). Furthermore, the HCNFs‐1.2‐based SDIBs deliver a specific capacity of 90.9 mAh g‒1 at 0.1 A g‒1, along with a capacity retention of 78.4% after 1500 cycles at 1.0 A g‒1. The insightful understanding here will provide meaningful guidance for rational design of advanced flexible film electrodes toward next‐generation SDIBs and beyond.",

        "title": "Enhancing the Initial Coulombic Efficiency of Sodium-Ion Batteries via Highly Active Na2 S as Presodiation Additive.",
        "abstract": "Recently, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have received considerable attention for large-scale energy storage applications. However, the low initial Coulombic efficiency of traditional SIBs severely impedes their further development. Here, a highly active Na2 S-based composite is employed as a self-sacrificial additive for sodium compensation in SIBs. The in situ synthesized Na2 S is wrapped in a carbon matrix with nanoscale particle size and good electrical conductivity, which helps it to achieve a significantly enhanced electrochemical activity as compare to commercial Na2 S. As a highly efficient presodiation additive, the proposed Na2 S/C composite can reach an initial charge capacity of 407 mAh g-1 . When 10 wt.% Na2 S/C additive is dispersed in the Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 cathode, and combined with a hard carbon anode, the full cell achieves 24.3% higher first discharge capacity, which corresponds to a 18.3% increase in the energy density from 117.2 to 138.6 Wh kg-1 . Meanwhile, it is found that the Na2 S additive does not generate additional gas during the initial charging process, and under an appropriate content, its reaction product has no adverse impact on the cycling stability and rate performance of SIBs. Overall, this work establishes Na2 S as a highly effective additive for the construction of advanced high-energy-density SIBs.",

        "title": "Heterogeneous Engineering Strategy Derived In Situ Carbon-Encased Nickel Selenides Enabling Superior LIBs/SIBs with High Thermal Safety.",
        "abstract": "Nowadays, the extended usage of lithium/sodium ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs) encounters nerve-wracking issues, including a lack of suitable reservoirs and high thermal runaway hazards. Although using TiO2 and Li4Ti5O12 has been confirmed to be effective in improving battery safety, their low theoretical capacities inevitably cause damage to the electrochemical performance of the battery. Achieving win-win results has become an urgent necessity. This study designed a metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived in situ carbon-coated metal selenide (Ni-Se@G@C) as the anode. When the current density is 0.1-0.3 A g-1, the initial capacity of LIBs reaches 993.2 mAh g-1, which increases to 1478.9 mAh g-1 after running 800 cycles. When running at 2 A g-1, the cell also offers a relatively high capacity of 458.3 mAh g-1 after 1500 cycles. After the replacement of graphite with Ni-Se@G@C, the self-heating temperature (T0) and thermal runaway triggering temperature (T1) of half and full cells are significantly increased. Meanwhile, the maximum thermal runaway temperature (T2) and maximal heating release rate (HRRmax) are significantly reduced. Of note, the usage of Ni-Se@G@C enables the battery with superior cycling and rate performance. When used in SIBs, the cell gives an initial discharge capacity of 624.9 mAh g-1, which still remains at 269.4 mAh g-1 after running 200 cycles at 1 A g-1. Notably, Ea of the Ni-Se@G@C cell is 5.6 times higher than that of the graphite cell, corroborating the promoted safety performance. This work provides a new paradigm for MOF-derived micro/nanostructures, enabling the battery with an excellent electrochemical and safety performance portfolio.",

        "abstract": "Na‐superionic‐conductor (NASICON)‐type cathodes (e.g., Na3V2(PO4)3) have attracted extensive attention due to their open and robust framework, fast Na+ mobility, and superior thermal stability. To commercialize sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), higher energy density and lower cost requirements are urgently needed for NASICON‐type cathodes. Herein, Na3.5V1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 (NVFP) is designed by an Fe‐substitution strategy, which not only reduces the exorbitant cost of vanadium, but also realizes high‐voltage multielectron reactions. The NVFP cathode can deliver extraordinary capacity (148.2 mAh g−1), and decent cycling durability up to 84% after 10 000 cycles at 100 C. In situ X‐ray diffraction and ex situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations reveal reversible structural evolution and redox processes (Fe2+/Fe3+, V3+/V4+, and V4+/V5+) during electrochemical reactions. The low ionic‐migration energy barrier and ideal Na+‐diffusion kinetics are elucidated by density functional theory calculations. Combined with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fe with unpaired electrons in the 3d orbital is inseparable from the higher‐valence redox activation. More competitively, coupling with a hard carbon (HC) anode, HC//NVFP full cells demonstrate high‐rate capability and long‐duration cycling lifespan (3000 stable cycles at 50 C), along with material‐level energy density up to 304 Wh kg−1. The present work can provide new perspectives to accelerate the commercialization of SIBs.",

The development of high-performance cathode and anode materials is a big challenge for SIBs. As is well known, TiNb2O7 (TNO) exhibits a high capacity of ∼250 mAh g-1 with excellent capacity retention as a Li-insertion anode for lithium-ion batteries, but it has rarely been discussed as an anode for SIBs. Here, we demonstrate ball-milled TiNb2O7 (BM-TNO) as an SIB anode, which provides an average voltage of ∼0.6 V and a reversible capacity of ∼180 mAh g-1 at a current density of 15 mA g-1, and presents excellent cyclability with 95% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 500 mA g-1.

        "abstract": "MoS2 is the most promising anode material for secondary battery with its unique 2D layered structure. However, the application of MoS2 is restricted by the poor electrical conductivity and sluggish ion diffusion. Herein, hollow nanotubes constructed with highly conductive 1T phase MoS2 nanosheets and polypyrrole (PPy) nanotubes are fabricated and used as anode materials for lithium‐ion batteries and sodium‐ion batteries. Remarkably, these hollow nanotubes show a high lithium‐specific capacity of 755.5 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and excellent sodium‐specific capacity of 503.3 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles. The enhanced electrochemical performance can be attributed to the rational design of unique 1D and 2D composite structure. First, the highly conductive 1T phase MoS2 2D nanosheets and hollow 1D PPy nanotube can effectively promote the charge transfer kinetics. However, the increased interlayer spacing of 1T phase MoS2 rapidly improves the insertion/extraction process of metal ions, and the vertical growth of MoS2 nanosheets on the surface of the PPy nanotubes also exposes more energy storage sites. This work provides a new idea for the preparation of MoS2‐based composite materials, and also proposes a reference for its application in the secondary battery.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the effect of electrical conductivity on the energy-storage characteristics of anode materials in sodium-ion batteries, covalent organic nanosheets (CONs) are hybridized with highly conductive graphene nanosheets (GNs) via two different optimized synthesis routes, i.e., reflux and solvothermal methods. The reflux-synthesized hybrid shows a well-overlapped 2D structure, while the solvothermally prepared hybrid forms a segregated phase in which the contact area between the CONs and GNs is reduced. These two hybrids synthesized by facile methods are fully characterized, and the results reveal that their energy-storage properties can be significantly improved by enhancing the electrical conductivity via the formation of a well-overlapped structure between CONs and GNs. The discharge capacity and rate capability of the reflux-synthesized hybrid was considerably larger than that of the bare CONs, highlighting that the improvement in the charge-carrier transport properties can improve the accessibility of Na ions to the surface of the hybrids. This synthetic methodology can be extended to the fabrication of high-performance anodes for Na-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Iron sulfides with high theoretical capacity confront the challenges of low rate capability and severe capacity fading for sodium storage, which are mainly caused by poor electron/ion transport kinetics and drastic volume fluctuations during cycling. Herein, to mitigate these obstacles, a multi-step synthetic tactic involving solvothermal, carbonization, and subsequent sulfurization is put forward for the construction of wire-like structure by confining Fe7S8 particles in porous N-doped carbon framework (denoted as Fe7S8/PNC) using zinc iron nitrilotriacetate as template.

Then, Co1-xS, Co1-xS/C (ultrafine Co1-xS nanoparticles embedded in the shells of the nitrogen-doped porous carbon hollow nanosphere), and Co1-xS@C (Co1-xS nanoparticles entirely covered by an external amorphous carbon layer) were selectively fabricated via direct calcination or PPy coating & calcination of the obtained precursor.

Besides the excellent rate performance, a high reversible discharge capacity of 320 mA g-1 can be retained after 130 cycles at 1 A g-1. The impressive performance may be attributed to the unique structure, higher conductivity, and more active sites of Co1-xS/C.

        "abstract": "Rational construction of nanosized anode nanomaterials is crucial to enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium-/sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs). Various anode nanoparticles are created mainly via templating surface confinement, or encapsulation within precursors (such as metal-organic frameworks). Herein, low-content SnO2 nanodots on N-doped reduced graphene oxide (SnO2@N-rGO) were prepared as anode nanomaterials for LIBs and SIBs, via a distinctive lattice confinement of a CoAlSn-layered double hydroxide (CoAlSn-LDH) precursor. The SnO2@N-rGO composite exhibits the advantagous features of low-content (17.9 wt%) and uniform SnO2 nanodots (3.0 ± 0.5 nm) resulting from the lattice confinement of the Co and Al species to the surrounded Sn within the same crystalline layer, and high-content conductive rGO. The SnO2@N-rGO composite delivers a highly reversible capacity of 1146.2 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 for LIBs, and 387 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 for SIBs, outperforming N-rGO. Furthermore, the dominant capacitive contribution and the rapid electronic and ionic transfer, as well as small volume variation, all give rise to the enhancement. Precursor-based lattice confinement could thus be an effective strategy for designing and preparing uniform nanodots as anode nanomaterials for electrochemical energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Metallic selenides have been widely investigated as promising electrode materials for metal-ion batteries based on their relatively high theoretical capacity. However, rapid capacity decay and structural collapse resulting from the larger-sized Na+ /K+ greatly hamper their application. Herein, a bimetallic selenide (MoSe2 /CoSe2 ) encapsulated in nitrogen, sulfur-codoped hollow carbon nanospheres interconnected reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (rGO@MCSe) are successfully designed as advanced anode materials for Na/K-ion batteries. As expected, the significant pseudocapacitive charge storage behavior substantially contributes to superior rate capability. Specifically, it achieves a high reversible specific capacity of 311 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 in NIBs and 310 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 in KIBs. A combination of ex situ X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy tests reveals the phase transition of rGO@MCSe in NIBs/KIBs. Unexpectedly, they show quite different Na+ /K+ insertion/extraction reaction mechanisms for both cells, maybe due to more sluggish K+ diffusion kinetics than that of Na+ . More significantly, it shows excellent energy storage properties in Na/K-ion full cells when coupled with Na3 V2 (PO4 )2 O2 F and PTCDA@450 °C cathodes. This work offers an advanced electrode construction guidance for the development of high-performance energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "Sluggish reaction kinetics induced by the inferior solid-state ion diffusion and poor conductivity of electrode materials currently conflict with increasing fast-charge needs for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) based on conversion mechanism. Herein, mesoporous, conductive, thin-wall three-dimension (3D) skeletons of molybdenum nitride (meso-Mo2N) were established and employed as anodes to facilitate rate performance for SIBs. Mesoporous channels (～9.3 nm) with very thin walls (＜8 nm) and conductive networks in meso-Mo2N enable the rapid Na+/Li+ infiltrability/diffusivity and smooth electron transfer, respectively. The fast ion diffusion/transfer ability is confirmed by galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, cyclic voltammetry tests with higher ion-diffusion dominated capacity and larger Na+ diffusion coefficient. Consequently, meso-Mo2N exhibited a superior rate capability and a stable specific capacity of 158 mAh g-1 (after 1000 cycles) at 1 A g-1 for SIBs, surpassing nonporous Mo2N and even the previously reported Mo2N. Furthermore, the proof of concept can be also extended to enhanced Li storage. Such mesostructured design with 3D mesoporous, conductive thin wall of electrodes is a promising strategy for achieving fast-charging and high-performance Na/Li storage.",

Herein, porous Bi@C (P-Bi@C) microspheres consisting of self-assembled Bi nanosheets and carbon shells were constructed via a hydrothermal method combined with a carbothermic reduction. The optimized P-Bi@C-700 (annealed at 700 °C) demonstrates 359.8 mAh g-1 after 1500 cycles at 1 A g-1. In situ/ex situ characterization and density functional theory calculations verified that this P-Bi@C-700 relieves the volume expansion, facilitates Na+/electron transport, and possesses an alloying-type storage mechanism. Notably, P-Bi@C-700 also achieved 360.8 and 370.3 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 under 0 and 60 °C conditions, respectively. Na3V2(PO4)3//P-Bi@C-700 exhibits a capacity of 359.7 mAh g-1 after 260 cycles at 1 A g-1.

        "abstract": "Hard carbons (HCs), while a leading candidate for sodium-ion battery (SIB) anode materials, face challenges in their unfavorable sodiation kinetics since the intricate microstructure of HCs complicates the Na+ diffusion channel. Herein, a Hovenia dulcis-derived HC realizes a markedly enhanced high-rate performance in virtue of dual-functionalized Ca. The interlayer doped Ca2+ effectively enlarges the interlayer spacing, while the in situ-formed CaSe templates induce the formation of hierarchical pore structures and intrinsic defects, significantly providing fast Na+ diffusion channels and abundant active sites and thus enhancing the sodium storage kinetics. Achieved by the synergistic effect of regulation of intrinsic microcrystalline and pore structures, the optimized HC shows remarkable performance enhancements, including a high reversible capacity of 350.3 mA h g-1 after 50 cycles at 50 mA g-1, a high-capacity retention rate of 95.3% after 1000 cycles, and excellent rate performance (108.4 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1).

        "abstract": "Metallic phase 1T‐MoS2 is considered a prospective anode material for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) due to its remarkable electrical conductivity and unique layered structure. However, 1T‐MoS2 is thermodynamically unstable and prone to phase transition to the 2H‐MoS2 phase. Herein, self‐supporting nitrogen‐doped and carbon‐coated 1T/2H mixed‐phase MoS2 nanosheets with rich sulfur vacancies on carbon cloth (C@N‐MoS2‐p/CC) are synthesized through a hydrothermal method and Ar/NH3 radio‐frequency (RF) plasma treatment process. Density‐functional‐theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that after Ar/NH3 RF plasma treatment, nitrogen‐doping and etching effects are realized, which combine with carbon‐coating significantly reduce the phase transition energy of 1T‐MoS2, thus triggering the phase transition and enabling the stable existence of the highly active 1T‐MoS2. As a result, the C@N‐MoS2‐p/CC exhibits outstanding sodium storage performance, with initial charge–discharge capacities of 701.0/797.0 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1, respectively. It also demonstrates exceptional rate capabilities and ultra‐high cyclic stability, maintaining a discharge capacity of 404.2 mAh g−1 after 910 cycles at a high rate of 2 A g−1. In a full cell with Na3V2(PO4)3/CC cathode, it exhibits excellent initial charge–discharge capacities of 102.3/102.9 mAh g−1 and maintains satisfactory cycling stability after 350 cycles (86.7 mAh g−1) at 0.1 C.",

        "abstract": "Lignin-derived porous carbons have great potential for energy storage applications. However, their traditional synthesis requires highly corrosive activating agents in order to produce porous structures. In this work, an environmentally friendly and unique method has been developed for preparing lignin-based 3D spherical porous carbons (LSPCs). Dropwise injection of a lignin solution containing PVA sacrificial templates into liquid nitrogen produces tiny spheres that are lyophilized and carbonized to produce LSPCs. Most of the synthesized samples possess excellent specific surface areas (426.6–790.5 m2/g) along with hierarchical micro- and mesoporous morphologies. When tested in supercapacitor applications, LSPC-28 demonstrates a superior specific capacitance of 102.3 F/g at 0.5 A/g, excellent rate capability with 70.3% capacitance retention at 20 A/g, and a commendable energy density of 2.1 Wh/kg at 250 W/kg. These materials (LSPC-46) also show promising performance as an anode material in sodium-ion batteries with high reversible capacity (110 mAh g–1 at 100 mA g–1), high Coulombic efficiency, and excellent cycling stability. This novel and green technique is anticipated to facilitate the scalability of lignin-based porous carbons and open a range of research opportunities for energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "The binder's choice holds immense significance in the quest for robust electrochemical performances of lithium/sodium‐ion battery's (LIB/SIB) electrodes. Conventional PVDF binder is a passive polymer lacking the ability to transport Li+/Na+ and facilitate ion kinetics. This limitation poses constraints in achieving high specific capacity, fast charging, and long cycle life. Herein, a novel water‐soluble concentrated imidazolium functionalized poly(ionic liquid), poly(oxycarbonylmethylene 1‐allyl‐3‐methyimidazolium) (PMAI) is synthesized, and evaluated it as binder in LIB/SIB. PMAI‐based anodic‐half cell exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, achieving higher capacities (297 mAhg−1 at 1C for LIBs and 250 mAhg−1 at 60 mAg−1 for SIBs) and good cycle stability (80 % capacity retention after 750 cycles for LIBs; 96% capacity retention after 200 cycles for SIBs), compared to PVDF binder. In addition, PMAI/Gr delivers a higher discharge capacity of 85 mAhg−1 than PVDF/Gr with 47 mAhg−1 at 5C. PMAI‐containing electrodes show better rate capability at different current densities than PVDF binder in LIB/SIB. The enhanced ion diffusion coefficient, lower resistance and decreased activation energy of desolvation, are ascribed to densely polar ionic liquid groups along the polymer and formation of a functionalized SEI via binder reduction. The novel PMAI binder's design and full‐cell examination confirm its potential in secondary‐ion battery applications.",

Via such a unique design, porous and bare structures can thoroughly expose the electroactive surfaces to the electrolyte, which is favorable for ultrafast sodium‐ion storage. In addition, the CFC provides an interconnected 3D conductive network to ensure firm electrical connection of the electrode materials. Besides the inherent flexibility of the CFC, the integration of the hierarchical structures of CoxP with the CFC, as well as the strong synergistic effect between them, effectively help to buffer the mechanical stress caused by repeated sodiation/desodiation, thereby guaranteeing the structural integrity of the overall electrode. Consequently, CoxP@CFC as an anode shows a record‐high capacity of 279 mAh g−1 at 5.0 A g−1 with almost no capacity attenuation after 9000 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Featuring a high theoretical capacity, low cost, and abundant resources, sodium metal has emerged as an ideal anode material for sodium ion batteries. However, the real feasibility of sodium metal anodes is still hampered by the uncontrolled sodium dendrite problems. Herein, an artificial three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical porous sodiophilic V2CTx/rGO-CNT microgrid aerogel is fabricated by a direct-ink writing 3D printing technology and further adopted as the matrix of Na metal to deliver a Na@V2CTx/rGO-CNT sodium metal anode. Upon cycling, the V2CTx/rGO-CNT electrode can yield a superior cycling life of more than 3000 h (2 mA cm-2, 10 mAh cm-2) with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.54%. More attractively, it can even sustain a stable operation over 900 h at 5 mA cm-2 with an ultrahigh areal capacity of 50 mAh cm-2. In situ and ex situ characterizations and density functional theory simulation analyses prove that V2CTx with abundant sodiophilic functional groups can effectively guide the sodium metal nucleation and uniform deposition, thus enabling a dendrite-free morphology. Moreover, a full cell pairing a Na@V2CTx/rGO-CNT anode with a Na3V2(PO4)3@C-rGO cathode can deliver a high reversible capacity of 86.27 mAh g-1 after 400 cycles at 100 mA g-1.

        "abstract": "The shortage of high-capacity anode materials with long cycling stability is the main roadblock to the development of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The advantages of transition metal selenides are high theoretical capacity, safety and ease of design, which gradually make them potential substitute materials for the anodes of a new generation of SIBs. However, the low intrinsic conductivity of transition metal selenides and the serious powderization during charge and discharge processes restrict their rate performance and cycling stability in SIBs. Herein, bimetallic selenide ZnSe/MoSe2@NC is fabricated by in situ selenation of a rhombic dodecahedron structured metal-organic framework (MOF) containing Zn/Mo salt. Such a heterojunction and structural regulation effectively promote sodium ion transportation. Furthermore, the porous and hierarchical ZnSe/MoSe2@NC is capable of adapting to the volume stress generated by sodium ion (de)insertion. Specifically, in SIB half-cell measurement, a comparable capacity of 401.8 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 1 A g-1 can be achieved by ZnSe/MoSe2@NC. Additionally, the ZnSe/MoSe2@NC polyhedron delivers a high capacity of 345.7 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1 (1500 cycles). Electrochemical kinetics analysis is performed in detail. In SIB full battery applications, the cell shows an impressive energy density of 175.1 W h kg-1. This research broadens the development prospect of transition metal selenides as anodes in SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The significance of exploring optimal electrode materials cannot be overstated, particularly in mitigating the critical issues posed by sluggish redox kinetics, significant volume variations, and severe structural collapse resulting from the insertion and extraction of sodium ions. These efforts are crucial for enhancing the longevity and rapid charging capabilities of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a defect engineering strategy for the in situ encapsulation of single‐phase ternary iron phosphoselenide into porous carbon by robust chemical bonds with the formation of rod‐like multicavity nanohybrids (FePSe3@C) is presented. The incorporation of Se atom not only modulates the electronic structure of the central metal Fe atom and enhances the intrinsic electrical conductivity, but also generates numerous additional reaction sites and accelerates the reaction kinetics of FePSe3@C, as corroborated by theoretical calculations and kinetic analysis. Notably, the FePSe3@C demonstrates an outstanding rate capability of 321.7 mAh g−1 even at 20 A g−1 and long cycling stability over 1000 cycles. The sodium‐ion full cell, pairing the FePSe3@C anode with the Na3V2(PO4)3@C cathode, exhibits a remarkable energy density of 202 Wh kg−1, demonstrating its practical applicability. This work provides a controllable defect and morphology engineering strategy to construct advanced materials with fast charge transfer for high‐power/energy SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium metal has become one of the most promising anodes for next‐generation cheap and high‐energy‐density metal batteries; however, challenges caused by the uncontrollable sodium dendrite growth and fragile solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) restrict their large‐scale practical applications in low‐cost and wide‐voltage‐window carbonate electrolytes. Herein, a novel multifunctional separator with lightweight and high thinness is proposed, assembled by the cobalt‐based metal–organic framework nanowires (Co‐NWS), to replace the widely applied thick and heavy glass fiber separator. Benefitting from its abundant sodiophilic functional groups and densely stacked nanowires, Co‐NWS not only exhibits outstanding electrolyte wettability and effectively induces uniform Na+ ion flux as a strong ion redistributor but also favors constructing the robust N,F‐rich SEI layer. Satisfactorily, with 10 µL carbonate electrolyte, a Na|Co‐NWS|Cu half‐cell delivers stable cycling (over 260 cycles) with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 98%, and the symmetric cell shows a long cycle life of more than 500 h. Remarkably, the full cell shows a long‐term life span (over 1500 cycles with 92% capacity retention) at high current density in the carbonate electrolyte. This work opens up a strategy for developing dendrite‐free, low‐cost, and long‐life‐span sodium metal batteries in carbonate‐based electrolytes.",

In this work, N-modified carbon-coated sodium titanium phosphate (NTPGN) composites were prepared by the sol-gel method by using sodium glutamate as a source of nitrogen and partial carbons. The addition of sodium glutamate forms a loose structure of nano-spherical flowers on the surface of sodium titanium phosphate, which shows a higher specific capacity, better rate performance, and excellent cycling performance compared to the carbon-coated titanium phosphate derived only from citric acid.

        "abstract": "Heterostructure construction with mixed transition metal sulfides has been recognized as a promising strategy to boost the performance of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a carbon-decorated MoS2/CoS heterostructure on carbon cloth (MoS2/CoS@CC) as a free-standing anode for SIBs was synthesized via a facile growth-carbonization strategy. In the composite, the generated built-in electric field at MoS2 and CoS heterointerfaces is beneficial for elevating the electron conductivity, thus expediting the Na-ion transport rate. Moreover, different redox potentials between MoS2 and CoS can effectively mitigate the mechanical strain induced by repeated Na+ de-/intercalation, thus ensuring the structural integrity. In addition, the carbon skeleton derived from the carbonization of glucose can enhance the conductivity of the electrode and maintain the structural integrity. Consequently, the resulting MoS2/CoS@CC electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 605 mA h g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 after 100 cycles, and prominent rate performance (366 mA h g-1 at 8.0 A g-1). Theoretical calculations also confirm that the establishment of a MoS2/CoS heterojunction can powerfully promote the electron conductivity, thereby enhancing the Na-ion diffusion kinetics.",

It has been demonstrated that for HC anodes improved electrochemical performance, e.g., increase in coulombic efficiency (CE) and improved rate performance have been achieved in ether‐based electrolytes. Here, we investigate spray‐coated HC composite electrodes charged at low and high current rates in 1 M sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) in diglyme using half‐cell experiments.

In 1 M NaPF6 ether‐based electrolyte, the spray‐coated HC composite electrodes reached a discharge capacity of 431 mA h g−1 at 0.1C that stays constant for 40 cycles, which is substantially higher than that obtained in carbonate‐based electrolytes. We investigated the formed interphase using scanning (electrochemical) probe microscopy (S(E)PM), X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time‐of‐flight secondary‐ion mass spectrometry (ToF‐SIMS), revealing distinct differences for longer cycling and at varying current rates which indicates that the properties of the formed SEI layers are influenced by the formation conditions.",

        "abstract": "We report an effective approach of utilizing multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as an active anode material in sodium ion batteries by expanding the interlayer distance in a few outer layers of multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The performance enhancement was investigated using a density functional tight binding (DFTB) molecular dynamics simulation. It is found that a sodium atom forms a stable bonding with the partially expanded MWCNT (PECNT) with the binding energy of -1.50 eV based on the density functional theory calculation with van der Waals correction, where a sodium atom is caged between the two carbon hexagons in the two consecutive MWCNTs. Wave function and charge density analyses show that this binding is physisorption in nature. This larger exothermic nature of binding energy favors the stable bonding between the PECNT and a sodium atom, and thereby, it helps to enhance the electrochemical performance. In the experimental works, partial opening of the MWCNT with the expanded interlayer has been designed by the well-known Hummer's method. It has been found that the introduction of functional groups causes a partial opening of the outer few layers of a MWCNT, with the inner core remaining undisturbed. The enhanced performance is due to an expanded interlayer of carbon nanotubes, which provide sufficient active sites for the sodium ions to adsorb as well as to intercalate into the carbon structure. The PECNT shows a high specific capacity of 510 mAh g-1 at a current density of 20 mA g-1, which is about 2.3 times the specific capacity obtained for a pristine MWCNT at the same current density. This specific capacity is higher when compared to other carbon-based materials. The PECNT also shows a satisfactory cyclic stability at a current density of 200 mA g-1 for 100 cycles. Based on our experimental and theoretical results, an alternative perspective for the storage of sodium ions in MWCNTs is proposed.",

        "abstract": "Electrochemical conversion reactions of metal oxides provide a new avenue to build high capacity anodes for sodium-ion batteries. However, the poor rate performance and cyclability of these conversion anodes remain a significant challenge for Na-ion battery applications because most of the conversion anodes suffer from sluggish kinetics and irreversible structural change during cycles. In this paper, we report an Fe2O3 single crystallites/reduced graphene oxide composite (Fe2O3/rGO), where the Fe2O3 single crystallites with a particle size of ∼300 nm were uniformly anchored on the rGO nanosheets, which provide a highly conductive framework to facilitate electron transport and a flexible matrix to buffer the volume change of the material during cycling. This Fe2O3/rGO composite anode shows a very high reversible capacity of 610 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1, a high Coulombic efficiency of 71% at the first cycle, and a strong cyclability with 82% capacity retention after 100 cycles, suggesting a potential feasibility for sodium-ion batteries. More significantly, the present work clearly illustrates that an electrochemical conversion anode can be made with high capacity utilization, strong rate capability, and stable cyclability through appropriately tailoring the lattice structure, particle size, and electronic conduction channels for a simple transition-metal oxide, thus offering abundant selections for development of low-cost and high-performance Na-storage electrodes.",

However, transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) anodes show unsatisfactory Na+ electrochemical performance owing to the low intrinsic conductivity and inferior ion transport kinetics. Here, an elaborate design is developed to prepare a composite of WSSe nanosheets supported on a 3D cross-networked porous carbon skeleton (WSSe@CPCS), which possesses en-rich anion vacancies and WSSe with expanded inter-layer spacing, as well as an interconnected porous structure. As a result, the WSSe@CPCS anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) exhibits preeminent reversible capacities, excellent cycle stability, and superior rate capability. The systematic electrochemical kinetic analysis and density functional theory results further show that the effect of anion vacancies and CPCS synergistically enhances the conductivity and reduces charge transfer resistance, thus making a great contribution to fast reaction kinetics. Finally, the implementations of the WSSe@CPCS anode in progressive SIB and DIB full-cell configurations exhibit satisfactory performance, which reveals their widely practical application. This research will provide an exciting approach to designing advanced defect-structured tungsten-based TMD materials for SIBs, DIBs, and even a broad range of energy storage.",

However, searching for suitable anode materials with high-rate and stable cycling performance is still needed to promote their practical application. Herein, three-dimensional Na2Ti3O7 nanowire arrays with enriched surface vacancies endowed by phosphorus doping are reported. When evaluated as anodes for sodium-ion batteries, the electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 290 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C, good rate capability (50 mAh g-1 at 20 C), and stable cycling capability (98% capacity retention over 3100 cycles at 20 C). The superior electrochemical performance is attributed to the synergistic effects of the unique nanowire arrays and phosphorus doping. The rational structures can provide convenient channels to facilitate ions/electrons transport and improve the capacitive contributions. Moreover, the phosphorus-doping-induced surface vacancies not only provide more active sites but also improve the intrinsic electrical conductivity of Na2Ti3O7, which will enable the electrode materials with excellent sodium storage performance. This work may provide an effective strategy for the synthesis of other anode materials with fast electrochemical reaction kinetics and good sodium storage performance.",

        "abstract": "Room-temperature Na ion batteries (NIBs) have attracted great attention because of the widely available, abundant sodium resources and potentially low cost. Currently, the challenge of the NIB development is due primarily to the lack of a high-performance anode, while the Na metal anode holds great promise considering its highest specific capacity of 1165 mA h/g and lowest anodic potential. However, an uneven deposit, relatively infinite volume change, and dendritic growth upon plating/stripping cycles cause a low Coulombic efficiency, poor cycling performance, and severe safety concerns. Here, a stable Na carbonized wood (Na-wood) composite anode was fabricated via a rapid melt infusion (about 5 s) into channels of carbonized wood by capillary action. The channels function as a high-surface-area, conductive, mechanically stable skeleton, which lowers the effective current density, ensures a uniform Na nucleation, and restricts the volume change over cycles. As a result, the Na-wood composite anode exhibited flat plating/stripping profiles with smaller overpotentials and stable cycling performance over 500 h at 1.0 mA/cm2 in a common carbonate electrolyte system. In sharp comparison, the planar Na metal electrode showed a much shorter cycle life of 100 h under the same test conditions.",

However, their viability is severely hampered by dendrite‐related hazards on anodes. Herein, a novel ultrathin (8 µm) exterior‐nonporous separator composed of honeycomb‐structured fibers is prepared for homogeneous Na deposition and suppressed dendrite penetration. The unhindered ion transmission greatly benefits from honeycomb‐structured fibers with huge electrolyte uptake (376.7%) and the polymer's inherent transport ability. Additionally, polar polymer chains consisting of polyethersulfone and polyvinylidene customize the highly aggregated solvation structure of electrolytes via substantial solvent immobilization, facilitating ion‐conductivity‐enhanced inorganic‐rich solid‐electrolyte interphase with remarkable interface endurance. With the reliable mechanical strength of the separator, the assembled sodium‐ion full cell delivers significantly improved energy density and high safety, enabling stable operation under cutting and rolling. The as‐prepared separator can further be generalized to lithium‐based batteries for which apparent dendrite inhibition and cyclability are accessible and demonstrates its potential for practical application.",

        "abstract": "Developing hard carbon with a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and very good cycling stability is of great importance for practical sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Defects and oxygen-containing groups grown along either the carbon edges or the layers, however, are inevitable in hard carbon and can cause a tremendous density of irreversible Na+ sites, decreasing the efficiency and therefore causing failure of the battery. Thus, eliminating these unexpected defect structures is significant for enhancing the battery performance. Herein, we develop a strategy of applying a soft-carbon coating onto free-standing hard-carbon electrodes, which greatly hinders the formation of defects and oxygen-containing groups on hard carbon. The electrochemical results show that the soft-carbon-coated, free-standing hard-carbon electrodes can achieve an ultrahigh ICE of 94.1% and long cycling performance (99% capacity retention after 100 cycles at a current density of 20 mA g-1), demonstrating their great potential in practical sodium storage systems. The sodium storage mechanism was also investigated by operando Raman spectroscopy. Our sodium storage mechanism extends the \"adsorption-intercalation-pore filling-deposition\" model. We propose that the pore filling in the plateau area might be divided into two parts: (1) sodium could fill in the pores near the inner wall of the carbon layer; (2) when the sodium in the inner wall pores is close to saturation, the sodium could be further deposited onto the existing sodium.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been extensively studied owing to the abundance and low-price of Na resources. However, the infeasibility of graphite and silicon electrodes in sodium-ion storage makes it urgent to develop high-performance anode materials. Herein, α-MnSe nanorods derived from δ-MnO2 (δ-α-MnSe) are constructed as anodes for SIBs. It is verified that α-MnSe will be transferred into β-MnSe after the initial Na-ion insertion/extraction, and δ-α-MnSe undergoes typical conversion mechanism using a Mn-ion for charge compensation in the subsequent charge-discharge process. First-principles calculations support that Na-ion migration in defect-free α-MnSe can drive the lattice distortion to phase transition (alpha → beta) in thermodynamics and dynamics. The formed β-MnSe with robust lattice structure and small Na-ion diffusion barrier boosts great structure stability and electrochemical kinetics. Hence, the δ-α-MnSe electrode contributes excellent rate capability and superior cyclic stability with long lifespan over 1000 cycles and low decay rate of 0.0267% per cycle. Na-ion full batteries with a high energy density of 281.2 Wh·kg-1 and outstanding cyclability demonstrate the applicability of δ-α-MnSe anode.",

        "abstract": "There are only a handful of reports on indium sulfide (In2S3) in the electrochemical energy storage field without a clear electrochemical reaction mechanism. In this work, a simple electrospinning method has been used to synthesize In2S3/C nanofibers for the first time. In lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the In2S3/C nanofiber electrode can not only deliver a high initial reversible specific capacity of 696.4 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1, but also shows ultra-long cycle life with a capacity retention of 80.5% after 600 cycles at 1000 mA g-1. In sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), the In2S3/C nanofibers electrode can exhibit a high initial reversible specific capacity (393.7 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1) and excellent cycling performance with a high capacity retention of 97.3% after 300 cycles at 1000 mA g-1. The excellent electrochemical properties mainly benefited from In2S3 being encapsulated by a carbon matrix, which buffers the volume expansion and significantly improves the conductivity of the composite. Furthermore, the structural evolution of In2S3 during the first lithiation/delithiation and sodiation/desodiation processes has been illustrated by ex situ XRD. The results confirm that the reaction mechanism of In2S3 in both LIBs and SIBs can be summarized as conversion reactions and alloying reactions, which provide theoretical support for the development of In2S3 in the field of electrochemistry.",

        "abstract": "Owing to several advantages of metallic sodium (Na), such as a relatively high theoretical capacity, low redox potential, wide availability, and low cost, Na metal batteries are being extensively studied, which are expected to play a major role in the fields of electric vehicles and grid-scale energy storage. Although considerable efforts have been devoted to utilizing MXene-based materials for suppressing Na dendrites, achieving a stable cycling of Na metal anodes remains extremely challenging due to, for example, the low Coulombic efficiency (CE) caused by the severe side reactions. Herein, a g-C3N4 layer was attached in situ on the Ti3C2 MXene surface, inducing a surface state reconstruction and thus forming a stable hetero-interphase with excellent sodiophilicity between the MXene and g-C3N4 to inhibit side reactions and guide uniform Na ion flux. The 3D construction can not only lower the local current density to facilitate uniform Na plating/stripping but also mitigate volume change to stabilize the electrolyte/electrode interphase. Thus, the 3D Ti3C2 MXene@g-C3N4 nanocomposite enables much enhanced average CEs (99.9% at 1 mA h cm-2, 0.5 mA cm-2) in asymmetric half cells, long-term stability (up to 700 h) for symmetric cells, and stable cycling (up to 800 cycles at 2 C), together with outstanding rate capability (up to 20 C), of full cells.

Alloy-type anode materials for sodium-ion batteries are esteemed as prospective candidate materials for sodium-ion anodes, owing to their elevated theoretical capacity, heightened utilization efficiency, and minimal production of insulating byproducts. However, the severe volume changes and sluggish ion diffusion kinetics can lead to irreversible particle fragmentation and reaggregation phenomena, ultimately resulting in electrode degradation. Additionally, repetitive volume changes can cause an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). This study presents the synthesis of chloride-ion-modulated bimetallic SnSb/C nanoparticle anode materials, highlighting the following advantages: (i) Designing a bimetallic SnSb alloy structure serves to buffer the structural stresses generated during sodium insertion/extraction processes, effectively mitigating particle fracture phenomena induced by electrode material expansion/contraction. (ii) Nanostructuring both alloy materials enables the full utilization of active materials and shortens diffusion pathways, thereby significantly enhancing the diffusion rate of sodium ions. (iii) Introducing a carbonaceous matrix serves to alleviate self-agglomeration phenomena of the material during charge/discharge cycles, enhancing the material's conductivity and structural stability.

When evaluated as an anode for lithium-ion batteries, the Fe2 O3 @C@MoS2 /CFC electrode manifests an outstanding electrochemical performance with a high discharge capacity of 1541.2 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and a good capacity retention of 80.1% at 1.0 A g-1 after 500 cycles. As for sodium-ion batteries, it retains a high reversible capacity of 889.4 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 over 200 cycles. The superior electrochemical performance mainly results from the unique 3D ordered Fe2 O3 @C@MoS2 array-type nanostructures and the synergistic effect between the C@MoS2 nanosheet arrays and Fe2 O3 nanoparticles. The Fe2 O3 nanoparticles act as spacers to steady the structure, and the graphite carbon could be incorporated into MoS2 nanosheets to improve the conductivity of the whole electrode and strengthen the integration of MoS2 nanosheets and CFC by the adhesive role, together ensuring high conductivity and mechanical stability.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries offer an attractive option for grid-level energy storage due to the high natural abundance of sodium and low material cost of sodium compounds. Phosphorus (P) is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries, with a theoretical capacity of 2596 mAh/g. The red phosphorus (RP) form has worse electronic conductivity and lower initial Coulombic efficiency than black phosphorus (BP), but high material cost and limited production capacity have slowed the development of BP anodes. To address these challenges, we have developed a simple and scalable method to synthesize layered BP/graphene composite (BP/rGO) by pressurization at room temperature. A carbon-black-free and binder-free BP/rGO anode prepared with this method achieved specific charge capacities of 1460.1, 1401.2, 1377.6, 1339.7, 1277.8, 1123.78, and 720.8 mAh/g in a rate capability test at charge and discharge current densities of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, and 40 A/g, respectively. In a cycling performance test, after 500 deep cycles, the capacity of BP/rGO anodes stabilized at 1250 and 640 mAh/g at 1 and 40 A/g, respectively, which marks a significant performance improvement for sodium-ion battery anodes.",

However, they usually exhibit inferior thermodynamic stability and sluggish Na+ kinetics due to the unwanted phase transitions and large Na+-ionic radius. In this work, considering the beneficial synergistic effects of layered P2/P3 and Fd3[combining macron]m spinel phases, a stable layered/spinel intergrowth nanocomposite Na0.5[Ni0.2Co0.15Mn0.65]O2 is rationally designed and successfully prepared via a co-precipitation route and a subsequent solid-state reaction, and the triphase synergy in this layered/spinel nanocomposite is demonstrated. In Na/Na0.5[Ni0.2Co0.15Mn0.65]O2 half-cells, it delivers a high specific capacity of ∼180 mA h g-1 and a good cycling stability, with a capacity retention of 87.6% after 100 cycles, at a rate of 0.1C between 1.5 and 4.0 V (vs. Na/Na+). The large reversible capacity of 105 mA h g-1 is also achieved even at a high rate of 10C, indicating high-rate capability. Besides, the full-cells using this nanocomposite as the cathode and hard carbon as the anode exhibit long-term cycle-life and high-power properties, indicating the expected merits of layered/spinel mixed phases. The superior sodium storage performance of this layered P3/P2 and spinel intergrowth nanocomposite makes it a promising candidate as a long-life and high-rate cathode for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Electrochemical ion storage behaviors of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, as a representative transition metal oxide for an environmentally benign and low-cost anode for a sodium-ion battery, are thoroughly investigated through a combination of electrochemical analysis and diagnostics of Fe3O4 electrode cells, X-ray-based and spectroscopic analysis of material structure evolution as functions of depth of discharge (DoD) and state of charge (SoC), and first principle modeling. The gravimetric capacity is found to be 50 mA h/g for bulk Fe3O4 (50 nm average crystallite size) and 100 mA h/g─about a tenth of the theoretical prediction for complete conversion─for Fe3O4 nanoparticles (8.7 nm average particle size), respectively. A fundamental and mechanistic study of material evolution as functions of DoD and SoC shows that Fe3O4 does not allow electrochemical incorporation of Na+ ions into the empty cation positions of the inverse spinel structure, leading to our assertion that electrochemical intercalation of Na+ ions to conversion of the Fe3O4 anode in sodium-ion batteries is nonviable. A density functional theory investigation points to the impracticality of the intercalation of Na+ ions into Fe3O4 and further validates our experimental findings. We propose several possible mechanisms corresponding to the observed low capacity, including formation of solid electrolyte interphases with unfavorable properties and adsorption of Na+ ions onto surfaces of nanoparticles and/or at heterointerfaces in Fe3O4 composite electrodes in a NaPF6-based electrolyte system.",

However, its development is hampered by the limited metallic utilization and detrimental sodium dendrite growth ascribed to the unstable, and fragile solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Here, the high stable and modulus SEI is constructed with a component of a thin and dense layer of high Na‐ion conductive Na2SiO3. It is in situ formed by the reaction between sodium anode and fish‐skin structure separator, which exhibits a 3D porous polyvinylidene fluoride‐based framework embedded with thin and robust vermiculite sheets. The robust interphase cannot only suppress sodium dendrite growth but also enable high energy density with small interphase‐consumed Na ions in anode‐less batteries. Accordingly, the as‐assembled NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2//Na cell shows 83% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at a rate of 5 °C. Moreover, the proof‐of‐concept pouch cells deliver an energy density of 205 Wh kg−1 (based on the total mass of the battery), and high safety (not catching fire after punctured) under anode‐less condition (with a low negative/positive capacity ratio of ≈2.1).",

Here, a dual-carbon conductive network enhanced GeP5 (GeP5/acetylene black/partially reduced graphene oxide sheets (GeP5/AB/p-rGO)) composite is successfully prepared by a facile ball milling method. The dual-carbon network not only provides more transport pathways for electrons but also relaxes the huge volume change of the electrode material during the charge/discharge process. Compared with only AB- or GO-modified GeP5 (GeP5/AB or GeP5/GO) composite, the GeP5/AB/p-rGO composite shows a superior sodium storage performance with an excellent rate and cycle performance. It delivers a high reversible capacity of 597.5 and 175 mAh/g at the current density of 0.1 and 5.0 A/g, respectively. Furthermore, at the current density of 0.5 A/g, the GeP5/AB/p-rGO composite shows the reversible capacity of 400 mAh/g after 50 cycles with a little capacity attenuation.

Herein, with the assistance of a simple calcination method and common raw materials, the environmentally friendly and nontoxic N‐doped C@Zn3B2O6 composite is directly synthesized and proved to be a potential anode material for NIBs. The composite demonstrates a high reversible charge capacity of 446.2 mAh g−1 and a safe and suitable average voltage of 0.69 V, together with application potential in full cells (discharge capacity of 98.4 mAh g−1 and long cycle performance of 300 cycles at 1000 mA g−1). In addition, the sodium‐ion storage mechanism of N‐doped C@Zn3B2O6 is subsequently studied through air‐insulated ex situ characterizations of X‐ray diffraction (XRD), X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier‐transform infrared (FT‐IR) spectroscopy, and is found to be rather different from previous reports on borate anode materials for NIBs and lithium‐ion batteries. The reaction mechanism is deduced and proposed as: Zn3B2O6 + 6Na+ + 6e− ⇋ 3Zn + B2O3 ∙ 3Na2O, which indicates that the generated boracic phase is electrochemically active and participates in the later discharge/charge progress.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfide‐based anodes usually suffer from huge volumetric change and sluggish reaction kinetics, hindering their application for long‐term and high‐power/energy sodium‐ion batteries. Herein, a new design of CoS2‐xSex (0≤x≤2) nanocrystals with highly controllable selenium substitution and S, Se‐codoped graphene immobilization (CoS2‐xSex@SG) is proposed to tune the reaction kinetics and structural stability. The nanocrystal‐on‐graphene structure and robust C─S &C─Se bonding rivets between CoS2‐xSex and SG greatly improve the structural stability of the CoS2‐xSex@SG. Electrochemical performance, kinetic analysis, and theoretical calculation reveal that Se substitution plays a double‐edged role in sodium storage: the increase of Se substitution content enhances the Na+ diffusion kinetics but decreases the Na‐storage capacity. When the Se substitution content is 0.4, the CoS1.6Se0.4@SG electrode demonstrates the best performance: high initial Coulombic efficiency (95.5%), ultrahigh rate capability (412.8 mAh g−1 at 30 A g−1), and ultra‐stable cycling performance (97.6% capacity retention after 1000 cycles). In situ/ex situ measurements further unveil that the conversion reaction between Co0 and Na2S/Na2Se generates the micro‐scaled CoSe2–CoS2 heterostructure, synergistically improving the Na‐storage active sites and reaction kinetics.

        "abstract": "Metal sulfides are gaining prominence as conversion anode materials for lithium/sodium ion batteries due to their higher specific capacities but suffers from low stability and reversibility issues. In this work, the electrochemical properties of CuS anode material has been successfully enhanced by its composite formation using graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4). The CuS nanoparticles are distributed evenly in the exfoliated g-C3N4 matrix rendering higher electronic conductivity and space for volume alterations during the repeated discharge/charge cycles. The 0.8CuS:0.2g-C3N4 composite when used as an anode for lithium ion coin cell exhibits a reversible capacity of 478.4 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 2.0 A g−1 after a run of 1000 cycles which is better than that reported for CuS composites with any other carbon-based matrix. The performance is equally impressive when 0.8CuS:0.2g-C3N4 composite is used as an anode in a sodium ion coin cell and a reversible capacity of 408 mA h g−1 is obtained at a current rate of 2.0 A g−1 after a run of 800 cycles. A sodium ion full cell with NVP cathode and 0.8CuS:0.2g-C3N4 composite anode has been fabricated and cycled for 100 runs at a current rate of 0.1 A g−1. It can be inferred that the g-C3N4 matrix improves the ion transfer properties, alleviates the volume alteration happening in the anode during the discharge/charge process and also helps in preventing the leaching of polysulfides generated during the electrochemical process.",

        "abstract": "Alloying-type antimony (Sb) with high theoretical capacity is a promising anode candidate for both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Given the larger radius of Na+ (1.02 Å) than Li+ (0.76 Å), it was generally believed that the Sb anode would experience even worse capacity degradation in SIBs due to more substantial volumetric variations during cycling when compared to LIBs. However, the Sb anode in SIBs unexpectedly exhibited both better electrochemical and structural stability than in LIBs, and the mechanistic reasons that underlie this performance discrepancy remain undiscovered. Here, using substantial in situ transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman techniques complemented by theoretical simulations, we explicitly reveal that compared to lithiation/delithiation process, sodiation/desodiation process of Sb anode displays a previously unexplored two-stage alloying/dealloying mechanism with polycrystalline and amorphous phases as the intermediates featuring improved resilience to mechanical damage, contributing to superior cycling stability in SIBs. Additionally, the better mechanical properties and weaker atomic interaction of Na-Sb alloys than Li-Sb alloys favor enabling mitigated mechanical stress, accounting for enhanced structural stability as unveiled by theoretical simulations. Our finding delineates the mechanistic origins of enhanced cycling stability of Sb anode in SIBs with potential implications for other large-volume-change electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "Carbon-encapsulated Sn@N-doped carbon tubes with submicron diameters were obtained via the simple reduction of C@SnO2@N-doped carbon composites that were fabricated by a hydrothermal approach. Sn nanoparticles encapsulated in carbon layers were distributed uniformly on the surfaces of the N-doped carbon nanotubes. The electrochemical performances of the composites were systematically investigated as anode materials in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The composite electrode could attain a good reversible capacity of 398.4 mAh g-1 when discharging at 100 mA g-1, with capacity retention of 67.3% and very high Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% over 150 cycles. This good cycling performance, when compared to only 17.5 mAh g-1 delivered by bare Sn particles prepared via the same method without the presence of N-doped carbon, could be mainly ascribed to the uniform distribution of the precursor SnO2 on the substrate of N-doped carbon tubes with three-dimensional structure, which provides more reaction sites to reduce the diffusion distance of Na+, further facilitating Na+-ion diffusion and relieves the huge volume expansion during charging/discharging. These outcomes imply that such a Sn/C composite would provide more options as an anode candidate for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as the ideal candidates for the next generation of electrochemical energy storage devices. The major challenges of anode lie in poor cycling stability and the sluggish kinetics attributed to the inherent large Na+ size. In this work, Bi nanosphere encapsulated in N‐doped carbon nanowires (Bi@N‐C) is assembled by facile electrospinning and carbonization. N‐doped carbon mitigates the structure stress/strain during alloying/dealloying, optimizes the ionic/electronic diffusion, and provides fast electron transfer and structural stability. Due to the excellent structure, Bi@N‐C shows excellent Na storage performance in SIBs in terms of good cycling stability and rate capacity in half cells and full cells. The fundamental mechanism of the outstanding electrochemical performance of Bi@N‐C has been demonstrated through synchrotron in‐situ XRD, atomic force microscopy, ex‐situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Importantly, a deeper understanding of the underlying reasons of the performance improvement is elucidated, which is vital for providing the theoretical basis for application of SIBs.",

Herein, a general and scalable solvent-exchange strategy is presented for uniform dispersion of few-layer MoS2 (f-MoS2 ) from high-boiling-point solvents (N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), N,N-dimethyl formaldehyde (DMF), etc.) into low-boiling-point solvents (water, ethanol, etc.). The solvent-exchange strategy dramatically simplifies high-yield production of dispersible MoS2 nanosheets as well as facilitates subsequent decoration of MoS2 for various applications. As a demonstration, MoS2 -decorated nitrogen-rich carbon spheres (MoS2 -NCS) are prepared via in situ growth of polypyrrole and subsequent pyrolysis. Benefiting from its ultrathin feature, largely exposed active surface, highly conductive framework and excellent structural integrity, the 2D core-shell architecture of MoS2 -NCS exhibits an outstanding reversible capacity and excellent cycling performance, achieving high initial discharge capacity of 1087.5 and 508.6 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 , capacity retentions of 95.6% and 94.2% after 500 and 250 charge/discharge cycles at 1 A g-1 , for lithium/sodium ion storages, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Autonomic self-healing (SH), namely, the ability to repair damages from mechanical stress spontaneously, is polarizing attention in the field of new-generation electrochemical devices. This property is highly attractive to enhance the durability of rechargeable Li-ion batteries (LIBs) or Na-ion batteries (SIBs), where high-performing anode active materials (silicon, phosphorus, etc.) are strongly affected by volume expansion and phase changes upon ion insertion. Here, we applied a SH strategy, based on the dynamic quadruple hydrogen bonding, to nanosized black phosphorus (BP) anodes for Na-ion cells. The goal is to overcome drastic capacity decay and short lifetime, resulting from mechanical damages induced by the volumetric expansion/contraction upon sodiation/desodiation. Specifically, we developed novel ureidopyrimidinone (UPy)-telechelic systems and related blends with poly(ethylene oxide) as novel and green binders alternative to the more conventional ones, such as polyacrylic acid and carboxymethylcellulose, which are typically used in SIBs. BP anodes show impressively improved (more than 6 times) capacity retention when employing the new SH polymeric blend. In particular, the SH electrode still works at a current density higher than 3.5 A g–1, whereas the standard BP electrode exhibits very poor performances already at current densities lower than 0.5 A g–1. This is the result of better adhesion, buffering properties, and spontaneous damage reparation.",

The optimized LSCa‐derived carbon delivers a high reversible capacity of 317 mA h g−1 at 30 mA g−1 with ~60% plateau capacity, and it retains a capacity of 170 mA h g−1 even at 3000 mA g−1. These achievements are ascribed to the larger d002 values, smaller defects, and more closed pores, compared with the original sample from the direct carbonization of LSCa.",

        "abstract": "Tin oxide (SnO) is considered one of the most promising metal oxides for utilization as anode material in sodium ion batteries (SIBs), because of its ease of synthesis, high specific gravimetric capacity, and satisfactory cycling performance. However, to aim at practical applications, the Coulombic efficiency during cycling needs to be further improved, which requires a deeper knowledge of its working mechanism. Here, a microflower-shaped SnO material is synthesized by means of an ultrafast ionic liquid-assisted microwave method. The as-prepared SnO anode active material exhibits excellent cycling performance, good Coulombic efficiency as well as a large capacity delivered at low potential, which is fundamental to maximize the energy output of SIBs. These overall merits were never reported before for pure SnO anodes (i.e., not in a composite with, for example, graphene). Additionally, by combining ex situ XRD and XPS, it is clearly demonstrated for the first time that the Sn-Na alloy, which is formed during the initial sodium sodiation, desodiates in two successive but fully separated steps. Totally different from the previous report, the pristine SnO phase is not regenerated upon desodiation up to 3 V vs Na/Na+. The newly disclosed reaction route provides an alternative view of the complex reaction mechanism of these families of metal oxides for sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Highly porous carbon materials with a rationally designed pore structure can be utilized as reservoirs for metal or nonmetal components. The use of small-sized metal or metal compound nanoparticles, completely encapsulated by carbon materials, has attracted significant attention as an effective approach to enhancing sodium ion storage properties. These materials have the ability to mitigate structural collapse caused by volume expansion during the charging process, enable short ion transport length, and prevent polysulfide elution. In this study, a concept of highly porous carbon-coated carbon nanotube (CNT) porous microspheres, which serve as excellent reservoir materials is suggested and a porous microsphere is developed by encapsulating iron sulfide nanocrystals within the highly porous carbon-coated CNTs using a sulfidation process. Furthermore, various sulfidation processes to determine the optimal method for achieving complete encapsulation are investigated by comparing the morphologies of diverse iron sulfide-carbon composites. The fully encapsulated structure, combined with the porous carbon, provides ample space to accommodate the significant volume changes during cycling. As a result, the porous iron sulfide-carbon-CNT composite microspheres exhibited outstanding cycling stability (293 mA h g-1 over 600 cycles at 1 A g-1 ) and remarkable rate capability (100 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1 ).",

        "abstract": "Abstract Amorphous carbon holds great promise as anode material for sodium‐ion batteries due to its cost‐effectiveness and good performance. However, its sodium storage mechanism, particularly the insertion process and origin of plateau capacity, remains controversial. Here, an extended adsorption/insertion‐filling sodium storage mechanism is proposed using petroleum coke‐derived amorphous carbon as a multi‐microcrystalline model. Combining in situ X‐ray diffraction, in situ Raman, theoretical calculations, and neutron scattering, the effective storage form and location of sodium ions in amorphous carbon are revealed. The sodium adsorption at defect sites leads to a high‐potential sloping capacity. The sodium insertion process occurs in both the pseudo‐graphite phase (d 002 > 0.370 nm) and graphite‐like phase (0.345 ≤ d 002 < 0.370 nm) rather than the graphite phase, contributing to low‐potential sloping capacity. The sodium filling into accessible closed pores forms quasi‐metallic sodium clusters, contributing to plateau capacity. The threshold of the effective interlayer spacing for sodium insertion is extended to 0.345 nm, breaking the consensus of insertion interlayer threshold and enhancing understanding of closed pore filling. The extended adsorption/insertion‐filling mechanism explains the sodium storage behavior of amorphous carbon with different microstructures, providing theoretical guidance for the rational design of high‐performance amorphous carbon anodes.",

Nevertheless, due to a lack of direct atomistic observation, the detailed understanding of fundamental intercalation behavior and Bi2S3's (de)sodiation mechanisms remains unclear. Here, by employing in situ high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy, consecutive electron diffraction coupled with theoretical calculations, it is not only for the first time identified that Bi2S3 exhibits specific ionic transport pathways preferred to diffuse along the (110) direction instead of the (200) plane, but also tracks their real‐time phase transformations (de)sodiation involving multi‐step crystallographic tuning.

        "title": "Highly Reversible Sodium Metal Battery Anodes via Alloying Heterointerfaces.",
        "abstract": "As a promising pathway toward low-cost, long-duration energy storage, rechargeable sodium batteries are of increasing interest. Batteries that incorporate metallic sodium as anode promise a high theoretical specific capacity of 1166 mAh g-1 , and low reduction potential of -2.71 V. The high reactivity and poor electrochemical reversibility of sodium anodes render sodium metal anode (SMA) cells among the most challenging for practical implementation. Here, the failure mechanisms of Na anodes are investigated and the authors report that loss of morphological control is not the fundamental cause of failure. Rather, it is the inherently poor anchoring/root structure of electrodeposited Na to the electrode substrate that leads to poor reversibility and cell failure. Poorly anchored Na deposits are prone to break away from the current collector, producing orphaning and poor anode utilization. Thin metallic coatings in a range of chemistries are proposed and evaluated as SMA substrates. Based on thermodynamic and ion transport considerations, such substrates undergo reversible alloying reactions with Na and are hypothesized to promote good root growth-regardless of the morphology. Among the various options, Au stands out for its ability to support long Na anode lifetime and high reversibility (Coulombic Efficiency > 98%), for coating thicknesses in the range of 10-1000 nm. As a first step toward evaluating practical utility of the anodes, their performance in Na||SPAN cells with N:P ratio close to 1:1 is evaluated.",

Herein, we demonstrate a stable and high-rate sodium-metal battery enabled by a nonaqueous polyelectrolyte solution composed of a weakly coordinating polyanion-type Na salt, poly[(4-styrenesulfonyl)-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide] (poly(NaSTFSI)) copolymerized with butyl acrylate, in a propylene carbonate solution.

Furthermore, the surface of the Na electrode was modified with polyanion chains anchored via the partial decomposition of the electrolyte. The surface-tethered polyanion layer effectively suppressed the subsequent decomposition of the electrolyte, thereby enabling stable Na deposition/dissolution cycling. Finally, an assembled sodium-metal battery with a Na0.44MnO2 cathode demonstrated an outstanding charge/discharge reversibility (Coulombic efficiency >99.8%) over 200 cycles while also exhibiting a high discharge rate (i.e., 45% capacity retention at 10 mA cm-2).",

However, the practical application of sodium-ion batteries is restricted by unsatisfying capacity and poor rate capability. Herein, a novel mechanism of improving both interfacial and surface charge transfer is proposed by fabricating a graphene oxide/SnO2/Co3O4 nanocomposite through a simple hydrothermal method. The formation of heterostructures between ultrafine SnO2 and Co3O4 could enhance the charge transfer of interfaces owing to the internal electric field. The pseudocapacitive effect, which is led by the high specific area and the existence of ultrafine nanoparticles, takes on a feature of fast faradaic surface charge-transfer. Benefiting from the synergistic advantages of the heterostructures and the pseudocapacitive effect, the as-prepared graphene oxide/SnO2/Co3O4 anode achieved a high reversible capacity of 461 mA h g-1 after 80 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g-1. Additionally, at a high current density of 1 A g-1, a high reversible capacity of 241 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles is obtained. A full cell coupled by the as-prepared graphene oxide/SnO2/Co3O4 anode and the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode was also constructed, which exhibited a reversible capacity of 310.3 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 1 A g-1.

        "title": "Co-construction of sulfur vacancies and carbon confinement in V5S8/CNFs to induce an ultra-stable performance for half/full sodium-ion and potassium-ion batteries.",
        "abstract": "The construction of anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) with a high energy and a long lifespan is significant and still challenging. Here, sulfur-defective vanadium sulfide/carbon fiber composites (D-V5S8/CNFs) are designed and fabricated by a facile electrospinning method, followed by sulfuration treatment. The unique architecture, in which V5S8 nanoparticles are confined inside the carbon fiber, provides a short-range channel and abundant adsorption sites for ion storage. Moreover, enlarged interlayer spacings could also alleviate the volume changes, and offer small vdW interactions and ionic diffusion resistance to store more Na and K ions reversibly and simultaneously. The DFT calculations further demonstrate that sulfur defects can effectively facilitate the adsorption behavior of Na+ and K+ and offer low energy barriers for ion intercalation. Taking advantage of the functional integration of these merits, the D-V5S8/CNF anode exhibits excellent storage performance and long-term cycling stability. It reveals a high capacity of 462 mA h g-1 at a current density of 0.2 A g-1 in SIBs, while it is 350 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 in PIBs, as well as admirable long-term cycling characteristics (190 mA h g-1/17 000 cycles/5 A g-1 for SIBs and 165 mA h g-1/3000 cycles/1 A g-1 for PIBs). Practically, full SIBs upon pairing with a Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode also exhibit superior performance.",

        "title": "Three-dimensional macroporous graphene monoliths with entrapped MoS2 nanoflakes from single-step synthesis for high-performance sodium-ion batteries",
        "abstract": "Layered metal sulfides (MoS2, WS2, SnS2, and SnS) offer high potential as advanced anode materials in sodium ion batteries upon integration with highly-conductive graphene materials. However, in addition to being costly and time-consuming, existing strategies for synthesizing sulfides/graphene composites often involve complicated procedures. It is therefore essential to develop a simple yet scalable pathway to construct sulfide/graphene composites for practical applications. Here, we highlight a one-step, template-free, high-throughput “self-bubbling” method for producing MoS2/graphene composites, which is suitable for large-scale production of sulfide/graphene composites. The final product featured MoS2 nanoflakes distributed in three-dimensional macroporous monolithic graphene. Moreover, this unique MoS2/graphene composite achieved remarkable electrochemical performance when being applied to Na-ion battery anodes; namely, excellent cycling stability (474 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles) and high rate capability (406 mA h g−1 at 0.25 A g−1 and 359 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1). This self-bubbling approach should be applicable to delivering other graphene-based composites for emerging applications such as energy storage, catalysis, and sensing.",

        "title": "Impact of Electrolyte Salts on Na Storage Performance for High-Surface-Area Carbon Anodes.",
        "abstract": "High-surface-area carbon (HSAC) has been regarded as one of the most promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. However, it generally suffers from low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), which is closely related to the formation process of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Herein, the impact of different electrolyte salts on the electrochemical performance and SEI formation of a commercial HSAC anode is studied. It is found that the use of NaCF3SO3 enables much higher ICE (69.28%) and reversible capacity (283 mA h g-1) of the HSAC anode compared with the NaPF6 electrolyte (59.65%, 243 mA h g-1). Through comprehensive characterizations, the improvement in electrochemical performance facilitated by NaCF3SO3 could be attributed to the reduced amount of NaxC and the thinner SEI formed on the surface of HSAC during the initial cycle, which not only provides extra active sites for Na+ storage but also contributes to the promoted ICE. This work not only provides a deeper understanding of the role of electrolyte salt in SEI formation in the HSAC anode but also proposes a new method to further promote the ICE of the HSAC anode in sodium-ion batteries.",

It delivered a remarkable charge capacity of 656.75 mA h g-1 in the first cycle and a capacity retention of 97% after 100 cycles.

        "title": "Effect of the Particle-Size Distribution on the Electrochemical Performance of a Red Phosphorus–Carbon Composite Anode for Sodium-Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "Red phosphorus (RP) is a promising candidate as an anode for sodium-ion batteries because of its low potential and high specific capacity. It has two main disadvantages. First, it experiences 490% volumetric expansion during sodiation, which leads to particle pulverization and substantial reduction of the cycle life. Second, it has an extremely low electronic conductivity of 10–14 S cm–1. Both issues can be addressed by ball milling RP with a carbon matrix to form a composite of electronically conductive carbon and small RP particles, less susceptible to pulverization. Through this procedure, however, the resulting particle-size distribution of the RP particles is difficult to determine because of the presence of the carbon particles. Here, we quantify the relationship between the RP particle-size distribution and its cycle life for the first time by separating the ball-milling process into two steps. The RP is first wet-milled to reduce the particle size, and then the particle-size distribution is measured via dynamic light scattering. This is followed by a dry-milling step to produce RP–graphite composites. We found that wet milling breaks apart the largest RP particles in the range of 2–10 μm, decreases the Dv90 from 1.85 to 1.26 μm, and significantly increases the cycle life of the RP. Photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy confirm the successful formation of a carbon coating, with longer milling times leading to more uniform carbon coatings. The RP with a Dv90 of 0.79 μm mixed with graphite for 48 h delivered 1354 mA h g–1 with high coulombic efficiency (>99%) and cyclability (88% capacity retention after 100 cycles). These results are an important step in the development of cyclable, high-capacity anodes for sodium-ion batteries.",

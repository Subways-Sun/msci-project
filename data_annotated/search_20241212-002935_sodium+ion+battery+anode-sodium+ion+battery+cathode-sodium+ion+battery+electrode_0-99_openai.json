        "abstract": "Rechargeable solid-state Na metal batteries (SSNMB) can offer high operational safety and energy density. However, poor solid-solid contact between the electrodes and the electrolyte can dramatically increase interfacial resistance and Na dendrite formation, even at low current rates. Therefore, we developed a carbon-fiber-supported liquid Na-K alloy anode that ensures close anode-electrolyte contact, enabling superior cycle stability and rate capability. We then demonstrated the first cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) characterization of an SSNMB, capturing the evolution of solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) and revealing both crystalline and amorphous phases, which could facilitate ion transport and prevent continuous side reactions. By enhancing contact between the Na-K alloy and solid-state electrolyte, these symmetric cells are capable of cycling for over 800 h without notable increased polarization and enable an unprecedented critical current density (CCD) at 40 mA cm-2. Our liquid Na-K alloy approach offers a promising strategic avenue toward commercial SSNMBs.",

        "abstract": "While lithium resources are scarce for high energy‐dense lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), serving as an alternative, inherently suffer from low capacity and the high‐cost use of non‐graphite anodes. Combining Li‐ and Na‐ions within a single battery system is expected to mitigate the shortcomings of both systems while leveraging their respective advantages. In this study, we developed and assembled a nanodiamonds (NDs)‐assisted co‐Li/Na‐ion battery (ND–LSIB). This innovative battery system comprised a commercial graphite anode, an ND‐modified polypropylene (DPP) separator, a hybrid lithium/sodium‐based electrolyte, and a cathode. It is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that the ND/Li co‐insertion can serve as an ion‐drill opening graphite layers and reconstructing graphite anodes into few‐layered graphene with expanding interlayer space, achieving highly efficient Li/Na storage and the theoretical maximum of LiC6 for Li storage in graphite. In addition, ND is helpful for creating a LiF‐/NaF‐rich hybrid solid electrolyte interface with improved ionic mobility, mechanical strength, and reversibility. Consequently, ND–LSIBs have higher specific capacities ~1.4 times the theoretical value of LIBs and show long‐term cycling stability. This study proposes and realizes the concept of Li/Na co‐storage in one ion battery with compatible high‐performance, cost‐effectiveness, and industrial prospects.",

        "abstract": "Rational construction of nanosized anode nanomaterials is crucial to enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium-/sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs). Various anode nanoparticles are created mainly via templating surface confinement, or encapsulation within precursors (such as metal-organic frameworks). Herein, low-content SnO2 nanodots on N-doped reduced graphene oxide (SnO2@N-rGO) were prepared as anode nanomaterials for LIBs and SIBs, via a distinctive lattice confinement of a CoAlSn-layered double hydroxide (CoAlSn-LDH) precursor. The SnO2@N-rGO composite exhibits the advantagous features of low-content (17.9 wt%) and uniform SnO2 nanodots (3.0 ± 0.5 nm) resulting from the lattice confinement of the Co and Al species to the surrounded Sn within the same crystalline layer, and high-content conductive rGO. The SnO2@N-rGO composite delivers a highly reversible capacity of 1146.2 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 for LIBs, and 387 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 for SIBs, outperforming N-rGO. Furthermore, the dominant capacitive contribution and the rapid electronic and ionic transfer, as well as small volume variation, all give rise to the enhancement. Precursor-based lattice confinement could thus be an effective strategy for designing and preparing uniform nanodots as anode nanomaterials for electrochemical energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Metallic selenides have been widely investigated as promising electrode materials for metal-ion batteries based on their relatively high theoretical capacity. However, rapid capacity decay and structural collapse resulting from the larger-sized Na+ /K+ greatly hamper their application. Herein, a bimetallic selenide (MoSe2 /CoSe2 ) encapsulated in nitrogen, sulfur-codoped hollow carbon nanospheres interconnected reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (rGO@MCSe) are successfully designed as advanced anode materials for Na/K-ion batteries. As expected, the significant pseudocapacitive charge storage behavior substantially contributes to superior rate capability. Specifically, it achieves a high reversible specific capacity of 311 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 in NIBs and 310 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 in KIBs. A combination of ex situ X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy tests reveals the phase transition of rGO@MCSe in NIBs/KIBs. Unexpectedly, they show quite different Na+ /K+ insertion/extraction reaction mechanisms for both cells, maybe due to more sluggish K+ diffusion kinetics than that of Na+ . More significantly, it shows excellent energy storage properties in Na/K-ion full cells when coupled with Na3 V2 (PO4 )2 O2 F and PTCDA@450 °C cathodes.

        "abstract": "Development of the next-generation, high-energy-density, low-cost batteries will likely be fueled by sodium (Na) metal batteries because of their high capacity and the abundance of Na. However, their practical application is significantly plagued by the hyper-reactivity of Na metal, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and dendritic Na growth, leading to continuous electrolyte decomposition, low Coulombic efficiency, large impedance, and safety concerns. Herein, we add a small amount of SnCl2 additive in a common carbonate electrolyte so that the spontaneous reaction between SnCl2 and Na metal enables in situ formation of a Na-Sn alloy layer and a compact NaCl-rich SEI. Benefitting from this design, rapid interfacial ion transfer is realized and direct exposure of Na metal to the electrolyte is prohibited, which jointly achieve a nondendritic deposition morphology and a markedly reduced voltage hysteresis in a Na/Na symmetric cell for over 500 h. The Na/SnCl2-added electrolyte/Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell exhibits high capacity retention over cycling and excellent rate capability (101 mAh/g at 10 C).

Herein, mesoporous, conductive, thin-wall three-dimension (3D) skeletons of molybdenum nitride (meso-Mo2N) were established and employed as anodes to facilitate rate performance for SIBs. Mesoporous channels (～9.3 nm) with very thin walls (＜8 nm) and conductive networks in meso-Mo2N enable the rapid Na+/Li+ infiltrability/diffusivity and smooth electron transfer, respectively. The fast ion diffusion/transfer ability is confirmed by galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, cyclic voltammetry tests with higher ion-diffusion dominated capacity and larger Na+ diffusion coefficient. Consequently, meso-Mo2N exhibited a superior rate capability and a stable specific capacity of 158 mAh g-1 (after 1000 cycles) at 1 A g-1 for SIBs, surpassing nonporous Mo2N and even the previously reported Mo2N. Furthermore, the proof of concept can be also extended to enhanced Li storage. Such mesostructured design with 3D mesoporous, conductive thin wall of electrodes is a promising strategy for achieving fast-charging and high-performance Na/Li storage.",

        "abstract": "We systematically investigated the potential of single-layer VS2 polytypes as Na-battery anode materials via density functional theory calculations. We found that sodiation tends to inhibit the 1H-to-1T structural phase transition, in contrast to lithiation-induced transition on monolayer MoS2. Thus, VS2 can have better structural stability in the cycles of charging and discharging. Diffussion of Na atom was found to be very fast on both polytypes, with very small diffusion barriers of 0.085 eV (1H) and 0.088 eV (1T). Ab initio random structure searching was performed in order to explore stable configurations of Na on VS2. Our search found that both the V top and the hexagonal center sites are preferred adsorption sites for Na, with the 1H phase showing a relatively stronger binding. Notably, our random structures search revealed that Na clusters can form as a stacked second layer at full Na concentration, which is not reported in earlier works wherein uniform, single-layer Na adsorption phases were assumed. With reasonably high specific energy capacity (232.91 and 116.45 mAh/g for 1H and 1T phases, respectively) and open-circuit voltage (1.30 and 1.42 V for 1H and 1T phases, respectively), VS2 is a promising alternative material for Na-ion battery anodes with great structural sturdiness. Finally, we have shown the capability of the ab initio random structure searching in the assessment of potential materials for energy storage applications.",

The optimized P-Bi@C-700 (annealed at 700 °C) demonstrates 359.8 mAh g-1 after 1500 cycles at 1 A g-1. In situ/ex situ characterization and density functional theory calculations verified that this P-Bi@C-700 relieves the volume expansion, facilitates Na+/electron transport, and possesses an alloying-type storage mechanism.

        "abstract": "Carbon materials are widely used for reversible lithium uptake in the anode of lithium-ion batteries. Nevertheless, the challenge of uncontrollable dendrite deposition during fast charge-discharge cycles remains a grand hurdle. Various strategies have been explored to prevent detrimental heterogeneous dendrite metal deposits, such as interface engineering and electrolyte modification, but they often compromise the reverse diffusion freedom of Li+ ions during discharging and are incompatible with the most mainstream use of graphite as an anode material. Here, we propose the incorporation of a novel carbon allotrope of cyclocarbon as a potential additive in the anode. In contrast to conventional carbon materials, density functional theory calculations reveal that cyclocarbon has a much higher affinity for Li atoms than Li+ ions, even surpassing the inherent cohesion of Li atoms, due to the charge transfer from the 2s orbital of Li atoms to the unique in-plane π orbital of cyclocarbon. Furthermore, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that Li+ ions can shuttle freely back and forth across cyclocarbon, whereas the lithiation process for Li atoms occurs rapidly within picoseconds. The delithiation of Li atoms within cyclocarbon follows a voltage-gated mechanism that is effectively controlled by an external electric field of 3 V nm-1. Remarkably, cyclocarbon exhibits potential compatibility with commercialized graphite electrodes via the π-π interaction and also can be extended to sodium-ion and potassium-ion batteries. These distinct compatibility, scalability and electrochemical properties of cyclocarbon provide a new avenue to realize both safety and ultrafast rechargeable performance of ion batteries.",

Herein, self‐supporting nitrogen‐doped and carbon‐coated 1T/2H mixed‐phase MoS2 nanosheets with rich sulfur vacancies on carbon cloth (C@N‐MoS2‐p/CC) are synthesized through a hydrothermal method and Ar/NH3 radio‐frequency (RF) plasma treatment process. Density‐functional‐theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that after Ar/NH3 RF plasma treatment, nitrogen‐doping and etching effects are realized, which combine with carbon‐coating significantly reduce the phase transition energy of 1T‐MoS2, thus triggering the phase transition and enabling the stable existence of the highly active 1T‐MoS2.

PMAI‐based anodic‐half cell exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, achieving higher capacities (297 mAhg−1 at 1C for LIBs and 250 mAhg−1 at 60 mAg−1 for SIBs) and good cycle stability (80 % capacity retention after 750 cycles for LIBs; 96% capacity retention after 200 cycles for SIBs), compared to PVDF binder. In addition, PMAI/Gr delivers a higher discharge capacity of 85 mAhg−1 than PVDF/Gr with 47 mAhg−1 at 5C. PMAI‐containing electrodes show better rate capability at different current densities than PVDF binder in LIB/SIB. The enhanced ion diffusion coefficient, lower resistance and decreased activation energy of desolvation, are ascribed to densely polar ionic liquid groups along the polymer and formation of a functionalized SEI via binder reduction. The novel PMAI binder's design and full‐cell examination confirm its potential in secondary‐ion battery applications.",

        "abstract": "Superior high‐rate performance and ultralong cycling life have been constantly pursued for rechargeable sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). In this work, a facile strategy is employed to successfully synthesize porous CoxP hierarchical nanostructures supported on a flexible carbon fiber cloth (CoxP@CFC), constructing a robust architecture of ordered nanoarrays. Via such a unique design, porous and bare structures can thoroughly expose the electroactive surfaces to the electrolyte, which is favorable for ultrafast sodium‐ion storage. In addition, the CFC provides an interconnected 3D conductive network to ensure firm electrical connection of the electrode materials. Besides the inherent flexibility of the CFC, the integration of the hierarchical structures of CoxP with the CFC, as well as the strong synergistic effect between them, effectively help to buffer the mechanical stress caused by repeated sodiation/desodiation, thereby guaranteeing the structural integrity of the overall electrode. Consequently, CoxP@CFC as an anode shows a record‐high capacity of 279 mAh g−1 at 5.0 A g−1 with almost no capacity attenuation after 9000 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Featuring a high theoretical capacity, low cost, and abundant resources, sodium metal has emerged as an ideal anode material for sodium ion batteries. However, the real feasibility of sodium metal anodes is still hampered by the uncontrolled sodium dendrite problems. Herein, an artificial three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical porous sodiophilic V2CTx/rGO-CNT microgrid aerogel is fabricated by a direct-ink writing 3D printing technology and further adopted as the matrix of Na metal to deliver a Na@V2CTx/rGO-CNT sodium metal anode. Upon cycling, the V2CTx/rGO-CNT electrode can yield a superior cycling life of more than 3000 h (2 mA cm-2, 10 mAh cm-2) with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.54%. More attractively, it can even sustain a stable operation over 900 h at 5 mA cm-2 with an ultrahigh areal capacity of 50 mAh cm-2. In situ and ex situ characterizations and density functional theory simulation analyses prove that V2CTx with abundant sodiophilic functional groups can effectively guide the sodium metal nucleation and uniform deposition, thus enabling a dendrite-free morphology. Moreover, a full cell pairing a Na@V2CTx/rGO-CNT anode with a Na3V2(PO4)3@C-rGO cathode can deliver a high reversible capacity of 86.27 mAh g-1 after 400 cycles at 100 mA g-1. This work not only clarifies the superior Na deposition chemistry on the sodiophilic V2CTx/rGO-CNT microgrid aerogel electrode but also offers an approach for fabricating advanced Na metal anodes via a 3D printing method.",

        "abstract": "The shortage of high-capacity anode materials with long cycling stability is the main roadblock to the development of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The advantages of transition metal selenides are high theoretical capacity, safety and ease of design, which gradually make them potential substitute materials for the anodes of a new generation of SIBs. However, the low intrinsic conductivity of transition metal selenides and the serious powderization during charge and discharge processes restrict their rate performance and cycling stability in SIBs. Herein, bimetallic selenide ZnSe/MoSe2@NC is fabricated by in situ selenation of a rhombic dodecahedron structured metal-organic framework (MOF) containing Zn/Mo salt. Such a heterojunction and structural regulation effectively promote sodium ion transportation. Furthermore, the porous and hierarchical ZnSe/MoSe2@NC is capable of adapting to the volume stress generated by sodium ion (de)insertion. Specifically, in SIB half-cell measurement, a comparable capacity of 401.8 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 1 A g-1 can be achieved by ZnSe/MoSe2@NC. Additionally, the ZnSe/MoSe2@NC polyhedron delivers a high capacity of 345.7 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1 (1500 cycles). Electrochemical kinetics analysis is performed in detail. In SIB full battery applications, the cell shows an impressive energy density of 175.1 W h kg-1. This research broadens the development prospect of transition metal selenides as anodes in SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Non-uniform zinc plating/stripping in aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) often leads to dendrites formation and low Coulombic efficiency (CE), limiting their large-scale application. In this study, a pre-corroded Zn (PC-Zn) anode with 3D ridge-like structure is constructed by a facile solution etching in sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2) solution. The surface preparation process can significantly remove impurities from the passivation layer of bare Zn anode, thus exposing a great quantity of active sites for easy plating/stripping. Moreover, the pre-corroded structure enables a uniform-distributed electric field to promote the 3D Zn2+ diffusion process and accelerate the transfer kinetics, thereby suppressing the zinc dendrites and interfacial side reactions. Consequently, symmetric cells with PC-Zn electrodes demonstrate remarkable stability, maintaining cycles for over 3200 h under 1 mA cm-2. The PC-Zn/VO2 full cell maintains a specific capacity of 361 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, and a capacity retention rate of ≈80% over 1000 cycles at 4 A g-1. Notably, no obvious dendrites and side reactions are detected after extended cycling. Leveraging the cost-effectiveness, environmentally friendly nature, and easy fabrication of the PC-Zn electrode, this Zn protection strategy holds promise for advancing the industrial application of ZIBs.",

        "abstract": "The significance of exploring optimal electrode materials cannot be overstated, particularly in mitigating the critical issues posed by sluggish redox kinetics, significant volume variations, and severe structural collapse resulting from the insertion and extraction of sodium ions. These efforts are crucial for enhancing the longevity and rapid charging capabilities of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a defect engineering strategy for the in situ encapsulation of single‐phase ternary iron phosphoselenide into porous carbon by robust chemical bonds with the formation of rod‐like multicavity nanohybrids (FePSe3@C) is presented. The incorporation of Se atom not only modulates the electronic structure of the central metal Fe atom and enhances the intrinsic electrical conductivity, but also generates numerous additional reaction sites and accelerates the reaction kinetics of FePSe3@C, as corroborated by theoretical calculations and kinetic analysis. Notably, the FePSe3@C demonstrates an outstanding rate capability of 321.7 mAh g−1 even at 20 A g−1 and long cycling stability over 1000 cycles. The sodium‐ion full cell, pairing the FePSe3@C anode with the Na3V2(PO4)3@C cathode, exhibits a remarkable energy density of 202 Wh kg−1, demonstrating its practical applicability.

Herein, a novel multifunctional separator with lightweight and high thinness is proposed, assembled by the cobalt‐based metal–organic framework nanowires (Co‐NWS), to replace the widely applied thick and heavy glass fiber separator. Benefitting from its abundant sodiophilic functional groups and densely stacked nanowires, Co‐NWS not only exhibits outstanding electrolyte wettability and effectively induces uniform Na+ ion flux as a strong ion redistributor but also favors constructing the robust N,F‐rich SEI layer. Satisfactorily, with 10 µL carbonate electrolyte, a Na|Co‐NWS|Cu half‐cell delivers stable cycling (over 260 cycles) with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 98%, and the symmetric cell shows a long cycle life of more than 500 h.

Herein, a carbon-decorated MoS2/CoS heterostructure on carbon cloth (MoS2/CoS@CC) as a free-standing anode for SIBs was synthesized via a facile growth-carbonization strategy. In the composite, the generated built-in electric field at MoS2 and CoS heterointerfaces is beneficial for elevating the electron conductivity, thus expediting the Na-ion transport rate. Moreover, different redox potentials between MoS2 and CoS can effectively mitigate the mechanical strain induced by repeated Na+ de-/intercalation, thus ensuring the structural integrity. In addition, the carbon skeleton derived from the carbonization of glucose can enhance the conductivity of the electrode and maintain the structural integrity. Consequently, the resulting MoS2/CoS@CC electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 605 mA h g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 after 100 cycles, and prominent rate performance (366 mA h g-1 at 8.0 A g-1).

        "title": "Enhanced Sodium Ion Storage in Interlayer Expanded Multiwall Carbon Nanotubes.",
        "abstract": "We report an effective approach of utilizing multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as an active anode material in sodium ion batteries by expanding the interlayer distance in a few outer layers of multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The performance enhancement was investigated using a density functional tight binding (DFTB) molecular dynamics simulation. It is found that a sodium atom forms a stable bonding with the partially expanded MWCNT (PECNT) with the binding energy of -1.50 eV based on the density functional theory calculation with van der Waals correction, where a sodium atom is caged between the two carbon hexagons in the two consecutive MWCNTs. Wave function and charge density analyses show that this binding is physisorption in nature. This larger exothermic nature of binding energy favors the stable bonding between the PECNT and a sodium atom, and thereby, it helps to enhance the electrochemical performance. In the experimental works, partial opening of the MWCNT with the expanded interlayer has been designed by the well-known Hummer's method. It has been found that the introduction of functional groups causes a partial opening of the outer few layers of a MWCNT, with the inner core remaining undisturbed. The enhanced performance is due to an expanded interlayer of carbon nanotubes, which provide sufficient active sites for the sodium ions to adsorb as well as to intercalate into the carbon structure. The PECNT shows a high specific capacity of 510 mAh g-1 at a current density of 20 mA g-1, which is about 2.3 times the specific capacity obtained for a pristine MWCNT at the same current density. This specific capacity is higher when compared to other carbon-based materials. The PECNT also shows a satisfactory cyclic stability at a current density of 200 mA g-1 for 100 cycles. Based on our experimental and theoretical results, an alternative perspective for the storage of sodium ions in MWCNTs is proposed.",

        "abstract": "Electrochemical conversion reactions of metal oxides provide a new avenue to build high capacity anodes for sodium-ion batteries. However, the poor rate performance and cyclability of these conversion anodes remain a significant challenge for Na-ion battery applications because most of the conversion anodes suffer from sluggish kinetics and irreversible structural change during cycles. In this paper, we report an Fe2O3 single crystallites/reduced graphene oxide composite (Fe2O3/rGO), where the Fe2O3 single crystallites with a particle size of ∼300 nm were uniformly anchored on the rGO nanosheets, which provide a highly conductive framework to facilitate electron transport and a flexible matrix to buffer the volume change of the material during cycling. This Fe2O3/rGO composite anode shows a very high reversible capacity of 610 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1, a high Coulombic efficiency of 71% at the first cycle, and a strong cyclability with 82% capacity retention after 100 cycles, suggesting a potential feasibility for sodium-ion batteries. More significantly, the present work clearly illustrates that an electrochemical conversion anode can be made with high capacity utilization, strong rate capability, and stable cyclability through appropriately tailoring the lattice structure, particle size, and electronic conduction channels for a simple transition-metal oxide, thus offering abundant selections for development of low-cost and high-performance Na-storage electrodes.",

After successive carbonization and oxidation treatments, hierarchical NiO/Ni nanocrystals covered with a graphene shell were obtained with the hollow ball-in-ball nanostructure intact. The resulting materials exhibited superior performance as the anode in lithium ion batteries (LIBs): they provide high reversible specific capacity (1144 mAh/g), excellent cyclability (nearly no capacity loss after 1000 cycles) and rate performance (805 mAh/g at 15 A/g). In addition, the hierarchical NiO/Ni/Graphene composites demonstrated promising performance as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Such a superior lithium and sodium storage performance is derived from the well-designed hierarchical hollow ball-in-ball structure of NiO/Ni/Graphene composites, which not only mitigates the volume expansion of NiO during the cycles but also provides a continuous highly conductive graphene matrix to facilitate the fast charge transfer and form a stable SEI layer.",

        "abstract": "As a promising anode material for Na‐metal batteries, the practical application of Na metal is severely hindered due to the formation of the notorious dendrite and unstable solid‐electrolyte interface (SEI). To address these issues, a direct‐ink writing (DIW) 3D printing technology is proposed to construct an artificial 3D hierarchical porous sodiophilic Nb2CTx/reduced graphene‐oxide (Nb2CTx/rGO) aerogel monolith, which is employed as the matrix of Na metal anode. Benefiting from the homogeneous ion flux and exceptional sodiophilic features, the Nb2CTx nanoflakes embedded within the 3D scaffold regulate the uniform deposition of metallic Na with a stable SEI layer, achieving an ultralong cycle lifespan of 3000 h at 1 mA cm−2 with 1 mAh cm−2 and an impressive Coulombic efficiency of 99.68% over extended lifespan of 7064 h. Further, the in‐depth characterization analysis proves that the formed stable SEI layer consists of an inorganic NaF accumulated in the inner layer and loosely‐bound organic species in the outer layer. Remarkably, when integrated into a Na metal full cell, the reversible capacity reaches 90.22 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at 100 mA g−1. The work provides a promising strategy to utilize Na metal anodes with long cycle lifespan for next‐generation sodium metal batteries.",

Moreover, it exhibits excellent great rate capability with 589 mAh g -1 for Li + and 296 mAh g -1 at 5 A g -1 for Na + . The enhanced Li/Na storage properties of the nanocomposites are not only attributed to the increase in conductivity caused by V O /V S and F doping (confirmed by DFT calculations) to accelerate their charge-transfer kinetics but also the increased interaction between F-SnO 2-x -SnS 2-x and Li/Na through heterostructure. Meanwhile, the hierarchical F-SnO 2-x -SnS 2-x @N/S-RGO network structure enables fast infiltration of electrolyte and improves electron/ion transportation in the electrode, and the corrosion resistance of F doping contributes to prolonged cycle stability.",

        "abstract": "Si has the highest theoretical capacity (4200 mA h g-1) among conventional anode materials, such as graphite (372 mA h g-1), but its large volume expansion leads to deterioration of the battery performance. To overcome this problem (issue), we investigated the use of polysaccharide-based 3D cross-linked network binders for Si anodes, in which the polysaccharide formed an effective 3D cross-linked network around Si particles via cross-linking of polysaccharide with citric acid (CA). Sodium alginate (SA), a natural polysaccharide extracted from brown algae, is a suitable binder material for Si anodes because its abundant hydroxyl (-OH) and carboxyl (-COOH) groups form hydrogen and covalent bonds with the -OH groups present on the Si surface. We found that CA-cross-linked (CA-SA) could effectively prevent the volume expansion of Si anodes through the formation of 3D cross-linked network structures. In addition, the CA-SA binders provide enhanced adhesion strength, enabling the fabrication of more robust electrodes than those prepared using binders with linear structures (\"linear binders\"). In particular, the fabricated Si-based electrode (high mass loading of 1.5 mg cm-2) with CA-SA binder exhibited outstanding areal capacity (∼2.7 mA h cm-2) and excellent cycle retention (∼100% after 100 cycles).",

However, transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) anodes show unsatisfactory Na+ electrochemical performance owing to the low intrinsic conductivity and inferior ion transport kinetics. Here, an elaborate design is developed to prepare a composite of WSSe nanosheets supported on a 3D cross-networked porous carbon skeleton (WSSe@CPCS), which possesses en-rich anion vacancies and WSSe with expanded inter-layer spacing, as well as an interconnected porous structure. As a result, the WSSe@CPCS anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) exhibits preeminent reversible capacities, excellent cycle stability, and superior rate capability. The systematic electrochemical kinetic analysis and density functional theory results further show that the effect of anion vacancies and CPCS synergistically enhances the conductivity and reduces charge transfer resistance, thus making a great contribution to fast reaction kinetics. Finally, the implementations of the WSSe@CPCS anode in progressive SIB and DIB full-cell configurations exhibit satisfactory performance, which reveals their widely practical application. This research will provide an exciting approach to designing advanced defect-structured tungsten-based TMD materials for SIBs, DIBs, and even a broad range of energy storage.",

The rational structures can provide convenient channels to facilitate ions/electrons transport and improve the capacitive contributions. Moreover, the phosphorus-doping-induced surface vacancies not only provide more active sites but also improve the intrinsic electrical conductivity of Na2Ti3O7, which will enable the electrode materials with excellent sodium storage performance.

Currently, the challenge of the NIB development is due primarily to the lack of a high-performance anode, while the Na metal anode holds great promise considering its highest specific capacity of 1165 mA h/g and lowest anodic potential. However, an uneven deposit, relatively infinite volume change, and dendritic growth upon plating/stripping cycles cause a low Coulombic efficiency, poor cycling performance, and severe safety concerns. Here, a stable Na carbonized wood (Na-wood) composite anode was fabricated via a rapid melt infusion (about 5 s) into channels of carbonized wood by capillary action. The channels function as a high-surface-area, conductive, mechanically stable skeleton, which lowers the effective current density, ensures a uniform Na nucleation, and restricts the volume change over cycles. As a result, the Na-wood composite anode exhibited flat plating/stripping profiles with smaller overpotentials and stable cycling performance over 500 h at 1.0 mA/cm2 in a common carbonate electrolyte system. In sharp comparison, the planar Na metal electrode showed a much shorter cycle life of 100 h under the same test conditions.",

Additionally, polar polymer chains consisting of polyethersulfone and polyvinylidene customize the highly aggregated solvation structure of electrolytes via substantial solvent immobilization, facilitating ion‐conductivity‐enhanced inorganic‐rich solid‐electrolyte interphase with remarkable interface endurance. With the reliable mechanical strength of the separator, the assembled sodium‐ion full cell delivers significantly improved energy density and high safety, enabling stable operation under cutting and rolling. The as‐prepared separator can further be generalized to lithium‐based batteries for which apparent dendrite inhibition and cyclability are accessible and demonstrates its potential for practical application.",

        "abstract": "Developing hard carbon with a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and very good cycling stability is of great importance for practical sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Defects and oxygen-containing groups grown along either the carbon edges or the layers, however, are inevitable in hard carbon and can cause a tremendous density of irreversible Na+ sites, decreasing the efficiency and therefore causing failure of the battery. Thus, eliminating these unexpected defect structures is significant for enhancing the battery performance. Herein, we develop a strategy of applying a soft-carbon coating onto free-standing hard-carbon electrodes, which greatly hinders the formation of defects and oxygen-containing groups on hard carbon. The electrochemical results show that the soft-carbon-coated, free-standing hard-carbon electrodes can achieve an ultrahigh ICE of 94.1% and long cycling performance (99% capacity retention after 100 cycles at a current density of 20 mA g-1), demonstrating their great potential in practical sodium storage systems. The sodium storage mechanism was also investigated by operando Raman spectroscopy. Our sodium storage mechanism extends the \"adsorption-intercalation-pore filling-deposition\" model. We propose that the pore filling in the plateau area might be divided into two parts: (1) sodium could fill in the pores near the inner wall of the carbon layer; (2) when the sodium in the inner wall pores is close to saturation, the sodium could be further deposited onto the existing sodium.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been extensively studied owing to the abundance and low-price of Na resources. However, the infeasibility of graphite and silicon electrodes in sodium-ion storage makes it urgent to develop high-performance anode materials. Herein, α-MnSe nanorods derived from δ-MnO2 (δ-α-MnSe) are constructed as anodes for SIBs. It is verified that α-MnSe will be transferred into β-MnSe after the initial Na-ion insertion/extraction, and δ-α-MnSe undergoes typical conversion mechanism using a Mn-ion for charge compensation in the subsequent charge-discharge process. First-principles calculations support that Na-ion migration in defect-free α-MnSe can drive the lattice distortion to phase transition (alpha → beta) in thermodynamics and dynamics. The formed β-MnSe with robust lattice structure and small Na-ion diffusion barrier boosts great structure stability and electrochemical kinetics. Hence, the δ-α-MnSe electrode contributes excellent rate capability and superior cyclic stability with long lifespan over 1000 cycles and low decay rate of 0.0267% per cycle. Na-ion full batteries with a high energy density of 281.2 Wh·kg-1 and outstanding cyclability demonstrate the applicability of δ-α-MnSe anode.",

        "abstract": "There are only a handful of reports on indium sulfide (In2S3) in the electrochemical energy storage field without a clear electrochemical reaction mechanism. In this work, a simple electrospinning method has been used to synthesize In2S3/C nanofibers for the first time. In lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the In2S3/C nanofiber electrode can not only deliver a high initial reversible specific capacity of 696.4 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1, but also shows ultra-long cycle life with a capacity retention of 80.5% after 600 cycles at 1000 mA g-1. In sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), the In2S3/C nanofibers electrode can exhibit a high initial reversible specific capacity (393.7 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1) and excellent cycling performance with a high capacity retention of 97.3% after 300 cycles at 1000 mA g-1. The excellent electrochemical properties mainly benefited from In2S3 being encapsulated by a carbon matrix, which buffers the volume expansion and significantly improves the conductivity of the composite. Furthermore, the structural evolution of In2S3 during the first lithiation/delithiation and sodiation/desodiation processes has been illustrated by ex situ XRD. The results confirm that the reaction mechanism of In2S3 in both LIBs and SIBs can be summarized as conversion reactions and alloying reactions, which provide theoretical support for the development of In2S3 in the field of electrochemistry.",

However, the sodium polysulfide shuttle effect and dendritic growth pose significant challenges to their practical applications. In this study, we apply diverse disciplinary backgrounds to introduce a novel method to stimulate polarized BaTiO3 (BTO) nanoparticles on the separator. This approach generates more charges due to the piezoelectric effect under stronger driving forces produced by applying a controllable acoustic field at the outer edge of the cell. The acoustically stimulated BTO attracts more polysulfides, thus reducing the shuttling effect from the cathode to the anode and ultimately enhancing the battery performance. Meanwhile, the acoustic waves create additional streaming flows, improving the uniformity of the sodium ion dispersion, enhancing the sodium ion transport and reducing the possibility of sodium dendrite development. We believe that this work offers a new strategy for the development of high-performance Na–S batteries.",

        "abstract": "Owing to several advantages of metallic sodium (Na), such as a relatively high theoretical capacity, low redox potential, wide availability, and low cost, Na metal batteries are being extensively studied, which are expected to play a major role in the fields of electric vehicles and grid-scale energy storage. Although considerable efforts have been devoted to utilizing MXene-based materials for suppressing Na dendrites, achieving a stable cycling of Na metal anodes remains extremely challenging due to, for example, the low Coulombic efficiency (CE) caused by the severe side reactions. Herein, a g-C3N4 layer was attached in situ on the Ti3C2 MXene surface, inducing a surface state reconstruction and thus forming a stable hetero-interphase with excellent sodiophilicity between the MXene and g-C3N4 to inhibit side reactions and guide uniform Na ion flux. The 3D construction can not only lower the local current density to facilitate uniform Na plating/stripping but also mitigate volume change to stabilize the electrolyte/electrode interphase. Thus, the 3D Ti3C2 MXene@g-C3N4 nanocomposite enables much enhanced average CEs (99.9% at 1 mA h cm-2, 0.5 mA cm-2) in asymmetric half cells, long-term stability (up to 700 h) for symmetric cells, and stable cycling (up to 800 cycles at 2 C), together with outstanding rate capability (up to 20 C), of full cells. The present study demonstrates an approach in developing practically high performance for Na metal anodes.",

HNFBs are composed of a molten Na-Cs alloy anode, flowing aqueous catholyte, and a Na-β″-Al2O3 solid electrolyte as the separator. The surface functionalization of graphite felt electrodes for the flowing aqueous catholyte has been studied for its effectiveness in enhancing V(2+)/V(3+), V(3+)/V(4+), and V(4+)/V(5+) redox couples. The V(4+)/V(5+) redox reaction has been further investigated at different cell operation temperatures for its cyclic stability and how the properties of the solid electrolyte membrane play a role in cycling. These fundamental understandings provide guidelines for improving the cyclic performance and stability of HNFBs with aqueous catholytes. We show that the HNFB with aqueous V-ion catholyte can reach high storage capacity (∼70% of the theoretical capacity) with good Coulombic efficiency (90% ± 1% in 2-30 cycles) and cyclic performance (>99% capacity retention for 30 cycles). It demonstrates, for the first time, the potential of high capacity HNFBs with aqueous catholytes, good capacity retention and long cycling life.

Alloy-type anode materials for sodium-ion batteries are esteemed as prospective candidate materials for sodium-ion anodes, owing to their elevated theoretical capacity, heightened utilization efficiency, and minimal production of insulating byproducts.

Additionally, repetitive volume changes can cause an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). This study presents the synthesis of chloride-ion-modulated bimetallic SnSb/C nanoparticle anode materials, highlighting the following advantages: (i) Designing a bimetallic SnSb alloy structure serves to buffer the structural stresses generated during sodium insertion/extraction processes, effectively mitigating particle fracture phenomena induced by electrode material expansion/contraction. (ii) Nanostructuring both alloy materials enables the full utilization of active materials and shortens diffusion pathways, thereby significantly enhancing the diffusion rate of sodium ions. (iii) Introducing a carbonaceous matrix serves to alleviate self-agglomeration phenomena of the material during charge/discharge cycles, enhancing the material's conductivity and structural stability.

Herein, the red P is successfully encapsulated into the cube shaped sandwich-like interconnected porous carbon building (denoted as P@C-GO/MOF-5) via the vaporization-condensation method. Superior cycling stability (high capacity retention of about 93% at 2 A g-1 after 100 cycles) and excellent rate performance (502 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 ) can be obtained for the P@C-GO/MOF-5 electrode. The superior electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the successful incorporation of red P into the unique carbon matrix with large surface area and pore volume, interconnected porous structure, excellent electronic conductivity and superior structural stability.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries offer an attractive option for grid-level energy storage due to the high natural abundance of sodium and low material cost of sodium compounds. Phosphorus (P) is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries, with a theoretical capacity of 2596 mAh/g. The red phosphorus (RP) form has worse electronic conductivity and lower initial Coulombic efficiency than black phosphorus (BP), but high material cost and limited production capacity have slowed the development of BP anodes. To address these challenges, we have developed a simple and scalable method to synthesize layered BP/graphene composite (BP/rGO) by pressurization at room temperature. A carbon-black-free and binder-free BP/rGO anode prepared with this method achieved specific charge capacities of 1460.1, 1401.2, 1377.6, 1339.7, 1277.8, 1123.78, and 720.8 mAh/g in a rate capability test at charge and discharge current densities of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, and 40 A/g, respectively. In a cycling performance test, after 500 deep cycles, the capacity of BP/rGO anodes stabilized at 1250 and 640 mAh/g at 1 and 40 A/g, respectively, which marks a significant performance improvement for sodium-ion battery anodes.",

However, they usually exhibit inferior thermodynamic stability and sluggish Na+ kinetics due to the unwanted phase transitions and large Na+-ionic radius. In this work, considering the beneficial synergistic effects of layered P2/P3 and Fd3[combining macron]m spinel phases, a stable layered/spinel intergrowth nanocomposite Na0.5[Ni0.2Co0.15Mn0.65]O2 is rationally designed and successfully prepared via a co-precipitation route and a subsequent solid-state reaction, and the triphase synergy in this layered/spinel nanocomposite is demonstrated. In Na/Na0.5[Ni0.2Co0.15Mn0.65]O2 half-cells, it delivers a high specific capacity of ∼180 mA h g-1 and a good cycling stability, with a capacity retention of 87.6% after 100 cycles, at a rate of 0.1C between 1.5 and 4.0 V (vs. Na/Na+). The large reversible capacity of 105 mA h g-1 is also achieved even at a high rate of 10C, indicating high-rate capability. Besides, the full-cells using this nanocomposite as the cathode and hard carbon as the anode exhibit long-term cycle-life and high-power properties, indicating the expected merits of layered/spinel mixed phases. The superior sodium storage performance of this layered P3/P2 and spinel intergrowth nanocomposite makes it a promising candidate as a long-life and high-rate cathode for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Electrochemical ion storage behaviors of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, as a representative transition metal oxide for an environmentally benign and low-cost anode for a sodium-ion battery, are thoroughly investigated through a combination of electrochemical analysis and diagnostics of Fe3O4 electrode cells, X-ray-based and spectroscopic analysis of material structure evolution as functions of depth of discharge (DoD) and state of charge (SoC), and first principle modeling. The gravimetric capacity is found to be 50 mA h/g for bulk Fe3O4 (50 nm average crystallite size) and 100 mA h/g─about a tenth of the theoretical prediction for complete conversion─for Fe3O4 nanoparticles (8.7 nm average particle size), respectively. A fundamental and mechanistic study of material evolution as functions of DoD and SoC shows that Fe3O4 does not allow electrochemical incorporation of Na+ ions into the empty cation positions of the inverse spinel structure, leading to our assertion that electrochemical intercalation of Na+ ions to conversion of the Fe3O4 anode in sodium-ion batteries is nonviable. A density functional theory investigation points to the impracticality of the intercalation of Na+ ions into Fe3O4 and further validates our experimental findings. We propose several possible mechanisms corresponding to the observed low capacity, including formation of solid electrolyte interphases with unfavorable properties and adsorption of Na+ ions onto surfaces of nanoparticles and/or at heterointerfaces in Fe3O4 composite electrodes in a NaPF6-based electrolyte system.",

However, its development is hampered by the limited metallic utilization and detrimental sodium dendrite growth ascribed to the unstable, and fragile solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Here, the high stable and modulus SEI is constructed with a component of a thin and dense layer of high Na‐ion conductive Na2SiO3. It is in situ formed by the reaction between sodium anode and fish‐skin structure separator, which exhibits a 3D porous polyvinylidene fluoride‐based framework embedded with thin and robust vermiculite sheets. The robust interphase cannot only suppress sodium dendrite growth but also enable high energy density with small interphase‐consumed Na ions in anode‐less batteries. Accordingly, the as‐assembled NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2//Na cell shows 83% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at a rate of 5 °C. Moreover, the proof‐of‐concept pouch cells deliver an energy density of 205 Wh kg−1 (based on the total mass of the battery), and high safety (not catching fire after punctured) under anode‐less condition (with a low negative/positive capacity ratio of ≈2.1).",

Here, a dual-carbon conductive network enhanced GeP5 (GeP5/acetylene black/partially reduced graphene oxide sheets (GeP5/AB/p-rGO)) composite is successfully prepared by a facile ball milling method. The dual-carbon network not only provides more transport pathways for electrons but also relaxes the huge volume change of the electrode material during the charge/discharge process. Compared with only AB- or GO-modified GeP5 (GeP5/AB or GeP5/GO) composite, the GeP5/AB/p-rGO composite shows a superior sodium storage performance with an excellent rate and cycle performance. It delivers a high reversible capacity of 597.5 and 175 mAh/g at the current density of 0.1 and 5.0 A/g, respectively. Furthermore, at the current density of 0.5 A/g, the GeP5/AB/p-rGO composite shows the reversible capacity of 400 mAh/g after 50 cycles with a little capacity attenuation.

The sodium storage capacity of this material is primarily attributed to a combined adsorption‐intercalation/filling effect as confirmed by in situ XRD and ex situ Raman analyses.

Herein, with the assistance of a simple calcination method and common raw materials, the environmentally friendly and nontoxic N‐doped C@Zn3B2O6 composite is directly synthesized and proved to be a potential anode material for NIBs. The composite demonstrates a high reversible charge capacity of 446.2 mAh g−1 and a safe and suitable average voltage of 0.69 V, together with application potential in full cells (discharge capacity of 98.4 mAh g−1 and long cycle performance of 300 cycles at 1000 mA g−1). In addition, the sodium‐ion storage mechanism of N‐doped C@Zn3B2O6 is subsequently studied through air‐insulated ex situ characterizations of X‐ray diffraction (XRD), X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier‐transform infrared (FT‐IR) spectroscopy, and is found to be rather different from previous reports on borate anode materials for NIBs and lithium‐ion batteries. The reaction mechanism is deduced and proposed as: Zn3B2O6 + 6Na+ + 6e− ⇋ 3Zn + B2O3 ∙ 3Na2O, which indicates that the generated boracic phase is electrochemically active and participates in the later discharge/charge progress.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfide‐based anodes usually suffer from huge volumetric change and sluggish reaction kinetics, hindering their application for long‐term and high‐power/energy sodium‐ion batteries. Herein, a new design of CoS2‐xSex (0≤x≤2) nanocrystals with highly controllable selenium substitution and S, Se‐codoped graphene immobilization (CoS2‐xSex@SG) is proposed to tune the reaction kinetics and structural stability. The nanocrystal‐on‐graphene structure and robust C─S &C─Se bonding rivets between CoS2‐xSex and SG greatly improve the structural stability of the CoS2‐xSex@SG. Electrochemical performance, kinetic analysis, and theoretical calculation reveal that Se substitution plays a double‐edged role in sodium storage: the increase of Se substitution content enhances the Na+ diffusion kinetics but decreases the Na‐storage capacity. When the Se substitution content is 0.4, the CoS1.6Se0.4@SG electrode demonstrates the best performance: high initial Coulombic efficiency (95.5%), ultrahigh rate capability (412.8 mAh g−1 at 30 A g−1), and ultra‐stable cycling performance (97.6% capacity retention after 1000 cycles). In situ/ex situ measurements further unveil that the conversion reaction between Co0 and Na2S/Na2Se generates the micro‐scaled CoSe2–CoS2 heterostructure, synergistically improving the Na‐storage active sites and reaction kinetics.

The CuS nanoparticles are distributed evenly in the exfoliated g-C3N4 matrix rendering higher electronic conductivity and space for volume alterations during the repeated discharge/charge cycles. The 0.8CuS:0.2g-C3N4 composite when used as an anode for lithium ion coin cell exhibits a reversible capacity of 478.4 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 2.0 A g−1 after a run of 1000 cycles which is better than that reported for CuS composites with any other carbon-based matrix. The performance is equally impressive when 0.8CuS:0.2g-C3N4 composite is used as an anode in a sodium ion coin cell and a reversible capacity of 408 mA h g−1 is obtained at a current rate of 2.0 A g−1 after a run of 800 cycles. A sodium ion full cell with NVP cathode and 0.8CuS:0.2g-C3N4 composite anode has been fabricated and cycled for 100 runs at a current rate of 0.1 A g−1.

        "abstract": "Alloying-type antimony (Sb) with high theoretical capacity is a promising anode candidate for both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Given the larger radius of Na+ (1.02 Å) than Li+ (0.76 Å), it was generally believed that the Sb anode would experience even worse capacity degradation in SIBs due to more substantial volumetric variations during cycling when compared to LIBs. However, the Sb anode in SIBs unexpectedly exhibited both better electrochemical and structural stability than in LIBs, and the mechanistic reasons that underlie this performance discrepancy remain undiscovered. Here, using substantial in situ transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman techniques complemented by theoretical simulations, we explicitly reveal that compared to lithiation/delithiation process, sodiation/desodiation process of Sb anode displays a previously unexplored two-stage alloying/dealloying mechanism with polycrystalline and amorphous phases as the intermediates featuring improved resilience to mechanical damage, contributing to superior cycling stability in SIBs. Additionally, the better mechanical properties and weaker atomic interaction of Na-Sb alloys than Li-Sb alloys favor enabling mitigated mechanical stress, accounting for enhanced structural stability as unveiled by theoretical simulations. Our finding delineates the mechanistic origins of enhanced cycling stability of Sb anode in SIBs with potential implications for other large-volume-change electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "Carbon-encapsulated Sn@N-doped carbon tubes with submicron diameters were obtained via the simple reduction of C@SnO2@N-doped carbon composites that were fabricated by a hydrothermal approach. Sn nanoparticles encapsulated in carbon layers were distributed uniformly on the surfaces of the N-doped carbon nanotubes. The electrochemical performances of the composites were systematically investigated as anode materials in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The composite electrode could attain a good reversible capacity of 398.4 mAh g-1 when discharging at 100 mA g-1, with capacity retention of 67.3% and very high Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% over 150 cycles. This good cycling performance, when compared to only 17.5 mAh g-1 delivered by bare Sn particles prepared via the same method without the presence of N-doped carbon, could be mainly ascribed to the uniform distribution of the precursor SnO2 on the substrate of N-doped carbon tubes with three-dimensional structure, which provides more reaction sites to reduce the diffusion distance of Na+, further facilitating Na+-ion diffusion and relieves the huge volume expansion during charging/discharging. These outcomes imply that such a Sn/C composite would provide more options as an anode candidate for SIBs.",

The major challenges of anode lie in poor cycling stability and the sluggish kinetics attributed to the inherent large Na+ size. In this work, Bi nanosphere encapsulated in N‐doped carbon nanowires (Bi@N‐C) is assembled by facile electrospinning and carbonization. N‐doped carbon mitigates the structure stress/strain during alloying/dealloying, optimizes the ionic/electronic diffusion, and provides fast electron transfer and structural stability. Due to the excellent structure, Bi@N‐C shows excellent Na storage performance in SIBs in terms of good cycling stability and rate capacity in half cells and full cells. The fundamental mechanism of the outstanding electrochemical performance of Bi@N‐C has been demonstrated through synchrotron in‐situ XRD, atomic force microscopy, ex‐situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Importantly, a deeper understanding of the underlying reasons of the performance improvement is elucidated, which is vital for providing the theoretical basis for application of SIBs.",

Herein, a general and scalable solvent-exchange strategy is presented for uniform dispersion of few-layer MoS2 (f-MoS2 ) from high-boiling-point solvents (N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), N,N-dimethyl formaldehyde (DMF), etc.) into low-boiling-point solvents (water, ethanol, etc.). The solvent-exchange strategy dramatically simplifies high-yield production of dispersible MoS2 nanosheets as well as facilitates subsequent decoration of MoS2 for various applications. As a demonstration, MoS2 -decorated nitrogen-rich carbon spheres (MoS2 -NCS) are prepared via in situ growth of polypyrrole and subsequent pyrolysis. Benefiting from its ultrathin feature, largely exposed active surface, highly conductive framework and excellent structural integrity, the 2D core-shell architecture of MoS2 -NCS exhibits an outstanding reversible capacity and excellent cycling performance, achieving high initial discharge capacity of 1087.5 and 508.6 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 , capacity retentions of 95.6% and 94.2% after 500 and 250 charge/discharge cycles at 1 A g-1 , for lithium/sodium ion storages, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Autonomic self-healing (SH), namely, the ability to repair damages from mechanical stress spontaneously, is polarizing attention in the field of new-generation electrochemical devices. This property is highly attractive to enhance the durability of rechargeable Li-ion batteries (LIBs) or Na-ion batteries (SIBs), where high-performing anode active materials (silicon, phosphorus, etc.) are strongly affected by volume expansion and phase changes upon ion insertion. Here, we applied a SH strategy, based on the dynamic quadruple hydrogen bonding, to nanosized black phosphorus (BP) anodes for Na-ion cells. The goal is to overcome drastic capacity decay and short lifetime, resulting from mechanical damages induced by the volumetric expansion/contraction upon sodiation/desodiation. Specifically, we developed novel ureidopyrimidinone (UPy)-telechelic systems and related blends with poly(ethylene oxide) as novel and green binders alternative to the more conventional ones, such as polyacrylic acid and carboxymethylcellulose, which are typically used in SIBs. BP anodes show impressively improved (more than 6 times) capacity retention when employing the new SH polymeric blend. In particular, the SH electrode still works at a current density higher than 3.5 A g–1, whereas the standard BP electrode exhibits very poor performances already at current densities lower than 0.5 A g–1. This is the result of better adhesion, buffering properties, and spontaneous damage reparation.",

The TiO2/C nanofiber with plasma treatment could deliver a high redox capacity of 191 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at a very high rate of 10C (3300 mA g−1).

However, the practical application of SIBs is severely hindered by limited electrode materials. Disordered carbons are reported to be promising as anode materials for SIBs. Here, for the first time, calcium lignosulfonate (LSCa), one papermaking waste, is explored as a novel low‐cost precursor for carbon materials of SIBs. The optimized LSCa‐derived carbon delivers a high reversible capacity of 317 mA h g−1 at 30 mA g−1 with ~60% plateau capacity, and it retains a capacity of 170 mA h g−1 even at 3000 mA g−1. These achievements are ascribed to the larger d002 values, smaller defects, and more closed pores, compared with the original sample from the direct carbonization of LSCa.",

However, their practical application is still hindered by the insufficient reversibility and/or limited cycling stability. Herein, we report a high-performance calcium/sodium-sulfur (Ca/Na-S) hybrid battery enabled by a multi-ion chemistry. The introduction of Na ions in the electrolyte greatly boosts the conversion of Ca polysulfides, which has been verified by theoretical calculation and experimental investigation. Meanwhile, the presence of Ca ions constructs a protective electrostatic shield around the initial protrusions on the Na metal anode without prereduction, thus efficiently suppressing the Na dendrite growth. The as-developed Ca/Na-S cell exhibited a high reversible capacity of 947 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C with long cycle life, clearly demonstrating the feasibility of this multi-ion strategy for developing low-cost non-Li metal-sulfur batteries.",

        "abstract": "Tin oxide (SnO) is considered one of the most promising metal oxides for utilization as anode material in sodium ion batteries (SIBs), because of its ease of synthesis, high specific gravimetric capacity, and satisfactory cycling performance. However, to aim at practical applications, the Coulombic efficiency during cycling needs to be further improved, which requires a deeper knowledge of its working mechanism. Here, a microflower-shaped SnO material is synthesized by means of an ultrafast ionic liquid-assisted microwave method. The as-prepared SnO anode active material exhibits excellent cycling performance, good Coulombic efficiency as well as a large capacity delivered at low potential, which is fundamental to maximize the energy output of SIBs. These overall merits were never reported before for pure SnO anodes (i.e., not in a composite with, for example, graphene). Additionally, by combining ex situ XRD and XPS, it is clearly demonstrated for the first time that the Sn-Na alloy, which is formed during the initial sodium sodiation, desodiates in two successive but fully separated steps. Totally different from the previous report, the pristine SnO phase is not regenerated upon desodiation up to 3 V vs Na/Na+. The newly disclosed reaction route provides an alternative view of the complex reaction mechanism of these families of metal oxides for sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Highly porous carbon materials with a rationally designed pore structure can be utilized as reservoirs for metal or nonmetal components. The use of small-sized metal or metal compound nanoparticles, completely encapsulated by carbon materials, has attracted significant attention as an effective approach to enhancing sodium ion storage properties. These materials have the ability to mitigate structural collapse caused by volume expansion during the charging process, enable short ion transport length, and prevent polysulfide elution. In this study, a concept of highly porous carbon-coated carbon nanotube (CNT) porous microspheres, which serve as excellent reservoir materials is suggested and a porous microsphere is developed by encapsulating iron sulfide nanocrystals within the highly porous carbon-coated CNTs using a sulfidation process. Furthermore, various sulfidation processes to determine the optimal method for achieving complete encapsulation are investigated by comparing the morphologies of diverse iron sulfide-carbon composites. The fully encapsulated structure, combined with the porous carbon, provides ample space to accommodate the significant volume changes during cycling. As a result, the porous iron sulfide-carbon-CNT composite microspheres exhibited outstanding cycling stability (293 mA h g-1 over 600 cycles at 1 A g-1 ) and remarkable rate capability (100 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1 ).",

        "abstract": "Abstract Amorphous carbon holds great promise as anode material for sodium‐ion batteries due to its cost‐effectiveness and good performance. However, its sodium storage mechanism, particularly the insertion process and origin of plateau capacity, remains controversial. Here, an extended adsorption/insertion‐filling sodium storage mechanism is proposed using petroleum coke‐derived amorphous carbon as a multi‐microcrystalline model. Combining in situ X‐ray diffraction, in situ Raman, theoretical calculations, and neutron scattering, the effective storage form and location of sodium ions in amorphous carbon are revealed. The sodium adsorption at defect sites leads to a high‐potential sloping capacity. The sodium insertion process occurs in both the pseudo‐graphite phase (d 002 > 0.370 nm) and graphite‐like phase (0.345 ≤ d 002 < 0.370 nm) rather than the graphite phase, contributing to low‐potential sloping capacity. The sodium filling into accessible closed pores forms quasi‐metallic sodium clusters, contributing to plateau capacity. The threshold of the effective interlayer spacing for sodium insertion is extended to 0.345 nm, breaking the consensus of insertion interlayer threshold and enhancing understanding of closed pore filling. The extended adsorption/insertion‐filling mechanism explains the sodium storage behavior of amorphous carbon with different microstructures, providing theoretical guidance for the rational design of high‐performance amorphous carbon anodes.",

Nevertheless, due to a lack of direct atomistic observation, the detailed understanding of fundamental intercalation behavior and Bi2S3's (de)sodiation mechanisms remains unclear. Here, by employing in situ high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy, consecutive electron diffraction coupled with theoretical calculations, it is not only for the first time identified that Bi2S3 exhibits specific ionic transport pathways preferred to diffuse along the (110) direction instead of the (200) plane, but also tracks their real‐time phase transformations (de)sodiation involving multi‐step crystallographic tuning.

        "abstract": "As a promising pathway toward low-cost, long-duration energy storage, rechargeable sodium batteries are of increasing interest. Batteries that incorporate metallic sodium as anode promise a high theoretical specific capacity of 1166 mAh g-1 , and low reduction potential of -2.71 V. The high reactivity and poor electrochemical reversibility of sodium anodes render sodium metal anode (SMA) cells among the most challenging for practical implementation. Here, the failure mechanisms of Na anodes are investigated and the authors report that loss of morphological control is not the fundamental cause of failure. Rather, it is the inherently poor anchoring/root structure of electrodeposited Na to the electrode substrate that leads to poor reversibility and cell failure. Poorly anchored Na deposits are prone to break away from the current collector, producing orphaning and poor anode utilization. Thin metallic coatings in a range of chemistries are proposed and evaluated as SMA substrates. Based on thermodynamic and ion transport considerations, such substrates undergo reversible alloying reactions with Na and are hypothesized to promote good root growth-regardless of the morphology. Among the various options, Au stands out for its ability to support long Na anode lifetime and high reversibility (Coulombic Efficiency > 98%), for coating thicknesses in the range of 10-1000 nm. As a first step toward evaluating practical utility of the anodes, their performance in Na||SPAN cells with N:P ratio close to 1:1 is evaluated.",

Herein, we demonstrate a stable and high-rate sodium-metal battery enabled by a nonaqueous polyelectrolyte solution composed of a weakly coordinating polyanion-type Na salt, poly[(4-styrenesulfonyl)-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide] (poly(NaSTFSI)) copolymerized with butyl acrylate, in a propylene carbonate solution.

Furthermore, the surface of the Na electrode was modified with polyanion chains anchored via the partial decomposition of the electrolyte. The surface-tethered polyanion layer effectively suppressed the subsequent decomposition of the electrolyte, thereby enabling stable Na deposition/dissolution cycling. Finally, an assembled sodium-metal battery with a Na0.44MnO2 cathode demonstrated an outstanding charge/discharge reversibility (Coulombic efficiency >99.8%) over 200 cycles while also exhibiting a high discharge rate (i.e., 45% capacity retention at 10 mA cm-2).",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have attracted worldwide attention as potential alternatives for large scale stationary energy storage due to the rich reserves and low cost of sodium resources. However, the practical application of sodium-ion batteries is restricted by unsatisfying capacity and poor rate capability. Herein, a novel mechanism of improving both interfacial and surface charge transfer is proposed by fabricating a graphene oxide/SnO2/Co3O4 nanocomposite through a simple hydrothermal method. The formation of heterostructures between ultrafine SnO2 and Co3O4 could enhance the charge transfer of interfaces owing to the internal electric field. The pseudocapacitive effect, which is led by the high specific area and the existence of ultrafine nanoparticles, takes on a feature of fast faradaic surface charge-transfer. Benefiting from the synergistic advantages of the heterostructures and the pseudocapacitive effect, the as-prepared graphene oxide/SnO2/Co3O4 anode achieved a high reversible capacity of 461 mA h g-1 after 80 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g-1. Additionally, at a high current density of 1 A g-1, a high reversible capacity of 241 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles is obtained. A full cell coupled by the as-prepared graphene oxide/SnO2/Co3O4 anode and the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode was also constructed, which exhibited a reversible capacity of 310.3 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 1 A g-1.

        "abstract": "The major difficulties for the development of flexible energy storage batteries lie in the scalable manufacture of high-performance flexible electrodes with bending tolerance. In the present study, large-scale CNT films are prepared by a continuous production method and used to fabricate a self-supported flexible high-capacity conversion anode with ultra-long cycling life by the in situ growth of NiCo2S4 nanosheets tightly anchored on the CNTs. The CNTs produced via such a scalable method have interconnected porous channels, providing a large contact area between the active materials and electrolyte facilitating the electrochemical conversion reaction of NiCo2S4. An ultra-high rate capability is achieved in terms of a capacity of 280 mA h g-1 at 20 A g-1. The interlaced construction of NiCo2S4 nanosheets with CNTs and firm anchoring on the CNT film result in a remarkable ultra-long cyclability of the NiCo2S4/CNT electrode with a capacity retention rate of 96% after 7500 cycles. A flexible full battery device is further established with the NiCo2S4/CNT anode and Na3V2(PO4)3/CNT cathode with the sealed package of PDMS, exhibiting good cycling stability and mechanical durability under different bending states. The present work highlights a scalable flexible battery electrode material, and demonstrates its potential applications in flexible Na-ion batteries.",

        "title": "Co-construction of sulfur vacancies and carbon confinement in V5S8/CNFs to induce an ultra-stable performance for half/full sodium-ion and potassium-ion batteries.",
        "abstract": "The construction of anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) with a high energy and a long lifespan is significant and still challenging. Here, sulfur-defective vanadium sulfide/carbon fiber composites (D-V5S8/CNFs) are designed and fabricated by a facile electrospinning method, followed by sulfuration treatment. The unique architecture, in which V5S8 nanoparticles are confined inside the carbon fiber, provides a short-range channel and abundant adsorption sites for ion storage. Moreover, enlarged interlayer spacings could also alleviate the volume changes, and offer small vdW interactions and ionic diffusion resistance to store more Na and K ions reversibly and simultaneously. The DFT calculations further demonstrate that sulfur defects can effectively facilitate the adsorption behavior of Na+ and K+ and offer low energy barriers for ion intercalation. Taking advantage of the functional integration of these merits, the D-V5S8/CNF anode exhibits excellent storage performance and long-term cycling stability. It reveals a high capacity of 462 mA h g-1 at a current density of 0.2 A g-1 in SIBs, while it is 350 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 in PIBs, as well as admirable long-term cycling characteristics (190 mA h g-1/17 000 cycles/5 A g-1 for SIBs and 165 mA h g-1/3000 cycles/1 A g-1 for PIBs). Practically, full SIBs upon pairing with a Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode also exhibit superior performance.",

        "abstract": "Layered metal sulfides (MoS2, WS2, SnS2, and SnS) offer high potential as advanced anode materials in sodium ion batteries upon integration with highly-conductive graphene materials. However, in addition to being costly and time-consuming, existing strategies for synthesizing sulfides/graphene composites often involve complicated procedures. It is therefore essential to develop a simple yet scalable pathway to construct sulfide/graphene composites for practical applications. Here, we highlight a one-step, template-free, high-throughput “self-bubbling” method for producing MoS2/graphene composites, which is suitable for large-scale production of sulfide/graphene composites. The final product featured MoS2 nanoflakes distributed in three-dimensional macroporous monolithic graphene. Moreover, this unique MoS2/graphene composite achieved remarkable electrochemical performance when being applied to Na-ion battery anodes; namely, excellent cycling stability (474 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles) and high rate capability (406 mA h g−1 at 0.25 A g−1 and 359 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1).

        "abstract": "High-surface-area carbon (HSAC) has been regarded as one of the most promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. However, it generally suffers from low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), which is closely related to the formation process of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Herein, the impact of different electrolyte salts on the electrochemical performance and SEI formation of a commercial HSAC anode is studied. It is found that the use of NaCF3SO3 enables much higher ICE (69.28%) and reversible capacity (283 mA h g-1) of the HSAC anode compared with the NaPF6 electrolyte (59.65%, 243 mA h g-1). Through comprehensive characterizations, the improvement in electrochemical performance facilitated by NaCF3SO3 could be attributed to the reduced amount of NaxC and the thinner SEI formed on the surface of HSAC during the initial cycle, which not only provides extra active sites for Na+ storage but also contributes to the promoted ICE. This work not only provides a deeper understanding of the role of electrolyte salt in SEI formation in the HSAC anode but also proposes a new method to further promote the ICE of the HSAC anode in sodium-ion batteries.",

        "title": "Effect of the Particle-Size Distribution on the Electrochemical Performance of a Red Phosphorus–Carbon Composite Anode for Sodium-Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "Red phosphorus (RP) is a promising candidate as an anode for sodium-ion batteries because of its low potential and high specific capacity. It has two main disadvantages. First, it experiences 490% volumetric expansion during sodiation, which leads to particle pulverization and substantial reduction of the cycle life. Second, it has an extremely low electronic conductivity of 10–14 S cm–1. Both issues can be addressed by ball milling RP with a carbon matrix to form a composite of electronically conductive carbon and small RP particles, less susceptible to pulverization. Through this procedure, however, the resulting particle-size distribution of the RP particles is difficult to determine because of the presence of the carbon particles. Here, we quantify the relationship between the RP particle-size distribution and its cycle life for the first time by separating the ball-milling process into two steps. The RP is first wet-milled to reduce the particle size, and then the particle-size distribution is measured via dynamic light scattering. This is followed by a dry-milling step to produce RP–graphite composites. We found that wet milling breaks apart the largest RP particles in the range of 2–10 μm, decreases the Dv90 from 1.85 to 1.26 μm, and significantly increases the cycle life of the RP. Photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy confirm the successful formation of a carbon coating, with longer milling times leading to more uniform carbon coatings. The RP with a Dv90 of 0.79 μm mixed with graphite for 48 h delivered 1354 mA h g–1 with high coulombic efficiency (>99%) and cyclability (88% capacity retention after 100 cycles). These results are an important step in the development of cyclable, high-capacity anodes for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The stability of aqueous Z inc (Zn) ion energy storage devices is significantly compromised by the instability at the electrode/electrolyte interface, which can result in the growth of Zn dendrites, self‐corrosion, and various other side reactions. Regulating the Zn‐ion （Zn2+) solvation structure through electrolyte additives has been proved to be effective strategy in stabilizing the Zn anode, but the influence of free water on the solvation structure is often lacking in‐depth exploration. Herein, the piperazine‐N,N‐bis(2‐hydroxypropanesulfonic acid) sodium salt (POPSO‐Na) is presented as a multifunctional electrolyte additive, which enhances the stability of the Zn anode by modulating the deposition and stripping environment of Zn2⁺ and limiting the presence of free water in the electrolyte during cycling. Theoretical calculation and experimental results demonstrate that the POPSO‐Na additive can not only replace the structural water around Zn2+ to destroy the original solvation sheath, but also form reverse micelle interface structure to hinder the proton transition and constrain the free water in the electrolyte. Thus, the Zn||Zn battery utilizing the ZnSO4+POPSO‐Na electrolyte exhibits an impressive cycle life of 1600 h at a current density of 1 mA cm−2, achieving an average Coulomb efficiency (CE) of ≈100%, which is significantly better than that observed with the ZnSO4 electrolyte. Moreover, the Zn||Cu battery with ZnSO4+POPSO‐Na electrolyte achieves high stability even after cycling for over 2000 h.",

However, a lack of suitable anode materials has become a key obstacle for the development of SIBs. Here we explore the potential of the two-dimensional (2D) Y-C space and identify a novel anode material for SIBs, a new Y4C3 sheet with P3̄m1 crystal symmetry, by means of first-principles swarm structure calculations. This Y4C3P3̄m1 structure has rather good kinetic and thermodynamic stability, possesses intrinsic metallicity, and remains metallic after adsorbing Na atoms, ensuring good electrical conductivity during the SIB cycle. Remarkably, a Y4C3 sheet as an anode for SIBs possesses the essential properties of a high specific capacity (∼752 mA h g-1), a low barrier energy (∼0.1 eV), and suitable open-circuit voltage (0-0.15 V). These characteristics are comparable and even superior to those of another known 2D Y2C anode material, indicating that the Y4C3 sheet can act as an appealing new candidate as an anode material for SIBs and offering new insights into the 2D Y-C space.",

        "abstract": "MoS2 , as a classical 2D material, becomes a capable anode candidate for sodium-ion batteries. However, MoS2 presents a disparate electrochemical performance in the ether-based and ester-based electrolyte with unclear mechanism. Herein, tiny MoS2 nanosheets embedded in nitrogen/sulfur-codoped carbon (MoS2 @NSC) networks are designed and fabricated through an uncomplicated solvothermal method. Thanks to the ether-based electrolyte, the MoS2 @NSC shows a unique capacity growth in the original stage of cycling. But in the ester-based electrolyte, MoS2 @NSC shows a usual capacity decay. The increasing capacity puts down to the gradual transformation from MoS2 to MoS3 with the structure reconstruction. Based on the above mechanism, MoS2 @NSC demonstrates an excellent recyclability and the specific capacity keeps around 286 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 after 5000 cycles with an ultralow capacity fading rate of only 0.0034% per cycle. In addition, a MoS2 @NSC‖Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 full cell with ether-based electrolyte is assembled and demonstrates a capacity of 71 mAh g-1 , suggesting the potential application of MoS2 @NSC. Here the electrochemical conversion mechanism of MoS2 is revealed in the ether-based electrolyte and significance of the electrolyte design on the promoting Na ion storage behavior is highlighted.",

        "abstract": "Binders play a crucial role in the development of silicon (Si) anodes for lithium-ion batteries with high specific energy. The large volume change of Si (∼300%) during repeated discharge and charge processes causes the destruction and separation of electrode materials from the copper (Cu) current collector and ultimately results in poor cycling performance. In the present study, we design and prepare hydrogen-bonding cross-linked thiourea-based polymeric binders (denoted CMC-co-SN) in consideration of their excellent binding interaction with the Cu current collector and low cost as well. The CMC-co-SN binders are formed through in situ thermopolymerization of chain-type carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC) with thiourea (SN) in the drying process of Si electrode disks. A tight and physical interlocked layer between the CMC-co-SN binder and Cu current collector is derived from a dendritic nonstoichiometric copper sulfide (CuxS) layer on the interface and enhances the binding of electrode materials with the Cu current collector. When applying the CMC-co-SN binders to micro- (∼3 μm) (μSi) and nano- (∼50 nm) (nSi) Si particles, the Si anodes exhibit high initial Coulomb efficiency (91.5% for μSi and 83.2% for nSi) and excellent cyclability (1121 mA h g-1 for μSi after 140 cycles and 1083 mA h g-1 for nSi after 300 cycles). The results demonstrate that the CMC-co-SN binders together with a physical interlocked layer have significantly improved the electrochemical performance of Si anodes through strong binding forces with the current collector to maintain electrode integrity and avoid electric contact loss.",

        "abstract": "Manganese-based chalcogenides would be of latent capacity in serving as anodes for assembling lithium- and/or sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs) due to their large theoretical capacity, low price, and low-toxicity functionality, while the low electroconductivity and easy agglomeration behavior may impede their technical applications. Here, a solid-state solution of MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes in rock-salt phase has been synthesized for the first time at a relatively low temperature from the precursors of Mn(II) acetylacetonate with dibenzyl dichalcogens in oleylamine with octadecene, and the MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes have been assembled with N-doped graphene to form a new kind of heterostructured nanohybrids (shortened as MnS0.5Se0.5/N-G hybrids), which are very potential for the fabrication of metal-ion batteries including LIBs and/or SIBs. Investigations revealed that there have been dense vacancies generated and active sites increased via nonequilibrium alloying of MnS and MnSe into the solid-solution MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes with segregation and defects achieved in the low-temperature solution synthetic route. Meanwhile, the introduction of N-doped graphene forming heterojunction interfaces between MnS0.5Se0.5 and N-doped graphene would efficiently enhance their electroconductivity and avoid agglomeration of the active MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes with considerably improved electrochemical properties. As a result, the MnS0.5Se0.5/N-G hybrids delivered superior Li/Na storage capacities with outstanding rate performance as well as satisfactorily lasting stability (1039/457 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 for LIBs/SIBs). Additionally, full-cell LIBs of the anodic MnS0.5Se0.5/N-G constructed with cathodic LiFePO4 (LFP) further confirmed the promising future for their practical application.",

Molten salt etching is not only short in time but also safe and simple, laying a good foundation for industrialization. Here, we compare the traditional F‐containing etching method with the molten salt etching method. Transmission electron microscopy elemental mapping images and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy show that the Ti3C2Tx surface end of traditional etching is terminated by –F, while the Ti3C2Tx surface end of molten salt etching is terminated by –Cl. Finally, the sodium‐ion batteries are fabricated and the performance difference of the three etching methods is compared. The results show that the capacity of 102.1 mAh g–1 can still be reached when the molten salt etching MXene material returns to 0.1 A g–1 after the current density of 5 A g–1. After 500 cycles at 1 A g–1, there is no significant loss of capacity and the Coulomb efficiency is close to 100%.

        "abstract": "The poor reversibility of the zinc (Zn) anodes and the irreversible deposition/dissolution of Mn2+/MnO2 significantly impede the commercialization of Zn–Mn aqueous batteries (ZMABs). In reducing the difference between the desired interfacial reaction environments of the cathode and anode, we found that they face the same problem of interference-the generation of irreversible corrosion products. Herein, we have introduced a novel self-regulatory mechanism. This mechanism involves the addition of sodium dihydrogen phosphate, which shifts from passive protection to active regulation. It effectively captures OH− ions, prevents corrosion product formation, and facilitates the in situ generation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film. This modification also homogenizes Zn ion flow and improves the reversibility of Zn plating and stripping. Furthermore, a stable and slightly acidic environment has been established to stabilize the pH at the cathodic interface, mitigate corrosion product formation, and enhance the reversible deposition and dissolution of Mn2+/MnO2. With the optimal electrolyte, Zn‖Zn symmetric cells demonstrate stable operation for over 3000 hours at 1 mA cm−2, 1 mA h cm−2. Additionally, the Zn‖Cu cells maintain high reversibility after 1000 cycles, achieving an average coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.76%. The assembled Zn‖MnO2 full cells exhibit exceptional cycling stability and rate performance. This work adopts the approach of seeking common ground and emphasizing the balance of cathode and anode interfacial requirements, which represents a new and significant insight for design of ZMABs with high reversibility and high cyclability.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) have attracted much attention due to integrating the high energy density of battery and high out power of supercapacitors. However, rapid Na+ diffusion kinetics in cathode is counterbalanced with sluggish anode, hindering the further advancement and commercialization of SIHCs. Here, aiming at conversion-type metal sulfide anode, taking typical VS2 as an example, a comprehensive regulation of nanostructure and electronic properties through NH4 + pre-intercalation and Mo-doping VS2 (Mo-NVS2 ) is reported. It is demonstrated that NH4 + pre-intercalation can enlarge the interplanar spacing and Mo-doping can induce interlayer defects and sulfur vacancies that are favorable to construct new ion transport channels, thus resulting in significantly enhanced Na+ diffusion kinetics and pseudocapacitance. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that the introduction of NH4 + and Mo-doping enhances the electronic conductivity, lowers the diffusion energy barrier of Na+ , and produces stronger d-p hybridization to promote conversion kinetics of Na+ intercalation intermediates. Consequently, Mo-NVS2 delivers a record-high reversible capacity of 453 mAh g-1 at 3 A g-1 and an ultra-stable cycle life of over 20 000 cycles. The assembled SIHCs achieve impressive energy density/power density of 98 Wh kg-1 /11.84 kW kg-1 , ultralong cycling life of over 15000 cycles, and very low self-discharge rate (0.84 mV h-1 ).",

On charge, the supercapacitor removes salt in a flowing saltwater electrolyte through Cl- electrochemical adsorption at the cathode and Na+ intercalation at the anode. Discharge delivers useful electric energy and regenerates the electrodes.

        "abstract": "Metal phosphides exhibit high energy densities as hosts for lithium/sodium storage owing to their conversion reaction mechanism. Nevertheless, they typically suffer from inferior reversibility and cyclability because of the dissolution of polyphosphides and sluggish electrochemical kinetics. Herein, a series of dual‐bond confined MXene‐MxPy‐G composites have been fabricated, in which MxPy nanoparticles are strongly bound with MXene and graphene nanosheets via Ti─P and C‐P bonds. On one hand, the dual‐bond confinement offers strong adsorption to trap polyphosphides, greatly stabilizing the conversion‐formed products during cycling. On the other hand, dual‐bond immobilization largely promotes electron transfer and ion diffusion, facilitating the reversibility of conversion reactions. As anticipated, these MXene‐MxPy‐G hybrids demonstrate superb lithium/sodium‐storage performance. Particularly, as an anode for lithium‐ion batteries, the MXene‐Sn4P3‐G delivers a high initial coulombic efficiency of 90.1% and a high reversible capacity of 1058.6 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1. Even tested at high rates of 1.0/2.0 A g−1, it can still maintain high reversible capacities of 820.6/726.5 mAh g−1 after 1450 cycles. When applied in pouch full‐cells and sodium‐ion batteries, it also shows extended cyclic lifespans of 350 and 1200 cycles.

Herein, a novel energy storage material based on cobalt metaphosphate nanosheet arrays self-supported on carbon cloths [Co(PO3)2 NSs/CC] is fabricated by a two-step strategy. This rationally designed strategy avoids the preparation of the complex {Co[O2P(OtBu)2]2}n precursor, which significantly simplifies the synthesis process. The active CC acts not only as an electrically conductive substrate as usual but also as a functional basis to suppress PH3-involved reaction and to promote HPO3-involved reaction during the phosphating process, contributing to the formation of Co(PO3)2. The mutual cross-linked porous Co(PO3)2 nanosheets vertically grow on the surface of activated CC, ensuring sufficient electrolyte infiltration and fast electron transport among the electrodes. Sodium ion storage analysis for the Co(PO3)2 NSs/CC electrode reveals a multi-step reaction mechanism with high reversibility, as reflected by the high reversible capacity (667 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1) and excellent cyclability (with almost no capacity decay over 500 cycles). This novel electrode is also well capable of storing potassium ions, exhibiting high reversible capacity, which outperforms most reported anodes for potassium-ion batteries.

The porous structure offers easy access of the liquid electrolyte and a short transport path of Na+ through the pores toward the TiO2 nanoparticle. Furthermore, the high density of grain boundaries between the anatase TiO2 and rutile TiO2 offer more interfaces for a novel interfacial storage. The a-TiO2-x /r-TiO2-x shows excellent long cycling stability (134 mAh g-1 at 10 C after 4500 cycles) and superior rate performance (93 mAh g-1 after 4500 cycles at 20 C) for sodium-ion batteries. This simple and effective process could serve as a model for the modification of other materials applied in energy storage systems and other fields.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (NaIBs) are increasingly being envisioned for grid-scale energy storage systems because of cost advantages. However, implementation of this vision has been challenged by the low energy densities delivered by most NaIB cathodes. Toward addressing this challenge, the authors report the synthesis and characterization of a new iron-doped Na3Fe0.3V1.7O(PO4)2F2 cathode using a novel facile hydrothermal route. The synthesized material was characterized using x ray diffraction, Mössbauer spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy techniques. Obtained discharge capacity in half-cell configuration lies from 119 to 125 to 130 mAh/g at C/10 while tested using three different electrolyte formulations, DMC-EC-PC, DEC-EC, and EC-PC, respectively. The synthesized cathodes were also evaluated in full-cell configurations, which delivered an initial discharge capacity of 80 mAh/g with NaTi2(PO4)3MWCNT as the anode. Ionic diffusivity and interfacial charge transfer kinetics were also evaluated as a function of temperature and sodium concentration, which revealed that electrochemical rate performances in this material were limited by charge transfer kinetics. To understand the heat generation mechanism of the Na/Na3Fe0.3V1.7O(PO4)2F2 half-cell during charge and discharge processes, an electrochemical isothermal calorimetry measurement was carried out at different current rates for two different temperatures (25 and 45°C). The results showed that the amount of heat generated was strongly affected by the operating charge/discharge state, C-rate, and temperature. Overall, this work provides a new synthesis route for the development of iron-doped Na3Fe0.3V1.7O(PO4)2F2-based high-performance sodium cathode material aimed at providing a viable pathway for the development and deployment of large-scale energy storage based on sodium battery systems.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) has been widely adopted as the anode material for sodium ion batteries (NIBs). However, it is troubled by a low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) due to its porous structure. Herein, a graphitized and ultrathin carbon layer coating on HC is proposed to solve this challenge. The as-prepared porous carbon material coated with an ultrathin carbon layer composite (PCS@V@C) exhibits a cavity structure, which is prepared by using bis(cyclopentadienyl) nickel (CP-Ni) as the carbon source for outer coating, glucose carbon spheres as porous carbon, and introducing a silica layer to facilitate the coating process. When utilized as the anode for NIBs, the material shows an ICE increase from 47.1% to 85.3%, and specific capacity enhancement at 0.1 A g-1 from 155.3 to 216.7 mA h g-1. Moreover, its rate capability and cycling performance are outstanding, demonstrating a capacity of 140.3 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1, and a retaining capacity of 225.6 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 with the Coulombic efficiency of 100% at the second cycle. The excellent electrochemical performance of the PCS@V@C is attributed to the ultrathin carbon layer, which is beneficial for the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film. Therefore, this study provides a feasible surface modification method for the preparation of anode materials for NIBs with high specific capacity and ICE.",

Still, major drawbacks for the commercial application of SIBs lie in the slow kinetic processes and poor cycling performance of the devices. In this work, a hybrid nanocomposite of Sb2O3 nanoparticles anchored on N-doped graphene nanoribbons (GNR) is implemented as anode material in SIBs. The obtained Sb2O3/N-GNR anode delivers a reversible specific capacity of 642 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 and exhibits a good rate capability. Even after 500 cycles at 5 A g−1, the specific capacity is maintained at about 405 mA h g−1. Such good Na storage performance is mainly ascribed to the beneficial effect of N doping for charge transfer and to the improved microstructure that facilitates the Na+ diffusion through the overall electrode.",

        "abstract": "Anode-free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) are regarded as the \"ceiling\" for current sodium-based batteries. However, their practical application is hindered by the unstable electrolyte and interfacial chemistry at the high-voltage cathode and anode-free side, especially under extreme temperature conditions. Here, an advanced electrolyte design strategy based on electrolyte solvation engineering is presented, which shapes a weakly solvating anion-stabilized (WSAS) electrolyte by balancing the interaction between the Na+-solvent and Na+-anion. The special interaction constructs rich contact ion pairs (CIPs) /aggregates (AGGs) clusters at the electrode/electrolyte interface during the dynamic solvation process which facilitates the formation of a uniform and stable interfacial layer, enabling highly stable cycling of 4.0 V-class layered oxide cathode from -40 °C to 60 °C and excellent reversibility of Na plating/stripping with an ultrahigh average CE of 99.89%. Ultimately, industrial multi-layer anode-free pouch cells using the WSAS electrolyte achieve 80% capacity remaining after 50 cycles and even deliver 74.3% capacity at -30 °C.

The metallic feature of the BGe monolayer can be maintained after absorbing different numbers of Na atoms, ensuring good electronic conductivity during the charge/discharge process. The calculated migration energy barrier, open-circuit voltage, and theoretical specific capacity of the BGe monolayer are much better than those of some other two-dimensional (2D) materials.

        "abstract": "Nowadays, great attention is being directed towards the development of promising electrode materials for non-lithium rechargeable batteries such as sodium and calcium ion batteries (SIBs and CIBs), due to their large abundance, storage capacity and charge/discharge rate. Using density functional theory (DFT) based computations we have predicted that the recently synthesized bilayer s-tetrazine based covalent organic framework (bilayer TZACOF) may be a promising anode material for sodium and calcium ion batteries. The electronic band structure calculations suggest that the bilayer TZACOF is an indirect band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 0.95 eV. The sodium and calcium atoms are adsorbed on the bilayer TZACOF at the most energetically favorable adsorption sites with adsorption energies of -1.37 eV and -2.27 eV, respectively. Moreover, the diffusion energy barriers for the migration of sodium and calcium atoms on the bilayer TZACOF are 0.19 eV and 0.63 eV, respectively, which indicates the fast ion mobility and charge/discharge rate. The theoretical specific capacity (TSC) of the bilayer TZACOF as the electrode material for SIBs and CIBs is 618.69 and 412.46 mA h g-1, respectively. Furthermore, the average voltage of the bilayer TZACOF as the electrode material for SIBs and CIBs is found to be 0.96 and 1.13 V, respectively. Based on the results of rich electronic properties, low diffusion barriers, high storage capacity, and low average voltage, we can reach at the conclusion that the bilayer TZACOF may be a suitable candidate for use as an anode material for sodium and calcium ion batteries (SIBs and CIBs).",

Heterostructure construction is an effective strategy for boosting Na+ storage of SnSe2. Herein, an appealing yolk‐shell nanostructure of SnSe2/NiSe2 heterointerface with rich Se vacancies embedded into N‐doped carbon (SnSe2/NiSe2@NC) is precisely designed through a facile hydrothermal process followed by a selenization strategy.

The yolk‐shell nanostructure and N‐doped carbon buffer the volume variation and improve the structural stability of the electrode material during sodium storage processes.

        "abstract": "In recent years, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted a lot of attention and are considered an ideal alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The hard carbon (HC) anode in SIBs presents a unique challenge for studying the formation process of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during initial cycling, owing to its distinctive porous structure. This study employs a combination of ultrasonic scanning techniques and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry to conduct an in-depth analysis of the two-dimensional distribution and composition of gases during the formation process. The findings reveal distinct gas evolution behaviors in SIBs compared to LIBs during formation. Notably, significant gas evolution is observed during the discharge phase of the formation cycle in SIBs, with higher discharge rates leading to increased gas evolution rates. This phenomenon is likely attributed to the adsorption of CO2 gas by the abundant pores in HC, followed by desorption during discharge. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the addition of 5A molecular sieves, which competitively adsorb gases, effectively reduces gas adsorption on the anode during formation, thereby significantly enhancing battery performance. This research elucidates the gas adsorption and desorption behavior at the battery interface, providing new insights into the SEI formation process in SIBs.",

Two of the most promising new classes of electrolytes are evaluated herein with a sodium layered-oxide cathode, for the first time: a localized high-concentration electrolyte (LHCE) composed of sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide, dimethyl ether, and tetrafluoropropyl ether and a \"highly fluorinated\" electrolyte (HFE) composed of 20% fluoroethylene carbonate with a lithium difluorophosphate additive. With a combination of electrochemical and post-mortem characterization techniques, the stability of each electrolyte is assessed with the O3-type Na(Ni0.3Fe0.4Mn0.3)O2 cathode and sodium metal anode. Both electrolytes significantly improve the surface and bulk stability of the cathode, but only the LHCE has a meaningful improvement on sodium metal stability. For the purpose of developing a long-lasting, sodium-ion full cell, both classes of electrolyte show great promise.",

        "abstract": "Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has attracted extensive research interest as a fascinating anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of its high specific capacity of 670 mA h g-1. However, unsatisfied cycling durability and poor rate performance are two barriers that hinder MoS2 for practical application in SIBs. Herein, 3D interconnected MoS2 with enlarged interlayer spacing epitaxially grown on 1D electrospinning carbon nanofibers (denoted as MoS2@CNFs) was prepared as a flexible anode for SIBs via l-cysteine-assisted hydrothermal method. Benefitting from the C-O-Mo bonding between the CNFs and MoS2 as well as the rational design with novel structure, including the well-retained 3D interconnected and conductive MoS2@CNFs networks and expanded (002) plane interlayer space, the flexible MoS2@CNFs electrode achieves a remarkable specific capacity (528 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1), superior rate performance (412 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1), and ultralong cycle life (over 600 cycles at 1 A g-1 with excellent Coulombic efficiencies exceeding 99%).

        "abstract": "In recent times, few-layer black phosphorus (BP) has attracted tremendous attention as a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries due to its particular two-dimensional structure, good electron conductivity, and high theoretical capacity. The main disadvantages of BP-based materials are the lower practical specific capacity of the BP-based composite than expectation because of the low P atom utilization and the structural fracture due to the large volume expansion that occurs during sodiation/desodiation cycles. In this work, we report a ternary composite comprising BP, graphite, and polyaniline (BP-G/PANI) with a BP mass content of ∼65 wt %. The ternary composite provides an optimized ion pathway (electrolyte → PANI → BP-G → BP), which reduces the charge transfer resistance of the electrode. Also, further ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that the presence of graphite in the BP-G composite allows a deep sodiation of BP and also leads to a higher sodiation/desodiation reversibility. In addition, the uniformly coated PANI also restricts the huge volume expansion of the BP electrode through discharge/charge processes, which promise the stable cycling performance of BP-G/PANI. Thus, our composite shows a high reversible gravimetric capacity of 1530 mAh gcompo.-1 at 0.25 A g-1 and a capacity retention of 520 mAh gcompo.-1 after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 4 A g-1.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal phosphides have emerged as a class of promising anode materials of sodium‐ion batteries owing to their excellent sodium storage capacity. However, the limited electronic conductivity and significant volume expansion have impeded their further advancement. In this work, we propose a rational design of cube‐like CoP @C composites with unique core‐shell structure via in situ phosphating and subsequent carbon coating processes. The uniform carbon coating serves as a physical buffering layer that effectively mitigates volume changes during charge/discharge processes, and prevents particle agglomeration and fragmentation, thereby enhancing the structural stability of electrode. Moreover, the nitrogen‐rich carbon layer not only provides additional active sites for sodium ion adsorption but also improves the electrode conductivity and accelerates charge transport dynamics. Consequently, the as‐synthesized CoP@C exhibits a remarkable capacity retention rate of 94.8% after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g‐1 and achieves a high reversible capacity of 146.7 mAh g‐1 even under a high current density of 4.0 A g‐1.",

        "abstract": "Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a commonly used coating technique for lithium ion battery electrodes. Recently, it has been applied to sodium ion battery anode materials. ALD is known to improve the cycling performance, Coulombic efficiency of batteries, and maintain electrode integrity. Here, the electrochemical performance of uncoated P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 electrodes is compared to that of ALD-coated Al2O3 P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 electrodes. Given that ALD coatings are in the early stage of development for NIB cathode materials, little is known about how ALD coatings, in particular aluminum oxide (Al2O3), affect the electrode-electrolyte interface. Therefore, full characterizations of its effects are presented in this work. For the first time, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to elucidate the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on ALD-coated electrodes. It contains less carbonate species and more inorganic species, which allows for fast Na kinetics, resulting in significant increase in Coulombic efficiency and decrease in cathode impedance. The effectiveness of Al2O3 ALD coating is also surprisingly reflected in the enhanced mechanical stability of the particle which prevents particle exfoliation.",

        "abstract": "The rational design of porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high conductivity and reversible redox activity is the key to improving their performance in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we report a series of COFs (FPDC-TPA-COF, FPDC-TPB-COF, and FPDC-TPT-COF) based on an organosulfur linker, (trioxocyclohexane-triylidene)tris(dithiole-diylylidene))hexabenzaldehyde (FPDC). These COFs feature two-dimensional crystalline structures, high porosity, good conductivity, and densely packed redox-active sites, making them suitable for energy storage devices. Among them, FPDC-TPT-COF demonstrates a remarkably high specific capacity of 420 mAh g-1 (0.2 A g-1), excellent cycling stability (~87% capacity retention after 3000 cycles, 1.0 A g-1) and high rate performance (339 mAh g-1 at 2.0 A g-1) as an anode for SIBs, surpassing most reported COF-based electrodes. The superior performance is attributed to the dithiole moieties enhancing the conductivity and the presence of redox-active carbonyl, imine, and triazine sites facilitating Na storage. Furthermore, the sodiation mechanism was elucidated through in-situ experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work highlights the advantages of integrating multiple functional groups into redox-active COFs for the rational design of efficient and stable SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The Fe‐based anode of sodium‐ion batteries attracts much attention due to the abundant source, low‐cost, and high specific capacity. However, the low electron and ion transfer rate, poor structural stability, and shuttle effect of NaS2 intermediate restrain its further development. Herein, the Fe3O4/Fe/FeS tri‐heterojunction node spawned N‐carbon nanotube scaffold structure (FHNCS) was designed using the modified MIL‐88B(Fe) as a template followed by catalytic growth and sulfidation process. During catalytic growth process, the reduced Fe monomers catalyze the growth of N‐doped carbon nanotubes to connect the Fe3O4/Fe/FeS tri‐heterojunction node, forming a 3D scaffold structure. Wherein the N‐doped carbon promotes the transfer of electrons between Fe3O4/Fe/FeS particles, and the tri‐heterojunction facilitates the diffusion of electrons at the interface, to organize a 3D conductive network. The unique scaffold structure provides more active sites and shortens the Na+ diffusion path. Meanwhile, the structure exhibits excellent mechanical stability to alleviate the volume expansion during circulation. Furthermore, the Fe in Fe3O4/Fe heterojunction can adjust the d‐band center of Fe in Fe3O4 to enhance the adsorption between Fe3O4 and Na2S intermediate, which restrains the shuttle effect. Therefore, the FHNCS demonstrates a high specific capacity of 436 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, 84.7% and 73.4% of the initial capacities are maintained after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 and 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1.

An optimal performance was obtained after heat treatment at 400°C, related to the very good adhesion of the electrode’s active mass to the current collector, and the ability of the heat‐treated binder to enhance the active mass integrity upon cycling.\nA comparison between optimized anodes developed herein to other Si anodes containing frequently used binders like Sodium Alginate (SA) and Lithium Polyacrylate (LiPAA), demonstrated clear advantages of the heat‐treated Si anodes containing P84.",

Liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that the IL remains essentially stable during the reaction. It was recovered almost quantitatively by distilling off the organic solvent used for product separation. Composites of SnSb powder and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were fabricated by a simple ball milling process. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the Na‖SnSb/CNTs cell retains close to 100% of its initial capacity after 50 cycles at a current of 50 mA g−1, which is much better than the Na‖SnSb cell. The greatly increased capacity retainability can be attributed to the conductive network formed by CNTs inside the SnSb/CNTs electrode, providing 3D effective and fast electronic pathways during sodium intercalation and de-intercalation.",

For instance, it delivers high reversible capacities (491 mA h g-1 after 50 cycles at 0.1 A g-1), high rate performance (387 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1) and long-term cycling stability (234 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 3000 cycles). Note that it shows one of the best long-term cycling properties reported to date for MoS2-based anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. This regulation strategy may offer new insights into the fabrication of high-performance anode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) is emerging as a popular cathode for sodium-ion batteries owing to its stable structure, high operating voltage, and large energy density. However, its practical application is hindered by its low conductivity. In addition, due to the loss of fluorine during synthesis, Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) impurity is often easily generated, resulting in a decrease in actual operating voltage. Herein, a bifunctional carbon network composed of an N-doped carbon layer and carbon bridge is constructed around NVPF particles. Through pyrolysis of polydopamine (PDA), the NVPF particles are covered in situ by an N-doped carbon layer, and the carbon bridge generated by polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is also coated with N-doped carbon. Besides, PTFE also serves as a fluorine supplement to ensure that pure NVPF is obtained. As a result, the bifunctional N-doped carbon network-modified NVPF delivers a high reversible capacity (125.7 mA h g-1 at 0.2 C) and appreciable cycle stability (92.7% at 1 C over 300 cycles, and 89.8% at 10 C over 1500 cycles). When assembled into a full cell with a commercial hard carbon anode, it displays a discharge median voltage of up to 3.62 V at 0.2 C. Furthermore, it achieves a high energy density of 373.7 W h kg-1 at a power density of 461.2 W kg-1, with an excellent specific energy retention of 78.2% after 200 cycles. Therefore, this modification method is expected to be extended to other fluorine-containing materials with poor electrical conductivity.",

When used as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries, the NDCFs deliver a high reversible capacity of 86.2 mAh g-1 even after 2000 cycles at a high current density of 10.0 A g-1. It is proposed that the excellent Na+ storage performance is mainly due to the defective surface of the NDCFs created by the high content of N dopant.

However, the relative large volume changes during the sodiation/desodiation process usually result in a fast capacity decay, poor cycling stability, and sluggish electrode kinetics which hinder their practical applications. Herein, NiS1.03 porous hollow spheres (NiS1.03 PHSs) and porous NiS1.03 hollow cages (NiS1.03 PHCs) with high yield are designed and selectively fabricated via a simple solvothermal and subsequent annealing approach.

        "abstract": "Sodium titanate Na2Ti3O7 (NTO) has superior electrochemical properties as an anode material in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), and Nb or V doping is suggested to enhance the electrode performance. In this work, we carry out systematic first-principles calculations of the structural, electronic and electrochemical properties of NTO and Na2Ti2.75M0.25O7 (M = Nb, V), using supercells to reveal the effect of Nb or V NTO-doping on its anode performance. It is found that Nb doping gives rise to the expansion of cell volume but V doping induces the shrinkage of cell volume due to the larger and smaller ionic radius of the Nb and V ions, respectively, compared to that of the Ti ion. We perform structural optimization of the intermediate phases of Na2+xM3O7 with increasing Na content x from 0 to 2, revealing that the overall relative volume expansion rate is slightly increased by Nb and V doping but remains lower than 3%. Our calculations demonstrate that the electrode potential of NTO is slightly raised and the specific capacity is reduced, but the electronic and ionic conductivities are improved by Nb or V doping. With the revealed understanding and mechanisms, our work will contribute to the search for advanced electrode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have gradually become one of the most promising energy storage techniques in the current era of post-lithium-ion batteries. For anodes, transitional metal selenides (TMSe) based materials are welcomed choices , owing to relatively higher specific capacities and enriched redox active sites. Nevertheless, current bottlenecks are blamed for their poor intrinsic electronic conductivities, and uncontrollable volume expansion during redox reactions. Given that, an interfacial-confined isochronous conversion strategy is proposed, to prepare orthorhombic/cubic biphasic TMSe heterostructure, namely CuSe/Cu3 VSe4 , through using MXene as the precursor, followed by Cu/Se dual anchorage. As-designed biphasic TMSe heterostructure endows unique hierarchical structure, which contains adequate insertion sites and diffusion spacing for Na ions, besides, the surficial pseudocapacitive storage behaviors can be also proceeded like 2D MXene. By further investigation on electronic structure, the theoretical calculations indicate that biphasic CuSe/Cu3 VSe4 anode exhibits well-enhanced properties, with smaller bandgap and thus greatly improves intrinsic poor conductivities. In addition, the dual redox centers can enhance the electrochemical Na ions storage abilities. As a result, the as-designed biphasic TMSe anode can deliver a reversible specific capacity of 576.8 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 , favorable Na affinity, and reduced diffusion barriers. This work discloses a synchronous solution toward demerits in conductivities and lifespan, which is inspiring for TMSe-based anode development in SIBs systems.",

The fluorinated carboxylate anode, disodium 2, 5-difluoroterephthalate (DFTP-Na), outperforms the other carboxylate anodes with H, Cl, and Br, in terms of high specific capacity (212 mA h g-1), long cycle life (300 cycles), and high rate capability (up to 5 A g-1). As evidenced by the experimental and computational results, the two F atoms in DFTP reduce the solubility, enhance the cyclic stability, and interact with Na+ during the redox reaction, resulting in a high-capacity and stable organic anode material in NIBs. Therefore, this work proves that fluorinating carboxylate compounds is an effective approach to developing high-performance organic anodes for stable and sustainable NIBs.",

        "abstract": "While cost‐effective sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) with crystalline silicon anodes promise high theoretical capacities, they perform poorly because silicon stores sodium ineffectively (capacity <40 mAh g−1). To address this issue, herein an atomic‐order structural‐design tactic is adopted for obtaining unique multilevel gradient‐ordered silicon (MGO‐Si) by simple electrochemical reconstruction. In situ‐formed short‐range‐, medium‐range‐, and long‐range‐ordered structures construct a stable MGO‐Si, which contributes to favorable Na–Si interaction and fast ion diffusion channels. These characteristics afford a high reversible capacity (352.7 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1) and stable cycling performance (95.2% capacity retention after 4000 cycles), exhibiting record values among those reported for pure silicon electrodes. Sodium storage of MGO‐Si involves an adsorption–intercalation mechanism, and a stepwise construction strategy of gradient‐ordered structure further improves the specific capacity (339.5 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1). Reconstructed Si/C composites show a high reversible capacity of 449.5 mAh g−1, significantly better than most carbonaceous anodes. The universality of this design principle is demonstrated for other inert or low‐capacity materials (micro‐Si, SiO2, SiC, graphite, and TiO2), boosting their capacities by 1.5–6 times that of pristine materials, thereby providing new solutions to facilitate sodium storage capability for better‐performing battery designs.",

        "title": "Synergetic Strategy for the Fabrication of Self-Standing Distorted Carbon Nanofibers with Heteroatom Doping for Sodium-Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "Currently, the limited availability of lithium sources is escalating the cost of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Considering the fluctuating economics of LIBs, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have now drawn attention because sodium is an earth-abundant, low-cost element that exhibits similar chemistry to that of LIBs. Despite developments in different anode materials, there still remain several challenges in SIBs, including lighter cell design for SIBs. The presented work designs a facile strategy to prepare nitrogen-doped free-standing pseudo-graphitic nanofibers via electrospinning. A structural and morphological study implies highly disordered graphitic structured nanofibers having diameters of ∼120–170 nm, with a smooth surface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed that nitrogen was successfully doped in carbon nanofibers (CNFs). When served as an anode material for SIBs, the resultant material exhibits excellent sodium-ion storage properties in terms of long-term cycling stability and high rate capability. Notably, a binder-free self-standing CNF without a current collector was used as an anode for SIBs that delivered capacities of 210 and 87 mA h g–1 at 20 and 1600 mA g–1, respectively, retaining a capacity of 177 mA h g–1 when retained at 20 mA g–1. The as-synthesized CNFs demonstrate a long cycle life with a relatively high Columbic efficiency of 98.6% for the 900th cycle, with a stable and excellent rate capacity. The sodium storage mechanisms of the CNFs were examined with various nitrogen concentrations and carbonization temperatures. Furthermore, the diffusion coefficients of the sodium ions based on the electrochemical impedance spectra measurement have been calculated in the range of 10–15–10–12 cm2 s–1, revealing excellent diffusion mobility for Na atoms in the CNFs. This study demonstrates that optimum nitrogen doping and carbonization temperature demonstrated a lower Warburg coefficient and a higher Na-ion diffusion coefficient leads to enhanced stable electrochemical performance. Thus, our study shows that the nitrogen-doped CNFs will have potential for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Electrochemical performance of the layered compound CrPS4 for the usage as anode material in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) was examined and exceptional reversible long-term capacity and capacity retention were found. After 300 cycles, an extraordinary reversible capacity of 687 mAh g-1 at a current rate of 1 A g-1 was achieved, while rate capability tests showed an excellent capacity retention of 100%. Detailed evaluation of the data evidence a change of the electrochemical reaction upon cycling leading to the striking long-term performance. Further investigations targeted the reaction mechanism of the first cycle by applying complementary techniques, i.e., powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), pair distribution function (PDF) analysis, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and 23Na/31P magic-angle-spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The results indicated an unexpectedly complex reaction pathway including formation of several intercalation compounds, depending on the amount of Na inserted at the early discharge states and subsequent conversion to Na2S and strongly disordered metallic Cr at the completely discharged state. While XAS measurements suggest no further presence of intermediates after formation of Na intercalation compounds, several different phases are detected via MAS NMR upon continued discharging. Especially the data obtained from the MAS NMR investigations therefore point toward a very complex reaction pathway. Furthermore, solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation, resulting in the presence of NaF, was observed. After recharging the anode material, no structural long-range order occurred, but short-range order indeed resembled the local environment of the starting material, to a certain extent.",

        "abstract": "MnFe2O4 nanodots (∼3.3 nm) homogeneously dispersed in porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (denoted as MFO@C) were prepared by a feasible electrospinning technique. Meanwhile, MFO@C with the character of flexible free-standing membrane was directly used as binder- and current collector-free anode for sodium-ion batteries, exhibiting high electrochemical performance with high-rate capability (305 mA h g(-1) at 10000 mA g(-1) in comparison of 504 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1)) and ultralong cycling life (ca. 90% capacity retention after 4200 cycles). The Na-storage mechanism was systematically studied, revealing that MnFe2O4 is converted into metallic Mn and Fe after the first discharge (MnFe2O4 + 8Na(+) + 8e(-) → Mn + 2Fe + 4Na2O) and then to MnO and Fe2O3 during the following charge (Mn + 2Fe + 4Na2O → MnO + Fe2O3 + 8Na(+) + 8e(-)). The subsequent cycles occur through reversible redox reactions of MnO + Fe2O3 + 8Na(+) + 8e(-) ↔ Mn + 2Fe + 4Na2O, of which the reduction/oxidation of MnO/Mn takes place at a lower potential than that of Fe2O3/Fe. Furthermore, a soft package sodium-ion full battery with MFO@C anode and Na3V2(PO4)2F3/C cathode was assembled, delivering a stable capacity of ∼400 mA h g(-1) for MFO@C (with 100 cycles at 500 mA g(-1)) and a promising energy density of 77.8 Wh kg(-1) for the whole battery. This is owing to the distinctive structure of very-fine MnFe2O4 nanodots embedded in porous N-doped carbon nanofibers, which effectively improves the utilization rate of active materials, facilitates the transportation of electrons and Na(+) ions, and prevents the particle pulverization/agglomeration upon prolonged cycling.",

        "abstract": "A prime challenge in the development of new battery chemistries is the fundamental understanding of the generation of the electrode–electrolyte interface (EEI) and its evolution upon cycling. Tip‐enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) under an inert gas atmosphere is employed to study the chemical components of the anode/cathode electrolyte interface in a sodium‐ion battery. After the first cycle, TERS reveals that the EEI mostly consists of organic carbonate/dicarbonate, oligoethylene oxides, α,β‐unsaturated vinyl ketones/acetates, and inorganic species ClO4−, ClO3−, and Na2CO3. Whereas after 5× cycling, the EEI composition has evolved to contain long chain monodentate or bridging/bidentate carboxylates and alkoxides. The TERS map reveals the nano‐scale heterogeneity present in the EEI layers and elucidates a multilayered nano‐mosaic coating structure. The sheer volume of Raman signature present in the TERS signal can completely unravel the mysteries regarding the chemical composition and may shed light to the physicochemical behavior of the EEI.",

The electrochemical performances of sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles are studied as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. The galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements have been performed in a voltage range of 0.01-2.6 V vs. Na(+)/Na under different current densities, using the as-prepared sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles as a working electrode. Typically, the initial discharge and charge capacities of sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles are 475 and 380 mA h g(-1), respectively, at a current density of 20 mA g(-1). The sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles exhibit high capacity with a reversible discharge capacity of about 190 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles. It should be emphasized that the discharge reaction consists of two steps which correspond to voltage plateaus of 0.93 V and 0.85 V vs. Na(+)/Na in the first discharge curve of the Na/MoS2 battery, respectively. But there is only one apparent voltage plateau in the Na/Na-Mo-S battery, and it reduces to below 0.5 V vs. Na(+)/Na, which can enhance the power density. All of the findings demonstrate that sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles have steady cycling performance and environmental and cost friendliness as next generation secondary batteries.",

        "abstract": "Developing flexible power sources is crucially important to fulfill the need for wearable electronic devices, but state-of-the-art flexible electrodes cannot meet the requirements of practical applications because of their heavy weight and unsatisfactory mechanical properties. Here, we highlight a design strategy for constructing a novel robust three-dimensional (3D) flexible electrode with a unique sandwichlike N-doped carbon sponge/TiO2-δ/reduced graphene oxide (NCS/TiO2-δ/RGO) configuration. In this electrode architecture, ultrafine defect-rich TiO2-δ nanocrystals are spatially sandwiched by a 3D conformal carbon hybrid matrix, where the 3D porous NCS provides an interconnected open diffusion channel for efficient ionic accessibility while the conformal RGO coating layer serves as an additional upper current collector, resulting in a double continuous conductive network for fast electronic transport and guaranteeing excellent electrochemical reaction kinetics. Hence, the as-built NCS/TiO2-δ/RGO flexible electrodes exhibit high-rate capabilities and long-cycling life in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), and they also exhibit outstanding thermal stability under cycling at 55 °C. More remarkably, a flexible soft-package full battery based on a NCS/TiO2-δ/RGO anode and a LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (for LIBs) or Na0.67Fe0.3Mn0.3Co0.4O2 (for SIBs) cathode shows stable electrochemical characteristics under bending and folding, holding great potential for flexible energy storage devices.",

Herein, the micro/nanostructural Sb/graphene composite (Sb-O-G) is successfully prepared with the uniform Sb nanospheres (∼100 nm) bound on the graphene via oxygen bonds. It is revealed that the in-situ-constructed oxygen bonds play a significant role on enhancing Na-storage properties, especially the ultrafast charge/discharge capability. The oxygen-bond-enhanced Sb-O-G composite can deliver a high capacity of 220 mAh/g at an ultrahigh current density of 12 A/g, which is obviously superior to the similar Sb/G composite (130 mAh/g at 10 A/g) just without Sb-O-C bonds. It also exhibits the highest Na-storage capacity compared to Sb/G and pure Sb nanoparticles as well as the best cycling performance. More importantly, this Sb-O-G anode achieves ultrafast (120 C) energy storage in SIB full cells, which have already been shown to power a 26-bulb array and calculator.

To investigate the electrochemical reaction mechanism of ZnP2-C during sodiation/desodiaiton, various ex-situ analytical techniques were employed. During sodiation, ZnP2 in the composite was transformed into NaZn13 and Na3P phases, exhibiting a one-step conversion reaction. Conversely, Zn and P in the NaZn13 and the Na3P, respectively, were fully recombined to the original ZnP2 phase during desodiation. Owing to the one-step conversion/recombination of ZnP2 in the composite during cycling, ZnP2-C showed high electrochemical performance with a highly reversible capacity of 883 mAh g-1 after 130 cycles with no capacity deterioration and a fast C-rate capability of 500 mAh g-1 at 1C and 350 mAh g-1 at 3C.",

The major obstacle for the practical application of SIBs is the absence of suitable negative electrode materials with long cycling stability and high rate performance. Here, sulfur‐doped double‐shell sodium titanate (Na2Ti3O7) microspheres constructed from 2D ultrathin nanosheets are synthesized via a templating route combined with a low‐temperature sulfurization process. The resulting double‐shell microspheres deliver a high specific capacity (≈222 mAh g−1 at 1 C), excellent cycling stability (162 mAh g−1 after 15 000 cycles at 20 C), and superior rate capability (122 mAh g−1 at 50 C) as anode for SIBs. The improved electrochemical properties originate from synergistic effects between the unique double‐shell nanostructures built from 2D nanosheets architecture and sulfur doping. This synergistic effect not only stabilize Na2Ti3O7‐based electrode during the cycling, but also improve the sluggish Na insertion/extraction kinetics by narrowing the bandgap of Na2Ti3O7. The synthesis strategy proposed here can be developed into a technical rationale for generating high‐performance sodium‐storage devices.",

Herein, novel braided porous carbon fibres (BPCFs) are prepared using the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method. The BPCFs possess interwoven porous structures and abundant vacancies. The growth mechanism of the BPCFs can be attributed to the polycrystalline transformation of the nanoporous copper catalyst in the early stage of CVD process. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the Na+ adsorption energies of the mono‐vacancy edges of the BPCFs (−1.22 and −1.09 eV) are lower than that of an ideal graphene layer (−0.68 eV), clarifying in detail the adsorption‐dominated sodium storage mechanism. Hence, the BPCFs as an anode material present an outstanding discharge capacity of 401 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 500 cycles. Remarkably, this BPCFs anode, under high‐mass‐loading of 5 mg cm−2, shows excellent long‐term cycling ability with a reversible capacity of 201 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1 over 1000 cycles.

Nevertheless, their practical application is plagued by poor diffusion kinetics and dramatic volume fluctuations during the charge-discharge process, resulting in no satisfactory rate and life span so far. Herein, we propose a space-confinement strategy to remarkably promote the cycling stability and rate capacity by embedding FePS3 particles in the interlayer of expanded graphite (EG), which are derived from in situ transformation of graphite intercalation compounds. The layered EG not only greatly alleviates the volume fluctuations of FePS3 by the space confinement effect so as to maintain the stability of the electrode microstructure, but it also ensures rapid Na+ and electron transfer during cycling. When acting as an anode for SIBs, the hybrid electrode delivers a highly reversible capacity of 312.5 mAh g-1 at an ultrahigh rate of 50 A g-1 while retaining an ultralong life span of 1300 cycles with a retention of 82.4% at 10 A g-1.

        "abstract": "Optimisation of the annealing time for the fabrication of nitrogen-doped graphitic-spheres (NDGSs), formed from a nitrogen-functionalised aromatic precursor at 800 °C, to give high nitrogen doping has been performed. Thorough analysis of the NDGSs, approximately 3 μm in diameter, pinpointed an optimum annealing time of 6 to 12 hours to obtain highest nitrogen content at the surface of the spheres (reaching a stoichiometry of around C3N at the surface and C9N in the bulk), with the quantity of sp2 and sp3 surface nitrogen varying with annealing time. The results suggest that changes in the nitrogen dopant level occur through slow diffusion of the nitrogen throughout the NDGSs, along with reabsorption of nitrogen-based gases produced during annealing. A stable bulk nitrogen dopant level of 9% was revealed in the spheres. The NDGSs performed well as anodes in lithium-ion batteries, providing a capacity of up to 265 mA h g−1 at a charging rate of C/20, but did not perform well in sodium-ion batteries without the use of diglyme, consistent with the presence of graphitic regions, but with low internal porosity.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfides are recognized as an excellent alternative to sodium ion anodes ascribed to the outstanding theoretical capacity. The unique crystal arrangement of VS4 gives it exceptional theoretical capacity, despite challenges like insufficient electrical conductivity and undesirable volume expansion. Herein, a novel stabilized anode featuring a distinctive 3D hollow spherical structure is proposed, providing a simple strategy to synthesize such anodes for VS4-HCMSs bonded via C-O-S and V-O-C interfaces. The kinetic investigations and density functional theory reveal that the unique structure connected by interfacial bonds enhances Na+ transport rate and charge transfer efficiency, while carbon greatly mitigates the volume expansion. Unsurprisingly, the VS4-HCMSs exhibit an impressive first-cycle Coulombic efficiency of 91.31% and an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 612 mAh g-1 after 300 cycles at 0.5 A g-1, even exhibit the reversible capacity of 498.8 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 5 A g-1. Additionally, the NaFePO4//VS4-HCMSs full cell is cycled for 200 cycles at 0.2 C and powered the light-emitting diodes for up to 30 minutes afterward. Overall, this work enhances the conductivity and stability of the material by combining VS4 with hollow carbon mesoporous spheres through interfacial bonding, offering an efficient strategy to anode materials in sodium-ion batteries.",

However, most of the previous methods to synthesize SnS2 /graphene composites require long times, high temperatures, or high pressures, which are obstacles for practical low-cost production.

Through this method, ultrafine SnS2 nanoparticles anchored on graphene nanosheets are prepared and exhibit excellent electrochemical performance for both lithium and sodium storage. Specifically, as anodes for lithium-ion batteries, the SnS2 /graphene electrode delivers a high capacity of 1480 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles at 0.2 A g-1 . Even at 10 A g-1 , the SnS2 /graphene electrode can achieve a capacity of 666 mAh g-1 . A constructed full lithium-ion cell exhibits a capacity of 957 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles at 1 A g-1 .

        "abstract": "The volume collapse and slow kinetics reaction of anode materials are two key issues for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, an \"embryo\" strategy is proposed for synthesis of nanorod-embedded MoO2 /MoS2 /C network nanoarchitecture as anode for SIBs with high-rate performance. Interestingly, L-cysteine which plays triple roles including sulfur source, reductant, and carbon source can be utilized to produce the sulfur vacancy-enriched heterostructure. Specifically, L-cysteine can combine with metastable monoclinic MoO3 nanorods at room temperature to encapsulate the \"nutrient\" of MoOx analogues (MoO2.5 (OH)0.5 and MoO3 ·0.5H2 O) and hydrogen-deficient L-cysteine in the \"embryo\" precursor affording for subsequent in situ multistep heating treatment. The resultant MoO2 /MoS2 /C presents a high-rate capability of 875 and 420 mAh g-1 at 0.5 and 10 A g-1 , respectively, which are much better than the MoS2 -based anode materials reported by far. Finite element simulation and analysis results verify that the volume expansion can be reduced to 42.8% from 88.8% when building nanorod-embedded porous network structure. Theoretical calculations reveal that the sulfur vacancies and heterointerface engineering can promote the adsorption and migration of Na+ leading to highly enhanced thermodynamic and kinetic reaction.

        "abstract": "The development of 1D nanostructures with enhanced material properties has been an attractive endeavor for applications in energy and environmental fields, but it remains a major research challenge. Herein, this work demonstrates a simple, gel‐derived method to synthesize uniform 1D elongated sub‐nanotubes with an anatase/bronze TiO2 nanocrystal wall (TiO2 SNTs). The transformation mechanism of TiO2 SNTs is studied by various ex situ characterization techniques. The resulting 1D nanostructures exhibit, synchronously, a high aspect ratio, open tubular interior, and anatase/bronze nanocrystal TiO2 wall. This results in excellent properties of electron/ion transport and reaction kinetics. Consequently, as an anode material for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), the TiO2 SNTs display an ultrastable long‐life cycling stability with a capacity of 107 mAh g−1 at 16 C after 4000 cycles and a high‐rate capacity of 94 mAh g−1 at 32 C. This a high‐rate and long‐life performance is superior to any report on pure TiO2 for SIBs.

        "title": "Borophosphene as a promising Dirac anode with large capacity and high-rate capability for sodium-ion batteries.",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted tremendous attention as potential low-cost energy storage alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to the intrinsic safety and great abundance of sodium. For developing competitive SIBs, highly efficient anode materials with large capacity and rapid ion diffusion are indispensable. In this study, a two-dimensional (2D) Dirac monolayer, that is, borophosphene, is proposed as a promising anode material for high performance SIBs on the basis of density functional theory calculations. The performances of Na adsorption and diffusion, maximum specific capacity, open circuit voltage, cyclical stability and electronic properties combined with Bader charge analysis are explored. It is found that borophosphene can spontaneously adsorb a Na atom with a binding energy of -0.838 eV. A low diffusion energy barrier of 0.221 eV suggests rapid ion conductivity. More intriguingly, a maximum specific capacity of 1282 mA h g-1 can be achieved in borophosphene, which is one of the largest values reported for 2D anode materials for SIBs. A low average voltage of 0.367 V is estimated, implying a suitable operating voltage of the anode material. The metallic properties, tiny surface expansion, and good kinetic stability of sodiated borophosphene give rise to high electrical conductivity and favorable cyclability. These abovementioned advantages suggest that borophosphene can be used as a Dirac anode material for SIBs with excellent performance including a large specific capacity, high-rate capability, and favorable cyclability.",

In this work, a monolithic sodium ion battery based on a Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 cathode, MoS2 layered anode, and polyether-based polymer electrolyte is reported. In addition, a new kind of polysulfonamide-supported poly(ethylene glycol) divinyl ether based polymer electrolyte is also demonstrated for monolithic sodium ion battery via in situ preparation. The resultant polymer electrolyte exhibits relatively high ionic conductivity (1.2 mS cm-1 ) at ambient temperature, wide electrochemical window (4.7 V), and favorable mechanical strength (25 MPa). Moreover, such a monolithic Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 /MoS2 sodium ion battery using this polymer electrolyte delivers outstanding rate capability (up to 10 C) and superior cyclic stability (84%) after 1000 cycles at 0.5 C. What is more essential, such a polymer electrolyte based soft-package monolithic sodium ion cell can still power a red light emitting diode lamp and run finite times without suffering from any internal short-circuit failures, even in the case of a bended and wrinkled state. Considering these aspects, this work no doubt provides a new approach for the design of a high-performance polymer electrolyte toward monolithic sodium ion battery with exceptional rate capability and high safety.",

Nonetheless, the implementation of NIBs is seriously hindered because of their low rate capability and cycling stability. This is mainly because the large ionic size of Na+ can reduce the structural stability and cause sluggish reaction kinetics of electrode materials. Herein, three-dimensional nanoarchitectured coral-like CoSe2@N-doped carbon (CL-CoSe2@NC) was synthesized through solvothermal and selenizing techniques. As a result, CL-CoSe2@NC for NIBs at 2 A g-1 exhibits an ultrahigh specific capacity of 345.4 mA h g-1 after 2800 cycles and a superhigh initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 93.1%. Ex situ XRD, HRTEM, SAED and XPS were executed to study the crystal structure evolution between Na and CoSe2 during sodiation/de-sodiation processes. The aforementioned results indicate that the improved sodium storage property of CL-CoSe2@NC could be attributed to better electrode kinetics and a stable SEI film because of the 3D nanoarchitecture and the existence of the NC layer.",

As well, carbonaceous materials, as a crucial additive, can effectively ameliorate the ion/electron conductivity of integrated composites, realizing the fast ion transport and charge transfer. Here, motivated by the enhancement effect of carbon and heterojunction on conductivity, it is proposed that the CoSe2 /WSe2 heterojunction as inner core is coated by carbon outer shell and uniformly embedded in porous carbon nanosheets (denoted as CoSe2 /WSe2 @C/CNs), which is used as anode material for SIBs. Combining with density functional theoretical calculations, it is confirmed that the structure of heterojunction can introduce built-in electric-field, which can accelerate the transportation of Na+ and improve the conductivity of electrons. Moreover, the introduction of porous carbon nanosheets (CNs) can provide a channel for the transportation of Na+ and avoid the volume expansion during Na+ insertion and extraction process.

Furthermore, the dynamical adsorption of SH with high-density negative charge on the Zn surface could serve as Zn2+ reservoirs to guide uniform Zn deposition.

The hierarchical architecture is characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. The as-obtained MgMoO4 nanoplates showed a porous structure with a pore-size distribution ranging from 50 to 70 nm. This porosity provides an electron transport pathway and enhanced surface reaction kinetics. The binding energies measured for Mg 2p, Mo 3d, 3p and O 1s are consistent with the literature, and with the metal ions being present as M(ii) and M(vi) states, respectively. This indicates that the oxidation states of the metal cations are as expected. The electrochemical behaviour of MgMoO4 was investigated using aqueous (NaOH) and non-aqueous solvents (NaClO4 in EC : DMC : FEC) for supercapacitor and battery applications. The sodium-ion capacitor involves ion absorption and insertion into the MgMoO4 electrodes resulting in superior power and energy densities. However, the cycling stability was found to be stable only for an aqueous system. The formation of a solid electrolyte surface layer restricted the reversible capacity of the MgMoO4 in the sodium-battery. Nevertheless, it does offer some promise as an anode material for storing energy with high rate performance and excellent capacity retention. Detailed comparative analyses of various electrolytes in storage devices such as hybrid sodium-ion capacitors and sodium-ion batteries are vital for the integration of hierarchical structured materials into practical applications.

        "abstract": "Conversion electrodes, which can realize high capacities by employing the wider valence states of transition metals, are investigated for sodium storage and applied for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Importantly, this work is a first report for the sodium storage ability and related storage mechanism in oxalate compounds, specifically cobalt oxalate (CoC2O4) nanorods. The nanorods are intimately blended with acetylene black powders to achieve sufficient electrical conductivity (∼10-3 S cm-1). The resulting C-CoC2O4 electrode delivers an initial capacity of about 330 mA h (g-CoC2O4)-1 at a rate of 0.2 C (60 mA g-1) and preserves 75% of the initial capacity over 200 cycles. A high charge (oxidation) capacity, ∼111 mA h g-1, was achieved even at 30 C (9000 mA g-1). This remarkable electrode performance is reported for the first time for metal oxalate compounds tested for Na cells, to the best of our knowledge. X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy analyses lead to the proposal of a new sodium storage mechanism. For this mechanism, CoC2O4 is converted into Co metal involving with the creation of Na2C2O4 on discharge (reduction), and the Co metal is recovered to CoC2O4 on charge. The employed electroconducting carbon is likely to provide good electron conduction paths, which enables fast conversion on both discharge and charge. A full cell comprised of the C-CoC2O4 anode and carbon-coated NaCrO2 cathode exhibits good retention capacity over prolonged cycling, with retention of about 84.7% of the first capacity [107 mA h (g-NaCrO2)-1] for 300 cycles, and is active at a rate of 5 C (550 mA g-1), with a capacity of 79.5 mA h g-1. This result demonstrates the potential of applying C-CoC2O4 as an anode material for rechargeable SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) possesses high energy density but often suffers from poor electrical conductivity and limited cycling stability when used as a sodium‐ion battery (SIB) anode. To address these issues, the construction of （Molybdenum trioxide‐Molybdenum disulfide）MoO3‐MoS2 heterostructures has proven effective in enhancing electronic conductivity, ion diffusion properties, and structural stability. Guided by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which predict favorable Na+ diffusion and adsorption properties, nanorod‐like MoO3‐MoS2 heterostructures are synthesized using a two‐step method. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of the heterostructure and nanosized morphology, the resulting MoO3‐MoS2 electrode exhibits outstanding rate performance (316 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1) and long‐lasting cycling stability (286 mA h g−1 after 2300 cycles at 5 A g−1) as an SIB anode. In situ XRD measurements reveal that the ultrahigh specific capacity of MoO3‐MoS2 is attributed to the synergistic intercalation‐conversion storage of MoO3 and MoS2. In the pursuit of meeting commercialization requirements, electrodes with adjustable mass loading are also prepared using 3D printing, showcasing the high areal capacity characteristics of the SIBs. This study not only provides theoretical insights into expanding the use of heterojunction materials as SIB anodes but also demonstrates the significant potential for creating high‐energy‐density and cost‐effective SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Emerging sodium‐ion batteries (NIBs) and potassium‐ion batteries (KIBs) show promise in complementing lithium‐ion battery (LIB) technology and diversifying the battery market. Hard carbon is a potential anode candidate for LIBs, NIBs, and KIBs due to its high capacity, sustainability, wide availability, and stable physicochemical properties. Herein, a series of hard carbons is synthesized by hydrothermal carbonization and subsequent pyrolysis at different temperatures to finely tune their structural properties. When tested as anodes, the hard carbons exhibit differing ion‐storage trends for Li, Na, and K, with NIBs achieving the highest reversible capacity. Extensive materials and electrochemical characterizations are carried out to study the correlation of structural features with electrochemical performance and to explain the specific mechanisms of alkali‐ion storage in hard carbons. In addition, the best‐performing hard carbon is tested against a sodium cathode Na3V2(PO4)3 in a Na‐ion pouch cell, displaying a high power density of 2172 W kg−1 at an energy density of 181.5 Wh kg−1 (based on the total weight of active materials in both anode and cathode).

Practical deployment of NiCo2 S4 electrode in SIBs, however, is still hindered by the inferior capacity and unsatisfactory cycling performance, which result from the mismatch between the electrolyte chemistry and electrode. Herein, a functional electrolyte containing 1.0 m NaCF3 SO3 in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME) (1.0 m NaCF3 SO3 -DEGDME) is developed, which can be readily used for NiCo2 S4 anode with high initial coulomb efficiency (96.2%), enhanced cycling performance, and boosted capacities (341.7 mA h g-1 after 250 continuous cycles at the current density of 200 mA g-1 ). The electrochemical tests and related phase characterization combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicate the ether-based electrolyte is more suitable for the NiCo2 S4 anode in SIBs due to the formation of a stable electrode-electrolyte interface. Additionally, the importance of the voltage window is also demonstrated to further optimize the electrochemical performance of the NiCo2 S4 electrode. The formation of sulfide intermediates during charging and discharging is predicted by combining DFT and verified by in situ XRD and HRTEM.

The size of the TiO2 particles is controlled to ∼35-40 nm, with almost even distribution on the MWCNTs surface. The nanostructuring and appropriate doping of cost-effective manganese into the TiO2 host improved the electrochemical performance in terms of high rate capability and specific capacity for both the rechargeable battery systems. For the LIBs, the charge capacity of the 5% Mn-TiO2/MWCNT anode is 226.3 mA h g-1 in the first cycle, and is retained at 176.4 mA h g-1 after 80 cycles as compared with the SIBs, in which the charge capacity is 152.1 mA h g-1 in the first cycle, and is retained at 121.4 mA h g-1 after 80 cycles. After testing the electrodes at a high current rate of 20C, the nanocomposite electrode can still demonstrate charge capacities of 131.2 and 117.2 mA h g-1 at a 0.1C rate for LIBs and SIBs, respectively. The incorporation of Mn-ions (2+, 4+) is found to play a crucial role in terms of defects and vacancy creation, increasing conduction band electrons and lattice expansion to facilitate alkali metal ion diffusion for superior electrochemical performance. The combination of heteroatom doping and use of a highly conductive additive in the form of MWCNTs has resulted in excellent electrode integrity, high ion accessibility, and fast electron transport.

        "abstract": "LiNixMnyCozO2 cathode materials combined with Si‐based anode materials are current state‐of‐the‐art high energy density chemistries for lithium ion batteries. Increasing the upper cut‐off voltage is an intriguing approach to achieve even higher energy density in lithium ion batteries. However, poor oxidation stability of the state‐of‐the‐art electrolytes leads to transition metal dissolution (TMD), migration, and deposition (TMDMD) on the negative electrode, followed by sudden and rapid capacity fade. Furthermore, the chemical instability of the lithium hexafluorophosphate causes hydro‐fluoric acid to develop, which targets the native SiOx layers on silicon anodes and breaks the chemical bond to the carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt binder. Herein, a fluorine‐rich electrolyte formulation consisting of lithium‐bis(fluorsulfonyl)imide with fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC): bis(2,2,2,) trifluoroethyl carbonate (BFEC) was applied in NMC811||10%SiOx‐90%graphite cells to achieve high oxidation stability and prevent TMD and deposition.

Herein, we report a high-performance Na-ion hybrid capacitor based on interface engineered hierarchical TiO2 nanosheet anode consisting of bronze (~ 15%) and anatase (~ 85%) crystallites (~ 10 nm). This pseudocapacitive dual-phase anode demonstrated exceptional specific capacity of 289 mAh g-1@ 0.025 A g-1, and excellent rate capability (110 mAh g-1@ 1.0 A g-1). Na-ion hybrid capacitor integrating dual-phase hierarchical TiO2 nanosheet anode and activated carbon cathode exhibited a high energy density of 200 Wh kg-1 (based on the total mass of active materials in both electrodes) and power density of 6191 W kg-1. These values are in the energy and power density range of Li-ion batteries (100-300 Wh kg-1) and supercapacitors (5000-15000 W kg-1) respectively. Furthermore, exceptional capacity retention of 80% is observed after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. Outstanding electrochemical performance of the demonstrated Na-ion hybrid capacitor is credited to the enhanced pseudocapacitive Na-ion intercalation of two-dimensional TiO2 anode resulting from nanointerfaces between bronze and anatase crystallites.

Here, substantially boosted Na+ ion transport and charge transfer kinetics are demonstrated by constructing a near-ideal non-rectifying titanium carbonitride/nitrogen-doped TiO2 (TiCx N1- x /N-TiO2 ) heterostructure. Owing to the fast plasma effects and metastable hybrid phases, the TiCx N1- x is epitaxially grown on TiO2 . Energy band engineering at the interface induces high electron densities and a strong built-in electric field, which lowers the Na+ diffusion barrier by a factor of 1.7. As a result, the TiCx N1- x /N-TiO2 electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. The reversible specific capacities at rates of 0.1 and 10 C reach 312.3 and 173.7 mAh g-1 , respectively. After 600 cycles of charge and discharge at 10 C, the capacity retention rate is 98.7%.

The above-mentioned issues are closely related to Na+ transfer kinetics, surface chemistry, and internal pseudo-graphitic carbon content. Herein, constructing molybdenum-modified hard carbon solid spheres (Mo2C/HC-5.0), both the ion transfer kinetics, surface chemistry, and internal pseudo-graphitic carbon content are comprehensively improved. Specifically, Mo2C/HC-5.0 with higher pseudo-graphitic carbon content provides a large number of active sites and a more stable layer structure, resulting in improved sodium storage capacity, rate performance, and cycling stability. Moreover, the lower defect density and specific surface area of Mo2C/HC-5.0 further enhance ICE and sodium storage capacity. Consequently, the Mo2C/HC-5.0 anode achieves a high capacity of 410.7 mA h g-1 and an ICE of 83.9% at 50 mA g-1. Furthermore, the material exhibits exceptional rate capability and cycling stability, maintaining a capacity of 202.8 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1 and 214.9 mA h g-1 after 800 cycles at 1 A g-1.",

        "abstract": "Antimony (Sb) has been pursued as a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, it suffers from severe volume expansion during the sodiation-desodiation process. Encapsulating Sb into a carbon matrix can effectively buffer the volume change of Sb. However, the sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics in traditional carbon shells is still a bottleneck for achieving high-rate performance in Sb/C composite materials. Here we design and synthesize a yolk-shell Sb@Void@graphdiyne (GDY) nanobox (Sb@Void@GDY NB) anode for high-rate and long cycle life SIBs. The intrinsic in-plane cavities in GDY shells offer three-dimensional Na+ transporting channels, enabling fast Na+ diffusion through the GDY shells. Electrochemical kinetics analyses show that the Sb@Void@GDY NBs exhibit faster Na+ transport kinetics than traditional Sb@C NBs. In situ transmission electron microscopy analysis reveals that the hollow structure and the void space between Sb and GDY successfully accommodate the volume change of Sb during cycling, and the plastic GDY shell maintains the structural integrity of NBs. Benefiting from the above structural merits, the Sb@Void@GDY NBs exhibit excellent rate capability and extraordinary cycling stability.",

However, the applications of organic electrode materials are still limited because of their dissolution in electrolytes and low electrical conductivity, which in turn cause poor cycling stability. Here, for the first time, we report 2-amino-4-thiazole-acetic acid (ATA) and its sodium salt, sodium 2-amino-4-thiazol-derived polymer (PATANa), as an anode. The PATANa showed a two-dimensional (2D) nanosheet structure, offering a larger contact area with the electrolyte and a shorter ion-migration path, which improved the ion-diffusion kinetics. The polymer showed excellent cycling stability and outstanding rate capability when tested as an anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). It could deliver a high reversible specific capacity of 303 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 for 100 cycles and maintain a high discharge capacity of 190 mA h g-1 after 1000 long cycle numbers even at a high current density of 1000 mA g-1.

However, the design and development of highly efficient SIBs represent a great challenge. Here, a unique and reliable approach is reported to prepare carbon nitride (CN) hybridized with nickel iron sulfide (NFCN) using simple reaction between Ni-Fe layered double hydroxide and dithiooxamide. The characterization results demonstrate that the hybridization with optimal amount of CN induces local distortion in the crystal structure of the hybrid, which would benefit SIB performance. Systematic electrochemical studies with a half-cell configuration show that the present hybrid structure exhibits a promising reversible specific capacity of 348 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles with good rate capability. Simulation result reveals that the iron atoms in nickel iron sulfide act as a primary active site to accommodate Na+ ions. At last, with a full cell configuration using NFCN and Na3 V2 (PO4 )2 O2 F as the anode and cathode, respectively, the specific capacity appears to be ≈95 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 condition.

        "abstract": "Graphene/metal oxides (G/MO) composite materials have attracted much attention as the anode of sodium ion batteries (SIBs), because of the high theoretical capacity. However, most metal oxides operate based on the conversion mechanism and the alloying mechanism has changed to Na2O after the first cycle. The influence of G/Na2O (G/N) on the subsequent sodiation process has never been clearly elucidated. In this work, we report a systematic investigation on the G/N interface from both aspects of theoretical simulation and experiment characterization. By applied first-principles simulations, we find that the sluggish kinetics in the G/MO materials is mainly caused by the high diffusion barrier (0.51 eV) inside the Na2O bulk, while the G/N interface shows a much faster transport kinetics (0.25 eV) via unique double-interstitialcy mechanism. G/N interface possesses an interfacial storage of Na atom through the charge separation mechanism. The experimental evidence confirms that high interfacial ratio structure of G/N greatly improves the rate performance and endows G/MO materials the interfacial storage. Furthermore, the experimental investigation finds that the high interfacial ratio structure of G/N also benefits from the reversible reaction between SnO2 and Sn during cycling. Lastly, the effects of (N, O, S) doping in graphene systems at the G/N interface were also explored. This work provides a fundamental comprehension on the G/MO interface structure during the sodiation process, which is helpful to design energy storage materials with high rate performance and large capacity.",

Eliminating this phase transition by the control of cutoff voltages successfully extends the cycle life of μ-Sn to 2500 cycles at 2 A g-1, much longer than ∼40 cycles in a regular voltage window. The specific capacity is still retained at ∼455 mAh g-1, leading to a capacity decay of only ∼0.0088% per cycle.

Herein, a facile and green strategy for yolk-shell structure based on the principle of metal evaporation is proposed. SnS2 nanoparticle is encapsulated in nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanobox (SnS2 @C). The carbon nanoboxes accommodate the volume change and aggregation of SnS2 during cycling, and form 3D continuous conductive carbon matrix by close contact. The well-designed structure benefits greatly in conductivity and structural stability of the material. As expected, SnS2 @C exhibits considerable capacity, superior cycling stability, and excellent rate capability in both SIBs and PIBs.

Bi2S3 acted as the dominating active material, in consideration of the low content of TiO2, which ensured the high capacity of the composite. The dual-structural restrain of the TiO2 and PPy coatings can effectively alleviate volume variation based on the pseudo-\"zero-strain\" effect of TiO2 and high flexibility of PPy shells.

Custom-designed organic materials have been pursued as sustainable alternative electrodes for sodium-ion batteries, offering a solution that bypasses the need for traditional high-temperature synthesis. However, the challenge lies in achieving the desired electrochemical properties through precise structural modulation and the incorporation of redox-active functional groups. In this study, a triptycene-based microporous organic ladder polymer is developed featuring redox-active quinone moieties, designed as an anode material for high-performance sodium-ion batteries. The vertically aligned quinone moieties in the porous ladder polymer prevent the eclipsed stacking of layers, thereby enhancing the exposure of electroactive sites to electrolyte ions. Additionally, the ladder polymer exhibits almost unimodal pores due to its structural rigidity, facilitating fast Na+ ion diffusion. The redox-active quinone moieties host Na+ ions, and the microporosity supports capacitive ion storage. Consequently, a high reversible specific capacity of 316 mAh g-1 has been achieved.

The control of surface chemistry is an effective approach for preparing novel MXenes and modifying their electrochemical properties. However, an in-depth and systematic atomic-scale study of the effect of surface termination on MXene stability and electrochemical performance is scarce and thus is highly desired. Here, through high-throughput first-principles calculations, 28 stable chalcogen-functionalized M2 CTz (M = V, Nb, and Ta, T = S, Se, and Te) under different chemical environments are identified. The reduction of termination coverage improves electrical conductivity but weakens in-plane stiffness. Intriguingly, based on charge transfer mechanism, the diffusion barrier of lithium/sodium atoms on the M2 CTz exhibits a volcano-like relationship with termination coverage, and the ion diffusion channel formed in half termination coverage greatly accelerates lithium ion diffusion and returns to or exceeds sodium ion diffusion rate at full termination coverage. V2 CSe2 /Nb2 CSz not only displays the large lithium/sodium capacity (592/409-466 mAhg-1 ) but also exhibits low barrier energy and open-circuit voltage, suggesting a promising candidate anode material for lithium/sodium-ion batteries.

As such, remarkable cycling stability is achieved for 4.3‐V Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) cathodes with 83.3% capacity retention over 3000 cycles at 1 C, significantly outperforming the carbonate counterpart (41.6% capacity retention). Meanwhile, the restrained SEI growth via reducing the formation of electron‐leaking Na2CO3 stabilizes the long‐term cycling of the hard carbon (HC) anode. The assembled NVOPF||HC full cells achieve superior rate capability (up to 15 C) and stable cycling stability over 500 cycles.

        "abstract": "Organic compounds have been utilized in rechargeable batteries as electrode materials on account of their designable structures and reversible redox properties. However, most of them suffer from problems with dissolution resulting in poor electrochemical performance. In this work, we adapt a sodium salt of tetracyanoquinodimethane (NaTCNQ) to work as a high redox potential cathode material in sodium ion batteries (SIBs). A porous carbon coated separator is demonstrated to be an adsorption layer and prevents the dissolved active material from migrating to the anode side. The NaTCNQ cell assembled with a carbon layer containing 5% activated carbon (AC) exhibits a higher initial capacity and greatly improved cycling stability. Using a conductive adsorption layer in organic redox batteries is a promising pathway to develop high performance organic electrode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) offer several benefits, including cost-efficiency and fast-charging characteristics, positioning them as attractive substitutes for lithium-ion batteries in energy storage applications. However, the inferior capacity and cycling stability of electrodes in SIBs necessitate further enhancement due to sluggish reaction kinetics. In this respect, the utilization of heterostructures, which can provide an inherent electric field and abundant active sites on the surface, has emerged as a promising strategy for augmenting the cycling stability and rate features of the electrodes. This work delves into the utilization of V1.13Se2/V2O3 heterostructure materials as anodes, initially fabricated via a simplified one-step solid-state sintering technique. The high pseudocapacitance and low characteristic relaxation time constant give the V1.13Se2/V2O3 heterostructure impressive properties, such as a high capacity of 328.5 mAh g-1 even after 1500 cycles at a high current density of 2 A g-1 and rate capability of 278.9 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1. Moreover, the assembled sodium-ion full battery delivers a capacity of 118.5 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1. These findings provide novel insight and guidance for the rapid synthesis of heterojunction materials and the advancement of SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The development of sodium ion battery (SIBs) is hindered by the rapid reduction in reversible capacity of the carbon-based anode materials. The outside-in doping on carbon-based anode has been extensively explored. Whereas nickel and NiS2 particles embedded nitrogen and sulfur co-doped porous graphene can significantly improve the electrochemical performance, we report a build-in heteroatom \"self-doping\" on albumen derived graphene for sodium storage. The build-in sulfur and nitrogen in albumen act as the doping source during the carbonization of proteins. The S-rich proteins in the albumen can also guide the doping and nucleation of the nickel sulfide nanoparticles. Besides, the porous architecture of the carbonized proteins is achieved through the removable KCl/NaCl salts (medium) at high-temperature melting conditions. And during the carbonization process, the nitrogen can reduce the carbonization temperature of thermally stable carbon materials.

For the first time, we report a reliable hydrothermal method for the preparation of red phosphorus quantum dots (RPQDs) with commercial red P as a source. Moreover, an effective strategy was designed to fabricate RPQDs/rGO nanohybrids for addressing the intrinsic issues of red P as anode materials for SIBs. Benefiting from the nanostructuring of red P and the coupling of RPQDs with rGO, the obtained nanohybrids not only promote electron and ion transfer, but also effectively enhance the electronic conductivity, restrain the aggregation of RPQDs and buffer the large volume changes of red phosphorus during the charge-discharge process. The nanohybrids deliver an initial specific capacity of 1161 mA h g-1 and a low capacity deterioration rate of less than 0.12% per cycle even after 250 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g-1. The feasibility of large-scale production of the RPQDs/rGO nanohybrid, associated with its outstanding Na-ion storage properties and low cost, demonstrates that the RPQDs/rGO hybrid is a very promising anode material for SIBs.",

However, many challenges remain for development of SIBs with high specific capacity, high rate capability, and long cycle life. Therefore, CuS as an important earth-abundant, low-cost semiconductor was applied as anode of SIBs with ether-based electrolyte instead of conventional ester-based electrolyte. By incorporating reduced graphene oxide (RGO) into CuS nanosheets and optimizing the cutoff voltage, it is found that the sodium-ion storage performance can be greatly enhanced using ether-based electrolyte. The CuS-RGO composites deliver an initial Coulombic efficiency of 94% and a maximum specific capacity of 392.9 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g-1. And a specific capacity of 345 mAh g-1 is kept after 450 cycles at a current density of 1 A g-1. Such an excellent electrochemical performance is ascribed to the conductive network construction of CuS-RGO composites, the suppression of dissolved polysulfide intermediates by using ether-based electrolyte, and the avoidance of conversion-type reaction by optimizing the cutoff voltage.",

The construction of highly conductive copper-carbon wall facilitates fast electrons and ions transportation, while the interconnected and ordered porous structure not only creates enough space to resist the expansion effect of RP but also minimizes the ion diffusion length and enhances ion accessibility (the ion migration coefficient is ten times that of disordered porous carbon).

Uric acid (UA), a simple organic compound with three carbonyl groups is demonstrated to be electrochemically active in the insertion/extraction of Na ions. Theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations reveal that the sodium-ion storage by UA is a result of the stepwise mechanisms of p-π conjugation and the carbon anion. Aside from C═O, the functional group C═C(NH-)2 also provides an efficient Na-storage activated site in which the lone-pair electrons is stabilized through the planar-to-tetrahedral structural transition and low-energy orbital hybridization of N atoms.

When employed as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries, the UA@CNT composite exhibits high specific capacity, excellent rate capability, and long cycling life even at high current densities. A reversible capacity of over 163 mA h g-1 is maintained even after 150 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g-1.

The synthesized cathode exhibited hexagonal, 2D platelets with an ∼300 nm thickness. During the anodic and cathodic sweeps, the cyclic voltammograms revealed multiple redox peaks with the same current densities, shapes, and peak positions, associated with the highly reversible phase transition mechanism of the layered P2-type NaCoO2 cathode. The sodium cells yielded the capacities of 93/92 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C and 87/87 mAh g-1 at 1 C for the 50th charge-discharge cycles. The in situ multimode calorimetry (MMC) studies of sodium cells demonstrated a thermal explosion event, which occurred by sodium melting, short-circuit, electrode decomposition reaction, gas generation, exothermic reaction, released heat energy ,and cell gasket melting. Ultimately, the calculated released total heat energies of ∼550/740 J g-1 for in situ MMC studies and ∼312/594 J g-1 for ex situ DSC analyses (charge state at 4 V and discharge state at 2 V) show that the discharged state of sodiated layered P2-type NaCoO2 cathode material is more unsafe than the charge state. Furthermore, the ex situ differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) spectrum of a discharge state at 2 V of layered P2-type NaCoO2 revealed a decreased onset temperature (DOT) at 141 °C with two pronounced exothermic peaks at 197 and 266 °C with a released higher total heat energy of 594 J g-1 than the charge state heat energy at 312 J g-1, attributed to the higher charge onset temperature (COT) at 191 °C. Thus, the observed higher heat energy and decreased onset temperature for the discharge state at 2 V is associated with the higher Na+ ion in the discharge state of the layered P2-type NaxCoO2 cathode than that of the pristine cathode, showcasing that the layered P2-type NaCoO2 cathode is unsafe at the discharged condition for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Organic carboxyl compounds are promising anode candidates for lithium ion batteries in which oxygen-related redox dominates the reaction mechanisms. Herein, two nanostructured organic electrodes of π-extended naphthyl-based dicarboxylate and dithiocarboxylate compounds, namely sodium naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylate (SND) and sodium naphthalene-2,6-bis(carbothioate) (SNB) are first synthesized and investigated systematically for lithium ion battery. Through introducing less electronegative sulfur atoms into carboxylic groups at molecular level, SNB exhibits a different voltage profile and delivers higher reversible capacity of 280 mAh g-1 than SND (198 mAh g-1) at a current density of 50 mA g-1. A combination of electrochemical properties and DFT calculations reveals that SNB could reversibly store three Li+ per formula unit, while SND only stores two Li+. The present work offers a new strategy to develop redox molecules with tunable redox potentials and accommodation more alkaline ions for high performance battery systems.",

        "abstract": "Seeking an optimal catalyst to accelerate conversion reaction kinetics of room‐temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries is crucial for improving their electrochemical performance and promoting the practical applications. Herein, theoretical calculations of interfacial interactions of catalysts and polysulfides in terms of the surface adsorption state, interfacial ions migration, and electronic concentration around the Fermi level are systematically proposed as guiding principles of catalyst selection for RT Na–S batteries. As a case, MoN catalyst is accurately selected from transition metal nitrides with different d orbital electrons, and for experiment, it is introduced into the carbon nanofibers as a dual‐functioning host (MoN@CNFs). The MoN@CNFs can effectively anchor polysulfides and accelerate their conversion reaction. In addition, for the sodium anode, the MoN@CNFs can also induce uniform deposition of Na and inhibit dendrite growth, which are supported by in situ characterizations and finite element simulation technique. As a result, the as‐prepared RT Na–S battery displays high reversible capacity of 990 mAh g–1 at 0.2 A g–1 after 100 cycles and long lifespan over 1500 cycles at 2 A g–1. Even with high S loading of 5 mg cm–2, the RT Na–S battery still exhibits a high areal capacity of 2.5 mAh cm–2.",

        "abstract": "Heteroatom doping is an effective method to improve the electrochemical properties of hard carbon anodes for sodium-ion batteries. However, the different roles of surface and bulk heteroatoms in Na storage have not been explored much. Herein, N, P dual-doped carbon nanofibers (NP-CNFs) with high doping contents and low surface area are designed to clarify the above issue. It is confirmed that P plays a more crucial role in Na storage compared with N. In addition, surface and bulk P not only possess different configurations but also show distinct Na storage activity. There are only oxidized POx groups on the surface, which are inactive for Na storage but promote the stability of electrochemistry interphase, while in the bulk phase, unoxidized P-C bonds also emerge except POx, which shows preeminently reversible Na storage activity, and the POx groups are activated simultaneously. Furthermore, P-doping changes the reactivity of N-configurations with Na both on the surface and in the bulk phase, exhibiting interesting synergism. As expected, the surface stability, bulk activity, and synergism enable NP-CNFs to achieve superior performance. It could deliver a prominent capacity of 105.6 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 after 3000 cycles in half cells and 164.3 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 200 cycles in full cells.",

        "abstract": "Biomass-derived hard carbon is a promising anode material for commercial sodium-ion batteries due to its low cost, high capacity, and stable cycling performance. However, the intrinsic tight lignocellulosic structure in biomass hinders the formation of sufficient closed pores, limiting the specific capacity of obtained hard carbons. In this contribution, a mild, industrially mature pretreatment method is utilized to selectively regulate biomass components. The hard carbon with a rich closed pore structure is prepared by optimizing the appropriate ratio of biomass composition. Optimized etching conditions enhanced the closed pore volume of hard carbon from 0.15 to 0.26 cm3 g-1. Consequently, the engineered hard carbon exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, including a high reversible capacity of 346 mAh g-1 with a high plateau capacity of 254 mAh g⁻¹ at 50 mA g⁻¹, robust rate capability, and cycling stability. The optimized hard carbon shows an 88 mAh g⁻¹ increase in plateau capacity compared to hard carbon from directly carbonizing bamboo fibers. This mature approach provides an easy-to-operate industrial pathway for designing high-capacity biomass-based hard carbons for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, all‐solid‐state batteries (ASSBs) with metal anodes have witnessed significant developments due to their high energy and power density as well as their excellent safety record. While intergranular dendritic lithium growth in inorganic solid electrolytes (SEs) has been extensively studied for lithium ASSBs, comparable knowledge is missing for sodium‐based ASSBs. Therefore, polycrystalline Na‐β″‐alumina is employed as a SE model material to investigate the microstructural influence on sodium filament growth during deposition of sodium metal at the anode. The research focuses on the relationship between the microstructure, in particular grain boundary (GB) type and orientation, sodium filament growth, and sodium ion transport, utilizing in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements in combination with crystal orientation analysis. The effect of the anisotropic sodium ion transport at/across GBs depending on the orientation of the sodium ion transport planes and the applied electric field on the current distribution and the position of sodium filament growth is explored. The in situ TEM analysis is validated by large field of view post‐mortem secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS) analysis, in which sodium filament growth within voids and along grain boundaries is observed, contributing to the sodium network formation potentially leading to failure of batteries.",

        "title": "Adsorption and Diffusion of Lithium and Sodium on Defective Rhenium Disulfide: A First Principles Study.",
        "abstract": "Single-layer rhenium disulfide (ReS2) is a unique material with distinctive, anisotropic electronic, mechanical, and optical properties and has the potential to be used as an anode in alkali-metal-ion batteries. In this work, first principles calculations were performed to systematically evaluate the potential of monolayer pristine and defective ReS2 as anodes in lithium (Li)- and sodium (Na)-ion batteries. Our calculations suggest that there are several potential adsorption sites for Li and Na on pristine ReS2, owing to its low-symmetry structure. Additionally, the adsorption of Li and Na over pristine ReS2 is very strong with adsorption energies of -2.28 and -1.71 eV, respectively. Interestingly, the presence of point defects causes significantly stronger binding of the alkali-metal atoms with adsorption energies in the range -2.98 to -3.17 eV for Li and -2.66 to -2.92 eV for Na. Re single vacancy was found to be the strongest binding defect for Li adsorption, whereas S single vacancy was found to be the strongest for Na. The diffusion of these two alkali atoms over pristine ReS2 is anisotropic, with an energy barrier of 0.33 eV for Li and 0.16 eV for Na. The energy barriers associated with escaping a double vacancy and single vacancy for Li atoms are significantly large at 0.60 eV for the double-vacancy case and 0.51 eV for the single-vacancy case. Similarly, for Na, they are 0.59 and 0.47 eV, respectively, which indicates slower migration and sluggish charging/discharging. However, the diffusion energy barrier over a Re single vacancy is found to be merely 0.42 eV for a Li atom and 0.28 eV for Na. Overall, S single and double vacancies can reduce the diffusion rate by 103-105 times for Li and Na ions, respectively. These results suggest that monolayer ReS2 with a Re single vacancy adsorbs Li and Na stronger than pristine ReS2, with negligible negotiation with the charging/discharging rate of the battery, and therefore they can be used as an anode in Li- and Na-ion batteries.",

The synthesized MA-VA-PcNi polymer is used as the anode for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries, exhibiting excellent energy storage behaviors. The MA-VA-PcNi/Li battery displays a high capacity of 610 mA h g-1 and can still remain at 507 mA h g-1 with a retention rate of 83.1% after 400 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g-1. Even at a high current density of 2 A g-1, the specific capacity can remain at 195 mA h g-1.

A high specific capacity of 164 mA h g-1 can also be achieved at a high current density of 1 A g-1. After nickel phthalocyanine (PcNi) was grafted onto the MA-VA polymer, aggregation between phthalocyanine rings was effectively prevented, and this exposes more active sites. At the same time, the spherical particles obtained by electrospinning technology further improve the dispersion and increase the number of active sites of the active materials. Finally, the electrode materials show excellent energy storage behavior for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries, which provides a new idea for designing high-performance energy storage materials for organic electrodes.",

The Bi0.75Sb0.25 arrays exhibit an appreciable electrochemical robustness for sodium storage, sustaining a reversible capability 335 mAh g-1 at a high rate of 2.5 A g-1, and 87% of the initial capacity over 2,000 cycles. We further demonstrate the applicability of the Bi0.75Sb0.25 array anode in sodium full cells by pairing it with a Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode. This full cell achieves a high specific energy of 203 Wh kg-1 (based on both active electrodes). Such an enhanced performance is attributed to the unique thorny-durian-like architecture and bimetallic alloy composition. The pyramid tip induces ion enrichment for rapid charge-transfer reaction, while the alloy design reduces the electrode volume swelling for stable Na cycling.",

In particular, the huge volume change of Si makes it very challenging to simultaneously achieve high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and long-term cycle life. Herein, we report spray pyrolysis to prepare Si-SiOx composite using an aqueous precursor solution containing Si nanoparticles, citric acid, and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). In the precursor solution, Si nanoparticles are etched by NaOH with the production of [SiO4]4-. During the dynamic course of spray pyrolysis, [SiO4]4- transforms to SiOx matrix and citric acid decomposes to carbon surface layer with the assistance of NaOH that serves as a decomposition catalyst. As a result, a Si-SiOx composite, in which Si nanodomains are homogeneously embedded in the SiOx matrix with carbon surface layer, is generated by a one-pot process with a residence time of only 3.5 s in a flow reactor. The optimal composite structure in terms of Si domain size and Si-to-O ratio exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, such as reversible capacity of 1561.9 mAh g-1 at 0.06C rate and ICE of 80.2% and 87.9% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1C rate.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon is considered the most commercially viable anode material for sodium ion batteries due to its excellent sodium storage properties. However, the production cost of hard carbon is high, so optimizing the electrochemical performance of coal-derived hard carbon is adopted. However, due to the dense structure of coal, it is difficult to prepare closed pores inside the coal-derived hard carbon, which is not conducive to increasing capacity. Therefore, we propose Zn2(OH)2CO3 assisted ball milling pretreatment followed by carbonization to generate closed pores in coal-derived hard carbon. The reason for the formation of closed pores is that the uniform pores on the coal surface generated by the wear and etching of Zn2(OH)2CO3 are repaired at high temperatures. Via mechanism characterization, we verified that the plateau capacity is related to the filling of sodium ions in closed pores. Therefore, the as-prepared coal-derived hard carbon delivers a high capacity of 325.3 mA h g-1 (plateau capacity accounting for 45.1%) at a current density of 0.03 A g-1 with a capacity retention rate of 83.5% over 500 cycles.

High capacity anode materials, such as phosphorus, have been explored to realize Na-ion battery technologies that offer comparable performances to their Li-ion counterparts. While P anodes provide unparalleled capacities, the mechanism of sodiation and desodiation is not well-understood, limiting further optimization. Here, we use a combined experimental and theoretical approach to provide molecular-level insight into the (de)sodiation pathways in black P anodes for sodium-ion batteries. A determination of the P binding in these materials was achieved by comparing to structure models created via species swapping, ab initio random structure searching, and a genetic algorithm. During sodiation, analysis of 31P chemical shift anisotropies in NMR data reveals P helices and P at the end of chains as the primary structural components in amorphous Na xP phases. X-ray diffraction data in conjunction with variable field 23Na magic-angle spinning NMR support the formation of a new Na3P crystal structure (predicted using density-functional theory) on sodiation. During desodiation, P helices are re-formed in the amorphous intermediates, albeit with increased disorder, yet emphasizing the pervasive nature of this motif. The pristine material is not re-formed at the end of desodiation and may be linked to the irreversibility observed in the Na-P system.",

The NiS2 anode also exhibits excellent high-rate capability (253 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1 ) and long-term cycling performance (319 mA h g-1 capacity remained even after 1000 cycles at 0.5 A g-1 ). A dominant pseudocapacitance contribution is identified and verified by kinetics analysis. In addition, the amorphization and conversion reactions during the electrochemical process of the mesoporous NiS2 nanospheres is also investigated by in situ X-ray diffraction. The impressive electrochemical performance reveals that the NiS2 offers great potential toward the development of next generation large scale energy storage.",

        "abstract": "The enhancement of the structural stability of conversion-based metal sulfides at high current densities remains a major challenge in realizing the practical application of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The instability of metal sulfides is caused by the large volume variation and sluggish reaction kinetics upon sodiation/desodiation. To overcome this, herein, a heterostructured nanocube anode composed of CuS/FeS2 embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon (CuS/FeS2 @NC) is synthesized. Size- and shape-controlled porous carbon nanocubes containing metallic nanoparticles are synthesized by the two-step pyrolysis of a bimetallic Prussian blue analog (PBA) precursor. The simple sulfurization-induced formation of highly conductive CuS along with FeS2 facilitates sodium-ion diffusion and enhances the redox reversibility upon cycling. The mesoporous carbon structure provides excellent electrolyte impregnation, efficient charge transport pathways, and good volume expansion buffering. The CuS/FeS2 @NC nanocube anode exhibits excellent sodium storage characteristics including high desodiation capacity (608 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 ), remarkable long-term cycle life (99.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 5 A g-1 ), and good rate capability up to 5 A g-1 . The simple, facile synthetic route combined with the rational design of bimetallic PBA nanostructures can be widely utilized in the development of conversion-based metal sulfides and other high-capacity anode materials for high-performance SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Silicon oxide-based (SiOx-based) materials show great promise as anodes for high-energy lithium-ion batteries due to their high specific capacity. However, their practical application is hindered by the inevitable volumetric expansion during the lithiation/delithiation process. Constructing high-performance binders for SiOx-based anodes has been regarded as an efficient strategy to mitigate their volume expansion and preserve structural integrity. In this work, we propose a green water-solution PAA-LS binder composed of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and sodium lignosulfonate (LS) with fast self-healing properties. The designed binder can be restored due to the strong affinity between Fe3+-catechol coordination bonds, thereby effectively alleviating the volumetric strain of SiOx-based anodes. Notably, with an optimized LS content of 0.5%, the SiOx@PAA-LS electrode exhibits excellent performance, delivering a high capacity of 997.3 mAh g-1 after 450 cycles at 0.5 A g-1. Furthermore, the SiOx||NCM622 full cell also demonstrates superior cycling stability, maintaining a discharge capacity of 147.58 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g-1, with an impressive capacity retention rate of 82.72%.",

EP has been used to characterise LIBs; here, we demonstrate the first application of EP to any NIB material. The voltage versus sodiation fraction curves (voltage profiles) of hard carbon lack clear features, consisting only of a slope and a plateau, making it difficult to clarify the structural features of hard carbon that could optimise cell performance. We find additional features through EP that are masked in the voltage profiles. We fit lattice gas models of hard carbon sodiation to experimental EP and system enthalpy, obtaining: 1. a theoretical maximum capacity, 2. interlayer versus pore filled sodium with state of charge.",

        "abstract": "Biomass-derived hard carbon materials are attractive for sodium-ion batteries due to their abundance, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness. However, their widespread use is hindered by their limited specific capacity. Herein, a type of bamboo-derived hard carbon with adjustable pore structures is developed by employing a ball milling technique to modify the carbon chain length in the precursor. It is observed that the length of the carbon chain in the precursor can effectively control the rearrangement behavior of the carbon layers during the high-temperature carbonization process, resulting in diverse pore structures ranging from closed pores to open pores, which significantly impact the electrochemical properties. The optimized hard carbon with abundant closed pores exhibits a high specific capacity of 356 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1, surpassing that of bare hard carbon (243 mAh g-1) and hard carbon with abundant open pores (129 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1). However, the kinetic analysis reveals that hard carbon with open pores shows better sodium-ion diffusion kinetics, indicating that a balance between the closed and open pores should be considered. This research offers valuable insights into pore design and presents a promising approach for enhancing the performance of hard carbon anode materials derived from biomass precursors.",

        "abstract": "The attractive advantages of the Zn metal anode and water-based electrolyte, such as inherent safety and low cost, endow the zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) with great potential in the future energy storage market. However, the severe surface side reactions and dendrites affect the service lifespan and electrochemical performance of ZIBs. Herein, a bifunctional electrolyte additive, l-ascorbic acid sodium (LAA), has been added into ZnSO4 (ZSO) electrolyte (ZSO + LAA) to settle the above issues of ZIBs. On the one hand, the LAA additive tends to adsorb on the Zn anode surface to generate a H2O-resistive passivation layer, which can effectively isolate the H2O corrosion and regulate the Zn2+ ion 3D diffusion, thus inducing a uniform deposition layer. On the other hand, the strong adsorption capacity between LAA and Zn2+ can transform the solvated [Zn(H2O)6]2+ into [Zn(H2O)4LAA], thus reducing the coordinated H2O molecules and further suppressing side reactions. With this synergy effect, the Zn/Zn symmetric battery with the ZSO + LAA electrolyte can deliver a cycle life of 1200 h under 1 mA cm-2, and the Zn/Ti battery also presents an ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency of 99.16% under 1 mA cm-2, greatly superior to the batteries with the ZSO electrolyte.

The as-obtained full battery exhibits good cycling stability and rate capability. It was able to deliver a capacity of 32 mA h g-1 at 20 C, 76 % of the capacity at 2 C. After 200 cycles at 2 C, 97 % of the initial capacity was maintained for this battery, which suggests good cycling stability.",

        "abstract": "Here we demonstrate the broad capability to exploit interactions at different length scales in 2D materials to prepare macroscopic functional materials containing hybrid black phosphorus/graphene (BP/G) heterostructured building blocks. First, heterostructured 2D building blocks are self-assembled during co-exfoliation in the solution phase based on electrostatic attraction of different 2D materials. Second, electrophoretic deposition is used as a tool to assemble these building blocks into macroscopic films containing these self-assembled 2D heterostructures. Characterization of deposits formed using this technique elucidates the presence of stacked and sandwiched 2D heterostructures, and zeta potential measurements confirm the mechanistic interactions driving this assembly. Building on the exceptional sodium alloying capacity of BP, these materials were demonstrated as superior binder-free and additive-free anodes for sodium batteries with specific discharge capacity of 2365 mA h gP-1 and long stable cycling duration. This study demonstrates how controllable co-processing of 2D materials can enable material control for stacking and building block assembly relevant to broad future applications of 2D materials.",

        "abstract": "CoFe2O4-coated polypyrrole (PPy) nanotubes (CFO-PPy-NTs) with three-dimensional (3-D) interconnected networks have been prepared through a simple hydrothermal method. The application has been also studied for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). The finely crystallized CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (around 5 nm in size) are uniformly grown on the PPy nanotubes. When tested as anode materials for SIBs, the CFO-PPy-NT electrode maintains a discharge capacity of 400 mA h g-1 and a stable Coulombic efficiency of 98% after 200 cycles at 100 mA g-1. Even at a higher current density of 1000 mA g-1, the composite can still retain a discharge capacity of 220 mA h g-1 after 2000 cycles. The superior electrochemical performance could be mainly ascribed to the uniform distribution of CoFe2O4 on the 3-D matrix of PPy interconnected nanotubes, which favors the diffusion of sodium ions and electronic transportation and also buffers the large volumetric expansion during charge/discharge. Thereby our study suggests that such CFO-PPy-NTs have great potential as an anode material for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have attracted considerable attention in recent years. In order to promote the practical application of sodium-ion batteries, the electrochemical performances, such as specific capacity, reversibility, and rate capability of the anode materials, should be further improved. In this work, a Fe2O3/C composite with a well-ordered mesoporous structure is prepared via a facile co-impregnation method by using mesoporous silica SBA-15 as a hard template. When used as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries, the well-ordered mesoporous structure ensures fast mass transport kinetics. The presence of nano-sized Fe2O3 particles confined within the carbon walls significantly enhances the specific capacity of the composite. The carbon walls in the composite act not only as an active material contributing to the specific capacity, but also as a conductive matrix improving the cycling stability of Fe2O3 nanoparticles. As a result, the well-ordered mesoporous Fe2O3/C composite exhibits high specific capacity, excellent cycleability, and high rate capability. It is proposed that this simple co-impregnation method is applicable for the preparation of well-ordered mesoporous transition oxide/carbon composite electrode materials for high performance sodium-ion and lithium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) has been regarded as a favorable cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high voltage and stable structure. However, the limited electronic conductivity restricts its rate performance. NVPF@reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was synthesized by a facile microwave-assisted hydrothermal approach with subsequent calcination to shorten the hydrothermal time. NVPF nanocuboids with sizes of 50-150 nm distributed on rGO can be obtained, delivering excellent electrochemical performance such as a longevity life (a high capacity retention of 85.6% after 7000 cycles at 10 C) and distinguished rate capability (116 mAh g-1 at 50 C with a short discharging/charging time of 1.2 min). The full battery with a Cu2Se anode represents a capacity of 116 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1. The introduction of rGO can augment the electronic conductivity and advance the Na+ diffusion speed, boosting the cycling and rate capability. Besides, the small lattice change (3.3%) and high structural reversibility during the phase transition process between Na3V2(PO4)2F3 and NaV2(PO4)2F3 testified by in situ X-ray diffraction are also advantageous for Na storage behavior. This work furnishes a simple method to synthesize polyanionic cathodes with ultrahigh rate and ultralong lifespan for fast-charging SIBs.",

On account of the high reduction activity of sodium metal with organic solvents, it is very important to optimize the electrolyte component to realize high stability on Na metal and hard carbon anodes. Herein, chemical and electrochemical stability of propylene carbonate (PC)-based electrolytes on sodium metal and hard carbon anodes is investigated systematically. The results demonstrate that whether using NaClO4 or NaPF6, the PC-based electrolytes are not stable on Na metal, but adding of FEC can immensely enhance the stability of the electrolyte because of the compact solid electrolyte interphase film formed. The electrolytes containing FEC also exhibit high electrochemical compatibility on hard carbon anodes, showing high reversible capacity and excellent cycling performance. A reaction mechanism based on the Na+ induction effect is proposed by spectrum and electrochemical measurements. This study can provide a new insight to optimize and develop stable PC-based electrolytes and be helpful for understanding the other electrolyte systems.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries, but the performance remains unsatisfactory and the sodiation mechanism in HC is one of the most debated topics. Here, from self-assembled cellulose nanocrystal sheets with crystallographic texture, unique HC nanosheets with vertically oriented (002) planes are fabricated and used as a model HC to investigate the sodiation mechanisms using synchrotron scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) coupled with analytical transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The model HC simplifies the 3D sodiation in a typical HC particle into a 2D sodiation, which facilitates the visualization of phase transformation at different states of charge. The results for the first time unveil that the sodiation in HC initiates heterogeneously, with multiple propagation fronts proceeding simultaneously, eventually merging into larger aggregates. The spatial correlation between the preferential adsorption and nucleation sites suggests that the heterogeneous nucleation is driven by the local Na-ion concentration, which is determined by defects or heteroatoms that have strong binding to Na ions. By identifying intercalation as the dominant sodium storage mechanism in the model HC, the findings highlight the importance of engineering the graphene layer orientation and the structural heterogeneity of edge sites to enhance the performances.",

However, the compact multilayer structure and deficient delamination significantly inhibits their application, requiring high energy and showing decreased storage capacity and poor rate capabilities. Few-layer MXene has been proved to benefit superior electrochemical properties with a better ionic conductivity and two-dimensional layer structure. Herein, we report scale delamination of few-layer MXene nanosheets as anodes for sodium-ion batteries, which are prepared via an organic solvent assist high-energy mechanical-milling method. This approach efficiently prevents the oxidation of MXene and produces few-layer nanosheets structure, facilitating fast electron transport and Na+ diffusion. Electrochemical tests demonstrate that the few-layer MXenes show high specific capacity, excellent cycle stability, and good rate performance. Specifically, few-layer MXene nanosheets deliver a high reversible capacity of 267 mA h g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1. After cycling 1500 cycles at a high rate of 1 A g-1, a reversible capacity of 76 mA h g-1 could be maintained.",

        "abstract": "The large volume expansion of a silicon anode induces serious mechanical failure and limits its applications. Owing to the intrinsic weak van der Waals force and poor toughness, it is unable to solve this issue with the current commercial poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) binder. The development of a binder with strong binding strength with silicon (Si) is urgent. Herein, a hydroxyl-rich three-dimensional (3D) network binder is synthesized by chemical cross-linking reactions between epichlorohydrin (ECH) and sodium hyaluronate (SH), which exhibits dramatically enhanced toughness and cohesive properties. The Si anode with the novel SH-ECH as the binder delivers excellent electrochemical performance, especially cycling stability. The discharge capacity could maintain 800.4 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at a current of 0.2 C with the average capacity decay rate per cycle of 0.015%. Our results pave a new way for the tailoring of the chemical structures of natural polymers to realize lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with superior electrochemical performance.",

        "abstract": "Developing the three-dimensional self-assembled nanoarchitecture with well-defined crystal structure is an effective strategy to enhance the electrochemical performances of electrode materials. Herein, (110)-oriented and bridged nanoblocks self-assembled VS4 microspheres are controllably synthesized by a facile one-step hydrothermal method. (110)-bridged structure sets up open pathways for Na+ diffusion among nanoblocks, and (110)-oriented structure provides unobstructed pathways for Na+ diffusion in nanoblocks, which collectively construct the multi-dimensional Na+ transfer channels in the VS4 microspheres, and then promote the electrochemical kinetics. This material, as an anode of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), exhibits pseudocapacitive Na+ storage process and excellent rate capability, delivering a high capacity of 339 and 270 mAhg-1 at a rate of 0.1 and 2.0 Ag-1 with a capacity retention of 79% in the voltage window of 0.5 ~ 3.0 V. Particularly, the reversible capacity reaches up to 575 mAhg-1 after 300 cycles even at 1.0 Ag-1 in the voltage window of 0.05 ~ 3.0 V, outperforming those of the ever-reported VS4-based anode materials.

        "abstract": "Sodiophilic micro‐composite films of sodium‐chalcogenide intermetallics (Na2Te and Na2S) and Cu particles are fabricated onto commercial copper foam current collectors (Na2Te@CF and Na2S@CF). For the first time a controllable capacity thermal infusion process is demonstrated. Enhanced wetting by the metal electrodeposition leads to state‐of‐the‐art electrochemical performance. For example, Na2Te@CF‐based half‐cells demonstrate stable cycling at 6 mA cm−2 and 6 mAh cm−2, corresponding to 54 µm of Na electrodeposited/electrodissolved by geometric area. Sodium metal batteries with Na3V2 (PO4)3 cathodes are stable at 30C (7 mA cm−2) and for 10 000 cycles at 5C and 10C. Cross‐sectional cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo‐FIB) microscopy details deposited and remnant dissolved microstructures. Sodium metal electrodeposition onto Na2Te@CF is dense, smooth, and free of dendrites or pores. On unmodified copper foam, sodium grows in a filament‐like manner, not requiring cycling to achieve this geometry. Substrate–metal interaction critically affects the metal–electrolyte interface, namely the thickness and morphology of the solid electrolyte interphase. Density functional theory and mesoscale simulations provide insight into support‐adatom energetics, nucleation response, and early‐stage morphological evolution. On Na2Te sodium atomic dispersion is thermodynamically more stable than isolated clusters, leading to conformal adatom coverage of the surface.",

        "abstract": "Practical implementation of alkali metal batteries currently still faces formidable challenges because of the dendrite growth upon continuous charge/discharge processes and the associated unstable solid–electrolyte interphase. Herein, it is reported that dendrites can be fundamentally mitigated in lithium and sodium metal batteries by regulating the Li+ and Na+ flux using a glass fiber (GF) separator impregnated with polytetrafluoroethylene nanospheres (PTFE‐NSs), which results in homogeneous deposition of Li and Na during charging. The COMSOL Multiphysics simulations reveal that the introduction of negatively charged PTFE‐NSs into the GF separator enhances the local electric field near the anode, thereby boosting the transfer of cations. It is demonstrated that Li//Li and Na//Na symmetric cells utilising a PTFE‐GF separator show outstanding cycle stability of 1245 and 2750 h, respectively, at 0.5 mA cm−2. Moreover, the Li//LiFePO4 and Na//Na3V2(PO4)2F3 full cells exhibit remarkably improved capacity retention when cycled at 1 C, in the presence of a PTFE‐GF separator. The nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies suggest that the impregnation of PTFE‐NSs into GF helps “liberate” more Li+ and Na+ and changes the coordination interaction between ions and solvents, contributing to the enhanced electrochemical performance.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are recognized as promising energy storage devices. However, they suffer from rapid capacity decay at ultra-low temperatures due to high Na+ desolvation energy barrier and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, a weakly solvating electrolyte (WSE) with decreased ion-dipole interactions is designed for stable sodium storage in hard carbon (HC) anode at ultra-low temperatures. 2-methyltetrahydrofuran with low solvating power is incorporated into tetrahydrofuran to regulate the interactions between Na+ and solvents. The reduced Na+-dipole interactions facilitate more anionic coordination in the first solvation sheath, which consistently maintains anion-enhanced solvation structures from room to low temperatures to promote inorganic-rich SEI formation. These enable WSE with a low freezing point of -83.3°C and faster Na+ desolvation kinetics. The HC anode thus affords reversible capacities of 243.2 and 205.4 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 at -40 and -60°C, respectively, and the full cell of HC||Na3V2(PO4)3 yields an extended lifespan over 250 cycles with high capacity retention of ~100% at -40°C.

The co-existence of two alkali metals in an anode raises a question: whether the liquid Na-K alloy acts as a Na or a K anode. Here we show the alkali-metal that is stripped from the liquid Na-K anode is dependent on the preference of the cathode host. It acts as the anode of a sodium rechargeable cell if the cathode host structure selectively accepts only Na+ ions; as the anode of a potassium rechargeable cell if the cathode accepts K+ ions in preference to Na+ ions.

Designing a 3D confinement scaffold is a promising strategy for constructing dendrite‐free sodium‐metal anodes; however, cycling stability at a large current density (>10 mA cm−2) is still difficult to realize. Herein, the design of new lightweight and fibrous hydroxylated Ti3C2 (h‐Ti3C2) MXene based scaffolds with stepped sodiophilic gradient structure (h‐M‐SSG) is reported, and its thickness can be controlled (80−250 µm). The sodiophilic gradient structure (adjusted by h‐Ti3C2) can effectively induce sodium ions to preferentially deposit at the bottom of the scaffold, thus inhibiting dendrite growth. h‐M‐SSG/Na‐based symmetrical batteries exhibit a low polarization voltage and long cycling life at a high current density (40 mA cm−2) and a high cut‐off capacity (40 mAh cm−2). Moreover, a Na–O2 battery with an h‐M‐SSG/Na anode exhibits a low potential gap of 0.137 V after 45 cycles at 1000 mA g−1 and 1000 mAh g−1.

To address these issues, herein, SnO2 quantum dots (≈5 nm) embedded in porous N-doped carbon matrix (SnO2 /NC) are developed via a hydrothermal step combined with a self-polymerization process at room temperature. The ultrasmall size in quantum dots can greatly shorten the ion diffusion distance and lower the internal strain, improving the conversion reaction efficiency and coulombic efficiency. The rich mesopores/micropores and highly conductive N-doped carbon matrix can further enhance the overall conductivity and buffer effect of the composite. As a result, the optimized SnO2 /NC-2 composite for LIBs exhibits a high coulombic efficiency of 72.9%, a high discharge capacity of 1255.2 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles and a long life-span with a capacity of 753 mAh g-1 after 1500 cycles at 1 A g-1 .

        "abstract": "Composite cathodes have attracted great attentions due to the integrated advantages of each pure structure. And the component ratio deserves a carefully modulation to further improve the corresponding electrochemical performance. Mn-based layer-tunnel hybrid composite became a focus in sodium ion batteries due to the supe-riority in high performance, low cost and non-toxicity. In the previous reports, the structure modulation was car-ried out via changing the synthesis condition, varying the transition metal element ratio, and different ion doping. And it is still challenging to explore a more feasible method to simplify the adjustment process. Herein, we intro-duced Mg2+ into Na sites or transition metal sites in Na0.6MnO2 and firstly discovered the doping-sites variation induced structure adjustment phenomenon. Specifically, Mg doping in transition metal sites could be beneficial for the growth of the P2-type structure while layer/tunnel component ratio decreased when locating Mg2+ in Na sites. The P2-O2 phase transformations could be effectively suppressed by locating Mg2+ in both sites could the in high voltage regions and thus improve cycling performance. The designed material, Na0.6Mn0.99Mg0.01O2, could attain a decent capacity of 100 mA h g-1 at 1000 mA g-1 and a satisfied retention of 76.6 % after 500 cycles. Ad-ditionally, ex situ XRD experiments verify the excellent structural stability of Mg-substituted samples during charge-discharge processes. Moreover, the Na0.6Mn0.99Mg0.01O2 also displays superior sodium-ion full-cell proper-ties when merged with hard carbon anode. Thus, this research may indicate a proper novel thread for designing high-performance composite electrodes.",

        "abstract": "Organic electrode materials with the advantages of renewability, environment-friendliness, low cost, and high capacity have received widespread attention in recent years for sodium-ion batteries. However, small molecular organic materials suffer from issues such as low conductivity and the high dissolution rate in electrolytes. Herein, a phthalocyanine derivative (TPcDS) with a large non-localized π-electron system, obtained through thermodynamic polymerization of 4-aminophthalonitrile (AP) monomers, is designed to address these issues. According to the density function theory calculation, six sodium ions can be attracted by one polymer molecule, indicating a high theoretical capacity of 375 mA h g-1 . The TPcDS molecule realizes sodium storage through a non-localized π-electron system of phthalocyanine macrocycles. When employed as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries, the functional groups of phthalocyanine macrocycles, such as CN groups in TPcDS, experience obviously reversible structural variation upon discharge/charge. A high reversible capacity of 364 mAh g-1 is achieved at a current density of 0.05 A g-1 , and a charge capacity of as high as 246 mAh g-1 is still maintained after 500 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 .

        "abstract": "Highly crystalline CuFeS2 containing earth-abundant and environmentally friendly elements prepared via a high-temperature synthesis exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance as an anode material in sodium-ion batteries. The initial specific capacity of 460 mAh g-1 increases to 512 mAh g-1 in the 150th cycle and then decreases to a still very high value of 444 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 in the remaining 550 cycles. Even for a large current density, a pronounced cycling stability is observed. Here, we demonstrate that combining the results of X-ray powder diffraction experiments, pair distribution function analysis, and 23Na NMR and Mössbauer spectroscopy investigations performed at different stages of discharging and charging processes allows elucidation of very complex reaction mechanisms. In the first step after uptake of 1 Na/CuFeS2, nanocrystalline NaCuFeS2 is formed as an intermediate phase, which surprisingly could be recovered during charging. On increasing the Na content, Cu+ is reduced to nanocrystalline Cu, while nanocrystalline Na2S and nanosized elemental Fe are formed in the discharged state. After charging, the main crystalline phase is NaCuFeS2. At the 150th cycle, the mechanisms clearly changed, and in the charged state, nanocrystalline CuxS phases are observed. At later stages of cycling, the mechanisms are altered again: NaF, Cu2S, and Cu7.2S4 appeared in the discharged state, while NaF and Cu5FeS4 are observed in the charged state. In contrast to a typical conversion reaction, nanocrystalline phases play the dominant role, which are responsible for the high reversible capacity and long-term stability.",

        "abstract": "Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) hold immense promise for large-scale energy storage, but their practical application is hindered by zinc anode limitations. We introduce diethylenetriamine pentaacetate sodium salt (DTPA-Na) as a novel electrolyte additive to address these challenges. DTPA-Na's unique dual functionality enables the formation of robust, multi-layered solid electrolyte interphases (SEI) on the zinc anode and stable cathode electrolyte interphases (CEI) on the MnOOH cathode. This synergistic SEI/CEI engineering approach effectively suppresses interfacial side reactions, promotes uniform zinc deposition, and inhibits dendrite growth, leading to exceptional cycling stability and self-discharge inhibition. Asymmetrical cells employing DTPA-Na achieve an unprecedented 32,000 cycles at a high charging rate of 50 mA/cm2, while symmetric cells demonstrate a lifespan of 160 hours with 95% zinc utilization. Full Zn||MnOOH cells exhibit remarkable stability, maintaining 98.61% capacity retention after 720 hours of self-discharge and negligible capacity decay over 5000 cycles.

        "abstract": "To achieve high‐quality hard carbon nanofibers (HCNFs), and particularly flexible HCNFs films is the eternal pursuit from low‐cost coal pitch (CP). However, it is still trapped seriously by the inborn bottleneck of low‐softening‐point (LSP) characteristics of CP itself. Herein, an efficient Bi(NO3)3·5H2O‐assisted electrospinning‐carbonization methodology is creatively devised to obtain flexible HCNFs films directly from LSP CP. The essential roles of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and pre‐oxidation in constructing flexible films are rationally proposed. With further regulation in Bi(NO3)3·5H2O dosage and calcination temperatures, specific micro‐structures/morphologies of flexible HCNFs films are finely optimized. The optimum HCNFs‐1.2 film is endowed with robust structural flexibility/stability, high‐content active oxygen/nitrogen groups, abundant graphic microcrystalline zones of large interlayer spacing, and convenient ion‐diffusion channels. Thanks to such remarkable merits, HCNFs‐1.2 retains a large reversible capacity of 125.3 mAh g‒1 over 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g‒1, when evaluated as a self‐supporting film anode for sodium dual‐ion batteries (SDIBs). Furthermore, the HCNFs‐1.2‐based SDIBs deliver a specific capacity of 90.9 mAh g‒1 at 0.1 A g‒1, along with a capacity retention of 78.4% after 1500 cycles at 1.0 A g‒1. The insightful understanding here will provide meaningful guidance for rational design of advanced flexible film electrodes toward next‐generation SDIBs and beyond.",

However, the low initial Coulombic efficiency of traditional SIBs severely impedes their further development. Here, a highly active Na2 S-based composite is employed as a self-sacrificial additive for sodium compensation in SIBs. The in situ synthesized Na2 S is wrapped in a carbon matrix with nanoscale particle size and good electrical conductivity, which helps it to achieve a significantly enhanced electrochemical activity as compare to commercial Na2 S. As a highly efficient presodiation additive, the proposed Na2 S/C composite can reach an initial charge capacity of 407 mAh g-1 . When 10 wt.% Na2 S/C additive is dispersed in the Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 cathode, and combined with a hard carbon anode, the full cell achieves 24.3% higher first discharge capacity, which corresponds to a 18.3% increase in the energy density from 117.2 to 138.6 Wh kg-1 . Meanwhile, it is found that the Na2 S additive does not generate additional gas during the initial charging process, and under an appropriate content, its reaction product has no adverse impact on the cycling stability and rate performance of SIBs. Overall, this work establishes Na2 S as a highly effective additive for the construction of advanced high-energy-density SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, the extended usage of lithium/sodium ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs) encounters nerve-wracking issues, including a lack of suitable reservoirs and high thermal runaway hazards. Although using TiO2 and Li4Ti5O12 has been confirmed to be effective in improving battery safety, their low theoretical capacities inevitably cause damage to the electrochemical performance of the battery. Achieving win-win results has become an urgent necessity. This study designed a metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived in situ carbon-coated metal selenide (Ni-Se@G@C) as the anode. When the current density is 0.1-0.3 A g-1, the initial capacity of LIBs reaches 993.2 mAh g-1, which increases to 1478.9 mAh g-1 after running 800 cycles. When running at 2 A g-1, the cell also offers a relatively high capacity of 458.3 mAh g-1 after 1500 cycles. After the replacement of graphite with Ni-Se@G@C, the self-heating temperature (T0) and thermal runaway triggering temperature (T1) of half and full cells are significantly increased. Meanwhile, the maximum thermal runaway temperature (T2) and maximal heating release rate (HRRmax) are significantly reduced. Of note, the usage of Ni-Se@G@C enables the battery with superior cycling and rate performance. When used in SIBs, the cell gives an initial discharge capacity of 624.9 mAh g-1, which still remains at 269.4 mAh g-1 after running 200 cycles at 1 A g-1. Notably, Ea of the Ni-Se@G@C cell is 5.6 times higher than that of the graphite cell, corroborating the promoted safety performance. This work provides a new paradigm for MOF-derived micro/nanostructures, enabling the battery with an excellent electrochemical and safety performance portfolio.",

Herein, Na3.5V1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 (NVFP) is designed by an Fe‐substitution strategy, which not only reduces the exorbitant cost of vanadium, but also realizes high‐voltage multielectron reactions. The NVFP cathode can deliver extraordinary capacity (148.2 mAh g−1), and decent cycling durability up to 84% after 10 000 cycles at 100 C. In situ X‐ray diffraction and ex situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations reveal reversible structural evolution and redox processes (Fe2+/Fe3+, V3+/V4+, and V4+/V5+) during electrochemical reactions. The low ionic‐migration energy barrier and ideal Na+‐diffusion kinetics are elucidated by density functional theory calculations. Combined with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fe with unpaired electrons in the 3d orbital is inseparable from the higher‐valence redox activation. More competitively, coupling with a hard carbon (HC) anode, HC//NVFP full cells demonstrate high‐rate capability and long‐duration cycling lifespan (3000 stable cycles at 50 C), along with material‐level energy density up to 304 Wh kg−1.

However, MoSe2 remains suffering from inferior stability as well as unsatisfactory rate capability because of the unavoidable volume expansion and sluggish charge transport during lithiation-delithiation cycles. Herein, we develop a simultaneous reduction-intercalation strategy to synthesize expanded MoSe2 (e-MoSe2) with an interlayer spacing of 0.98 nm and a rich 1T phase (53.7%) by rationally selecting the safe precursors of ethylenediamine (NH2C2H4NH2), selenium dioxide (SeO2), and sodium molybdate (Na2MoO4). It is noteworthy that NH2C2H4NH2 can effectively reduce SeO2 and MoO42- forming MoSe2 nanosheets; in the meantime, the generated ammonium (NH4+) efficiently intercalates between MoSe2 layers, leading to charge transfer, thus stabilizing 1T phases. The obtained e-MoSe2 exhibits high capacities of 778.99 and 611.40 mAh g-1 at 0.2 and 1 C, respectively, together with excellent cycling stability (retaining >90% initial capacity at 0.2 C over 100 charge-discharge cycles).

Here, we demonstrate ball-milled TiNb2O7 (BM-TNO) as an SIB anode, which provides an average voltage of ∼0.6 V and a reversible capacity of ∼180 mAh g-1 at a current density of 15 mA g-1, and presents excellent cyclability with 95% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 500 mA g-1. A possible Na storage mechanism in BM-TNO is also proposed.",

        "abstract": "MoS2 is the most promising anode material for secondary battery with its unique 2D layered structure. However, the application of MoS2 is restricted by the poor electrical conductivity and sluggish ion diffusion. Herein, hollow nanotubes constructed with highly conductive 1T phase MoS2 nanosheets and polypyrrole (PPy) nanotubes are fabricated and used as anode materials for lithium‐ion batteries and sodium‐ion batteries. Remarkably, these hollow nanotubes show a high lithium‐specific capacity of 755.5 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and excellent sodium‐specific capacity of 503.3 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles. The enhanced electrochemical performance can be attributed to the rational design of unique 1D and 2D composite structure. First, the highly conductive 1T phase MoS2 2D nanosheets and hollow 1D PPy nanotube can effectively promote the charge transfer kinetics. However, the increased interlayer spacing of 1T phase MoS2 rapidly improves the insertion/extraction process of metal ions, and the vertical growth of MoS2 nanosheets on the surface of the PPy nanotubes also exposes more energy storage sites. This work provides a new idea for the preparation of MoS2‐based composite materials, and also proposes a reference for its application in the secondary battery.",

        "abstract": "Separators, necessary components to isolate cathodes and anodes in Li/Na-ion batteries, are consumed in large amounts per year; thus, their sustainability is a concerning issue for renewable energy storage systems. However, the eco-efficient and environmentally friendly fabrication of separators with a high mechanical strength, excellent thermal stability, and good electrolyte wettability is still challenging. Herein, we reported the fabrication of a new type of separators for Li/Na-ion batteries through the self-assembly of eco-friendly chitin nanofibers derived from prawn shells. We demonstrated that the pore size in the chitin nanofiber membrane (CNM) separator can be tuned by adjusting the amount of pore generation agent (sodium dihydrogen citrate) in the self-assembly process of chitin nanofibers. By optimizing the pore size in CNM separators, the electrochemical performance of the LiFePO4/Li half-cell with a CNM separator is comparable to that with a commercialized polypropylene (PP) separator. More attractively, the CNM separator showed a much better performance in the LiFePO4/Li cell at 120 °C and Na3V2(PO4)3/Na cell than the PP separator. The proposed fabrication of separators by using natural raw materials will play a significant contribution to the sustainable development of renewable energy storage systems.",

The reflux-synthesized hybrid shows a well-overlapped 2D structure, while the solvothermally prepared hybrid forms a segregated phase in which the contact area between the CONs and GNs is reduced. These two hybrids synthesized by facile methods are fully characterized, and the results reveal that their energy-storage properties can be significantly improved by enhancing the electrical conductivity via the formation of a well-overlapped structure between CONs and GNs. The discharge capacity and rate capability of the reflux-synthesized hybrid was considerably larger than that of the bare CONs, highlighting that the improvement in the charge-carrier transport properties can improve the accessibility of Na ions to the surface of the hybrids. This synthetic methodology can be extended to the fabrication of high-performance anodes for Na-ion batteries.",

Although the same yolk-shell nanostructure (primary particle size, porosity) and three-dimensional architecture alleviated the volume change induced stress and swelling in both batteries, the SIBs show 99% capacity retention over 200 cycles, much better than the 78% capacity retention of the LIBs.

        "abstract": "Iron sulfides with high theoretical capacity confront the challenges of low rate capability and severe capacity fading for sodium storage, which are mainly caused by poor electron/ion transport kinetics and drastic volume fluctuations during cycling. Herein, to mitigate these obstacles, a multi-step synthetic tactic involving solvothermal, carbonization, and subsequent sulfurization is put forward for the construction of wire-like structure by confining Fe7S8 particles in porous N-doped carbon framework (denoted as Fe7S8/PNC) using zinc iron nitrilotriacetate as template. By partially substituting Fe3+ with Zn2+ in the metal coordination complex, the porous structure of coordination complex derived carbon framework can be regulated through pore structure engineering of Zn nanodroplets. The desired porous and robust core/shell structure can not only afford favorable electron/Na+ transport paths and additional active sites for Na+ storage, but also provide reinforced structural integrity of interior Fe7S8 particles by retarding the pulverization and buffering the mechanical stress against volume fluctuations. As anode for sodium-ion batteries, the optimal Fe7S8/PNC delivers a high reversible capacity (743 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), superior rate capability (553 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1), and long-term cycling stability (602 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 with 98.5% retention after 1000 cycles).",

In this study, a precursor of Co1-xS with a uniform and hollow nanospherical architecture is obtained with a high yield via a mild solvothermal method in the presence of 2-methylimidazole at first. Then, Co1-xS, Co1-xS/C (ultrafine Co1-xS nanoparticles embedded in the shells of the nitrogen-doped porous carbon hollow nanosphere), and Co1-xS@C (Co1-xS nanoparticles entirely covered by an external amorphous carbon layer) were selectively fabricated via direct calcination or PPy coating & calcination of the obtained precursor.

Besides the excellent rate performance, a high reversible discharge capacity of 320 mA g-1 can be retained after 130 cycles at 1 A g-1. The impressive performance may be attributed to the unique structure, higher conductivity, and more active sites of Co1-xS/C. In addition, 559 mA h g-1 was maintained after 100 cycles at 500 mA g-1 when the Co1-xS/C composite was applied as an anode in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).

Nevertheless, the electrochemical energy storage performance is still impaired by the tendency of aggregation, volume, and morphological change during the conversion reaction and poor intrinsic conductivity. Until now, ultrathin molybdenum disulfide nanosheets with a metallic-phase structure on the inner surface of mesoporous hollow carbon spheres (M-MoS2@HCS) have rarely been investigated as an anode for sodium-ion batteries. In this work, a novel M-MoS2@HCS anode was designed and synthesized by employing a template-assisted solvothermal reaction. Structural and chemical analyses indicate that the M-MoS2 nanosheets with a larger interlayer spacing compared to their semiconductor counterpart grow on the inner surface of HCS via covalent interactions. When used as the anode materials for Na+ storage, the M-MoS2@HCS anode presents durable and rapid sodium storage properties. The developed electrode shows a reversible capacity of 291.2 mAh g-1 at a high current density of 5 A g-1. After 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1, the reversible capacity is 401.3 mAh g-1 with a capacity retention rate of 79%. After 2500 cycles at 1.0 A g-1, the electrode still delivers a reversible capacity of 320.1 mAh g-1 with a capacity retention rate of 75%. The excellent sodium storage capability of the MoS2@HCS electrode is explained by the special structural design, which reveals great potential to accelerate the practical applications of transition-metal dichalcogenide electrodes for sodium storage.",

With the addition of an appropriate amount of GO content, the compressive Young's modulus of 2 wt% GO+PVDF-HFP (2-GPH) composite GPE is greatly enhanced by a factor of 10, reaching 2.5 GPa, which is crucial in the suppression of sodium dendrite growth. As a result, uniform sodium deposition and ultralong reversible sodium plating/stripping (over 400 h) at high current density (5 mA cm-2 ) are achieved. Furthermore, as evidenced by molecular dynamics simulation, the GO content facilitates the sodium ion transportation, giving a high ionic conductivity of 2.3 × 10-3 S cm-1 . When coupled with Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 cathode in a full sodium metal battery, a high initial capacity of 107 mA h g-1 at 1 C (1 C = 117 mA g-1 ) is recorded, with an excellent capacity retention rate of 93.5% and high coulombic efficiency of 99.8% after 1100 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Heteroatom‐doped porous carbons have stable structures, high electron/ion transport efficiencies, and rich electroactive sites, which are of great significance to energy storage devices. The potential synergistic effects arising from the multi‐element doping benefit to improve the electrochemical behavior of porous carbon. In this paper, a facile doping strategy has been proposed to prepare the (N, Co, Zr, P) tetra‐doped porous carbon spheres (PCS) for enhanced lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs). The metal‐organophosphine framework (MOPF) as precursor is synthesized by utilizing riboflavin sodium phosphate as organic ligand coordinating with cobalt and zirconium ions. Through carbonizing MOPF, the (N, Co, Zr, P) tetra‐doped PCS can be obtained. As the anode for LIBs, the (N, Co, Zr, P) tetra‐doped PCS exhibits highly reversible capacity of 761 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles, excellent rate performance of 126 mAh g−1 even at a high current density of 2 A g−1. The results feature that the unique 3D structure and superior local electron transport properties of (N, Co, Zr, P) tetra‐doped PCS promote the Li+ diffusion and adsorption, which improve the electrochemical properties. Moreover, the mechanism analysis realizes that the Li+ storage of (N, Co, Zr, P) tetra‐doped PCS is determined by the capacitive behavior at high scan rate, highlighting the significance of the heteroatom doping. Therefore, the (N, Co, Zr, P) tetra‐doped PCS should be considered as prominent candidate for high‐performance LIBs anodes.",

Here, ether electrolytes with NaBF4 as the main salt or additive were applied in NFM//HC full cells and showed enhanced performance than the electrolyte with NaPF6. Then, BF4- was found to have a stronger interaction with Na+, which could reduce the solvation of Na+ with the solvent, thus inducing the formation of the cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) and solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layers rich in inorganic species. Moreover, the morphology, structure, composition, and solubility of CEI and SEI were explored, concluding that NaBF4 could induce more stable CEI and SEI layers rich in B-containing species and inorganics.

        "abstract": "Intimately coupled carbon/transition‐metal‐based hierarchical nanostructures are one of most interesting electrode materials for boosting energy conversion and storage applications owing to the strong synergistic effect between the two components and appealing structural stability. Herein, a universal method is reported for making hierarchical hollow carbon nanospheres (HCSs) with intimately coupled ultrathin carbon nanosheets and Mo‐based nanocrystals. The in situ and confined reaction of the synthetic strategy can not only allow the aggregation of the nanocrystals to be impeded, but also endows extremely intimate coupled interaction between the conductive carbon nanosheets and the nanocrystals MoM (M = P, S, C and O). As a proof of concept, the as‐prepared MoP/C HCSs exhibit extraordinary hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalytic activity with small overpotential and robust durability in both acidic and alkaline solutions. In addition, the unique sheet‐on‐sheet MoS2/C HCSs as an anode demonstrate high capacity, great rate capabilities, and long‐term cycles for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). The capacity can be maintained at 410 mA h g−1 even after 1000 cycles even at a high current density of 4 A g−1, one of the best reported values for MoS2‐based electrode materials for SIBs. The present work highlights the importance of designing and fabricating functional strongly coupled hybrid materials for enhancing energy conversion and storage applications.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) is most likely to be a commercialized anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, its low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) impedes its further large-scale industrialization. Since the ICE is greatly related to the side reactions of the electrolyte on the HC surface, herein, we focus on tailoring the surface chemistry of HC via a facile low-temperature oxygen plasma (LTOP) treatment technique. The modified HC after a suitable treatment time possesses a highly ordered and low defect surface without a negligible change in layer spacing, thus facilitating Na+ deinsertion/insertion and reducing the HC/electrolyte side reactions. Moreover, LTOP treatment also brings oxygen functional groups (CO) to the HC surface to enrich Na+ storage active sites. Consequently, the modified HC reveals a higher ICE of 80.9% compared to 60.6% in the bare HC. Also, the modified HC delivers an ultrahigh specific capacity of 331.0 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and exhibits superior rate performance with a high specific capacity of 211.0 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1. This work provides a feasible strategy to tailor the surface chemistry of HC for high-efficiency Na-storage and provides a novel avenue to construct high-efficiency SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have emerged as a promising alternative to Li-ion batteries due to the abundance of sodium. However, anodes in Na-ion batteries face challenges such as dendrite formation and an unstable solid electrolyte interface layer. To address these challenges, NaK liquid metal alloy anodes have been proposed as an alternative because they do not form dendrites. In our study, we demonstrate that the NaK alloy anode interacts with the commonly used ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate electrolyte, leading to a continuously growing unstable SEI layer, evidenced by cycling failures under 100 cycles and an increasing charge transfer resistance in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies. In situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that over the course of cycling the surface of the NaK anode becomes increasingly sodium-rich. After 30 cycles, XPS analysis detects only trace amounts of potassium on the NaK anode surface. When the electrolyte is analyzed postcycling using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, there is a noticeable increase in potassium levels, suggesting that potassium metal dissolves into the electrolyte. The introduction of a 10 wt % fluoroethylene carbonate additive can mitigate this problem to some extent, enabling an enhanced cycling performance of up to 800 cycles at 1C. Nevertheless, the dissolution of K metal is still evident in the XPS results, albeit to a lesser degree. These discoveries provide valuable insights for designing a more robust SEI layer for the NaK anode.",

A sodium-ion full cell assembled with SnS QDs@NC anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode exhibited high capacity and good cycling stability. Such a superior electrochemical performance of SnS QDs@NC can be attributed to the synergistic effects of NC and SnS QDs, where NC serves as a conducting matrix to support SnS QDs and helps avoid structural degradation.

Here, we present the synthesis, characterization, and application of lignin-derived ordered mesoporous carbons with various pore sizes (from 5 to approximately 50 nm) as anodes in sodium-ion batteries. We have varied the pore size using self-synthesized PEOn-b-PHAm block copolymers with different PEO and PHA chain lengths, applying the “soft templating” approach to introduce isolated spherical pores of 20 to 50 nm in diameters. The pore structure was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nitrogen physisorption, and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). We report the microstructure analysis of such mesoporous lignin-based carbons using Raman spectroscopy and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). In comparison with nontemplated carbon and carbons templated employing commercial Pluronic F-127 and PIB50-b-PEO45, which created accessible channels and spherical pores up to approximately 10 nm in diameter, the carbon microstructure analysis revealed that templating with all applied polymers significantly impedes graphitization upon thermal treatment. Furthermore, the gained knowledge of similar carbon microstructures regardless of the type of template allowed the investigation of the influence of different pore morphologies in carbon applied as an anode material in sodium-ion batteries, supporting the previous theories in the literature that closed pores are beneficial for sodium storage while providing insights into the importance of pore size.",

To this end, the electronic properties, adsorption energy, diffusion energy barrier, open‐circuit voltage (OCV), and theoretical capacity are evaluated. The density of states calculations indicate that BPNT and BBPNT with zero band gap have a metallic character, which is critical for electron transferring in electrode materials. The calculation of adsorption energies suggests that the inside of the tube has better adsorption than the outside. Also, doping with boron improves the adsorption inside and outside the nanotube. Sodium ion sees three ways to penetrate from the outside to the inside of the tube. Calculations illustrate that the bigger ring with eight atoms with a 7.08 eV energy barrier, compared to the other cavities, is more appropriate for diffusion. This energy decreases to 5.84 eV after boron doping. The OCV profile of BBPNT confirms that this structure is in the acceptable voltage range for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Finally, this work obtains a theoretical capacity of 403.82 mAh g−1 (without sodium clustering) for BBPNT, which confirms the potential of this structure for use in SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Metal oxalate has become a most promising anode candidate material for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries. However, there exists the problem of capacity decrease due to the volume expansion of the active material during cycling. Herein, the rodlike CoC2O4·2H2O/rGO hybrid has been fabricated via a novel multi-step solvo/hydro-thermal strategy. The structure characteristic of microrod CoC2O4·2H2O wrapped using rGO sheet not only inhibits the volume variation of the hybrid electrode during the cycle, but also accelerates the transfer of electrons and ions amongst the 3D graphene network, thereby improving the electrochemical properties of CoC2O4·2H2O. The CoC2O4·2H2O/rGO electrode delivers specific capacity of 1011.5 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 200 cycles for lithium storage, and exhibits high capacity of 221.1 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 100 cycles for sodium storage. Moreover, the full cell CoC2O4·2H2O/rGO//LiCoO2 consisted of the CoC2O4·2H2O/rGO anode and LiCoO2 cathode maintains 138.1 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at 0.2 A g-1 and has superior long-cycle stability. In addition, in-situ Raman, in-situ and ex-situ X-ray diffraction techniques have provided a unique opportunity to fully understand the reaction mechanism of CoC2O4·2H2O/rGO. This work also supplies a new perspective and certain research basis for the application of metal oxalate materials in high performance lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are expected to be a promising commercial alternative to lithium-ion batteries for grid electricity storage due to their potential low cost in the near future. Up to the present, the anode material still remains a great challenge for the application of SIBs, especially at room temperature. Graphite has an obvious limitation to store larger radius sodium ions (Na+) in comparison with lithium ions (Li+), while the hard carbon with large interlayer distance can demonstrate a relatively high storage capability and durable cycle life. However, the disadvantages of low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) mainly caused by large surface area and high cost synthetic approach hinder its practical applications. Herein, a new coupled carbonization strategy is presented to prepare a cost-effective hard carbon material by pyrolyzing and carbonizing the mixture of abundant sucrose and phenolic resin. Benefiting from the specialized pyrolysis reaction process and optimized conditions as studied in detail, the hard carbon has an extremely low surface area of 1.54 m2 g-1 and high initial Coulombic efficiency of 87%, which have been rarely reported before and enhance the utilization efficiency of Na+ consumption within the cathode in the future. More importantly, the hard carbon, with a high interlayer distance 3.95 Å, can deliver a higher capacity of 319 mAh g-1 and maintain a finer capacity retention of 90% over 150 cycles. Besides, a full cell with the configuration of as-prepared hard carbon anode versus an air-stable O3-Na0.9[Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48]O2 cathode is further presented, and it has a high ICE of 80% and energy density of 256 Wh kganode-1 (vs hard carbon) with reliable cycle performance. The results demonstrate that our synthetic strategy is feasible and extendable, while the tunable carbon-based materials should have wider applications in addition to the attractive properties in Na-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Low utilization of active metallic sodium (Na) and uncontrollable growth of Na dendrites remain significant challenges for high-performance Na metal batteries, which are limited to inefficient Na-utilization (<1%) and shallow cycling conditions (0.25-1.0 mAh cm-2). In this work, a kind of Na metal anode with record-high utilization and long-term cycling stability is reported, using carbon substrate-supported nitrogen-anchored zinc (Zn) single atoms as current collector. Single Zn atom sites serve as a strong \"magnet\" for Na ions, which guide the metallic Na uniform nucleation and free from dendrite-induced short circuit. The nucleation overpotential of our strategy is essentially zero, where most of the reported modified substrates are greatly exceed 20 mV. Specifically, the Na anodes exhibit a high Na stripping/plating Coulombic efficiency with 99.8% over 350 cycles and a stable voltage response with small voltage hysteresis after cycling 1000 h. The full cell exhibits high Na-utilization up to 100% and superior long-term cycling stability for more than 1000 cycles with excellent capacity retention. In terms of both lifetime and Na-utilization, our strategy are significantly outperforms the reported state-of-the-art Na metal anodes. Moreover, this affords new insights into the controllable Na nucleation behavior and high Na utilization, and sheds a fresh light on atomic level design of electrode for Na metal anodes.",

Here we propose a method of polymer-blended bacterial cellulose (BC) matrix to tune the micro/mesopores of polymer-BC derived carbon under a mild carbonization temperature. The targeted pore structure and electrochemical performance are optimized by controlling the amount of methyl methacrylate monomers via free-radical polymerization, and carbonized temperature via pyrolysis treatment. The constructed carbon materials display a stable 3D fibrous network with a large specific area and abundant micro/mesopores formed during the pyrolysis of the polymer poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Taking advantage of the constructed pore structure, the optimized carbon anodes derived from BC/PMMA composites show an enhanced Na+ diffusion rate with a high capacity of 380.66 mA h g-1 at 0.03 A g-1. It is interesting that it possesses superior low-potential capacity, and retains 42% of the total capacity even at a high scan rate of 1 mV s-1.

        "abstract": "With a high theoretical capacity, the MnS anode, however, exhibits a rather complex sodium diffusion kinetics and poor mechanical stability that hinder its application in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). In this work, a simple, economical, and scalable strategy is developed to inherently coat nanoporous MnS with a 3D N, S co-doped thin carbon layer by using commercially available MnCO3 as precursors. Specifically, the strategy involves a two-step annealing process, which converts the MnCO3 microparticles into nanoporous Mn2O3 and MnS step by step. The 3D N, S codoped carbon layer is in situ formed during the second annealing process by first coating the nanoporous Mn2O3 with a polyaniline layer. Due to the inherent 3D carbon protection and the strong electronic interaction between N, S dopants and MnS, the N, S codoped carbon protected MnS obtained at 900 °C (NS-C@MnS-900) anode displays a high specific capacity of 845 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, which is higher than all reported MnS-based SIB anodes. It also shows an outstanding cyclability and rate performance, maintaining a stable capacity of ≈493 mAh g-1 after 1300 cycles at 10 A g-1, which is also the best according to knowledge. These exceptional electrochemical performances and the scalable/simple/low-cost synthesis make the NS-C@MnS-900 attractive for industry application.",

        "abstract": "The pseudo‐layered sulfide NiCr2S4 exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance as anode material in sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). The Na storage mechanism is investigated by synchrotron‐based X‐ray scattering and absorption techniques as well as by electrochemical measurements. A very high reversible capacity in the 500th cycle of 489 mAh g−1 is observed at 2.0 A g−1 in the potential window 3.0–0.1 V. Full discharge includes irreversible generation of Ni0 and Cr0 nanoparticles embedded in nanocrystalline Na2S yielding shortened diffusion lengths and predominantly surface‐controlled charge storage. During charge, Ni0 and Cr0 are oxidized, Na2S is consumed, and amorphous Ni and Cr sulfides are formed. Limiting the potential window to 3.0–0.3 V an unusual nickel extrusion sodium insertion mechanism occurs: Ni2+ is reduced to nanosized Ni0 domains, expelled from the host lattice, and is replaced by Na+ cations to form O3‐type like NaCrS2. Surprisingly, the discharge and charge processes comprise Na+ shuttling between highly crystalline NiCr2S4 and NaCrS2 enabling a superior long‐term stability for 3000 cycles. The results not only provide valuable insights for the electrochemistry of conversion materials but also extend the scope of layered electrode materials considering the reversible nickel extrusion sodium insertion reaction as new concept for SIBs.",

Recently, eminent researchers have criticised the implementation of e.g. low active material contents/electrode loadings, the use of research‐type battery cell constructions, or the lack of statistically relevant data, resulting in overstated data and thus giving misleading predictions of the key performance indicators of new battery technologies. Here, we report on the establishment of a reference system for the development of sodium‐ion batteries. Electrodes are fabricated under relevant conditions using 9.5 mg/cm² self‐synthesised Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode active material and 3.6 mg/cm² commercially available hard carbon anode active material. It is found that different types of battery cells are more or less suitable for half‐ and/ or full‐cell testing, resulting in ir/reproducible or underestimated active material capacities. Furthermore, the influence of electrode overhang, which is relevant for upscaling, is evaluated. The demonstrator cell (TRL 4‐5) has been further characterised providing measured data on the power/energy density and thermal behaviour during rate testing up to 15 C and projections are made for its practical limits.",

        "abstract": "The development of efficient anodes for sodium‐ion batteries requires a deep understanding of the electrochemical processes involved. Herein, X‐ray spectroscopy is used to study changes in the electronic structure of MoS2 nanosheets coupled with few‐layered graphene at early stages of battery life. Working electrode is combined with a sodium plate and a solution of NaClO4 in ethyl carbonate/dimethyl carbonate in a homemade cell having an X‐ray transparent window. X‐ray absorption spectra at the S K‐edge and Mo L3‐edge are recorded using a synchrotron source, X‐ray emission S Kα and Mo Lα spectra are obtained on a laboratory spectrometer for initial powder and electrode material at different potentials of the cell. Analysis of the spectra shows the occupation of the initially empty orbitals of MoS2 by sodium electrons as a result of the interaction of the components of the sodium‐ion half‐cell. Ex situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of a fully discharged electrode material reveal partial transformation of hexagonal MoS2 to disordered tetragonal MoS2 coated with a surface electrolyte interphase layer. The obtained results indicate that coupling MoS2 to graphene prevents the breaking of Mo–S bonds when Na+ ions are first introduced, which may promote stable battery performance.",

Herein, we present an atomic force microscopic method for an in situ analysis of a single Sn nanoparticle during sodiation and desodiation, which is conducted in an aprotic liquid electrolyte akin to a real electrochemical environment of the Na-ion cells. The morphological evolution of different-sized single Sn nanoparticle is visualized during the charge/discharge cycles by using a homemade planar electrode. All of the Sn nanoparticles exhibit a dramatic initial volume expansion of about 420% after sodiation to Na15Sn4. Interestingly, we find that the smaller Sn nanoparticles show a lower rate of irreversible volume change and a better shape maintenance than the larger ones after desodiation. This finding suggests the importance of downsizing in improving the mechanical stability and the cycling performance of the Sn-based anodes in sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been attracting great attention as the most promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for large-scale energy storage. However, the absence of suitable anode materials is the main bottleneck for the commercial application of SIBs. Herein, the adsorption and diffusion behaviors of Na on graphether are predicted by first-principles density functional calculations. Our results show that Na atoms can be adsorbed on graphether forming a uniform and stable coverage on both sides. Even at low intercalated Na concentrations, the semiconducting graphether can be changed to a metallic state, ensuring good electrical conductivity. Due to the structural anisotropy of graphether, the Na+ ions show a remarkable one-dimensional diffusion with an ultralow energy barrier of 0.04 eV, suggesting ultrafast charge/discharge characteristics. The graphether monolayer has a high theoretical specific capacity of 670 mA h g-1, which is much higher than commercial graphite anode materials. Furthermore, the average voltage is 1.58 V, comparable with that of commercial TiO2 anode materials for LIBs (1.5 V). During the charge/discharge process, graphether could mostly preserve the structural integrity upon the adsorption of Na even at the maximum concentration, suggesting its good reversibility. All these results show that graphether is a promising anode material for high-performance SIBs.",

In this study, we put forward substituting an inert phosphate with a redox-active silicate to improve the energy density and intrinsic electroconductivity of polyanion-type phosphate materials, thus enabling an advance in sodium-ion battery cathodes. As a proof of concept, some of the phosphate of Na3V2(PO4)3 was replaced by silicate to fabricate Na3V2(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1, which exhibited a higher average discharge voltage of 3.36 V and a higher capacity of 115.8 mA h g-1 than pristine Na3V2(PO4)3 (3.31 V, 109.6 mA h g-1) at 0.5 C, therefore improving the energy density. Moreover, the introduced silicate enhanced the intrinsic electroconductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3 materials, as confirmed by both theoretical simulation and electrochemical measurements. After pairing with a commercial hard carbon anode, the optimized Na3V2(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1 cathode enabled a stable-cycling full cell with 90.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 5 C and a remarkable average coulombic efficiency of 99.88%.",

By inserting NH4+ into the interlayer of MoS2, the interlayer spacing of MoS2 was successfully expanded to 0.98 nm. Further use of N plasma treatment achieved the doping of N element. The results show that N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) exhibits a high specific capacity of 542 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles at 200 mA g-1.

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (SIB) are among the most promising devices for large scale energy storage. Their stable and long-term performance depends on the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), a nanosized, heterogeneous and disordered layer, formed due to degradation of the electrolyte at the anode surface. The chemical and structural properties of the SEI control the charge transfer process at the electrode–electrolyte interface, thus, there is great interest in determining these properties for understanding, and ultimately controlling, SEI functionality. However, the study of the SEI is notoriously challenging due to its heterogeneous nature and minute quantity. In this work, we present a powerful approach for probing the SEI based on solid state NMR spectroscopy with increased sensitivity from dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). Utilizing exogenous (organic radicals) and endogenous (paramagnetic metal ion dopants) DNP sources, we obtain not only a detailed compositional map of the SEI but also, for the first time for the native SEI, determine the spatial distribution of its constituent phases. Using this approach, we perform a thorough investigation of the SEI formed on Li4Ti5O12 used as a SIB anode. We identify a compositional gradient, from organic phases at the electrolyte interface to inorganic phases toward the anode surface. We find that the use of fluoroethylene carbonate as an electrolyte additive leads to performance degradation which can be attributed to formation of a thicker SEI, rich in NaF and carbonates. We expect that this methodology can be extended to examine other titanate anodes and new electrolyte compositions, offering a unique tool for SEI investigations to enable the development of effective and long-lasting SIBs.",

As a remedy, we here present a novel aqueous electrolyte, which inhibits the PTCDA dissolution and enables their use as all‐organic ASIB anodes with high capacity retention and Coulombic efficiencies. Furthermore, the electrolyte is based on two, hence “hybrid”, inexpensive and non‐fluorinated Na/Mg‐salts, it displays favourable physico‐chemical properties and an electrochemical stability window >3 V without resorting to the extreme salt concentrations of water‐in‐salt electrolytes.

        "abstract": "Zinc sulfide (ZnS) exhibits promise in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of its low operation voltage and high theoretical specific capacity. However, pristine ZnS is not adequate in realizing rapid and robust sodium storage owing to its low reversibility, poor structure stability, and sluggish kinetics. To date, most efforts focus on utilizing carbonaceous incorporation to improve its electrochemical performances. Nevertheless, it remains an arduous challenge for realizing superior rate capability while obtaining stable cycling. Herein, inspired by the crystal structure of hexagonal ZnIn2S4, which possesses an intrinsic layered feature with larger unit-cell volume versus that of ZnS, indium incorporation is thus deployed as an immediate remedy. In/ex situ investigations combined with density functional theory calculations are conducted to reveal the superior kinetics, high reversibility, and good structure stability of ZnIn2S4. Notably, the formed indium-based derivatives during cycling manifest a Na+ (de)intercalation process, thereby exciting a synergetic mechanism to stabilize electrochemical cycling. As a result, the electrochemical performances of Zn-based sulfide are significantly improved via the indium incorporation. Furthermore, a full cell based on the ZnIn2S4 anode with the superior electrochemical performance is developed. This work provides an effective tactic of heteroatom incorporation for optimizing structure as well as exciting a complementary reaction process toward developing superior anodes for high-performance alkali-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Iron sulfide (FeS) has been extensively studied as sodium‐ion battery anodes due to its high theoretical capacity (609 mAh g−1), but its large volume expansion and low electrical conductivity result in unsatisfactory cycling life and poor rate performance. Moreover, the sodium ion storage mechanism of FeS at a voltage range of 0.01–1 V involving conversion reactions and subsequent ion storage process is unclear yet. Here, the study proposes a vapor‐pressure induced synthesis route to fabricate FeS/C yolk‐shell structure that ultrathin carbon layers coat on the surface of FeS nanosheets, which can accommodate volume expansion of FeS during sodiation observed via in situ transmission electron microscope and improve its electrical conductivity. Remarkably, an in situ magnetometry reveals that vast spin‐polarized electrons can be injected into superparamagnetic Fe nanoparticles (≈3 nm) formed during conversion reaction to induce evolution of electrode magnetization between 0.01 and 1 V, during which spin‐polarized surface capacitance effect occurs at Fe/Na2S interfaces to increase extra ion storage and boost ion transport stably. Consequently, the FeS/C yolk‐shell nanosheets deliver a high reversible capacity of 664.9 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, and 300.4 mAh g−1 after 10 000 cycles at 10 A g−1 with a capacity retention of 81.1%.",

The proficient cycling durability and good rate performance of SIBs are the two key parameters that determine their potential for practical use. In this study, nature-inspired three-dimensional (3D) MoS2 ultrathin marigold flower-like microstructures were prepared by a controlled hydrothermal method. These microscale flowers are constructed by arbitrarily arranged but closely interconnected two-dimensional ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets. The as-prepared MoS2 microflowers (MFs) have then been chemically wrapped by layered graphene sheets to form the bonded 3D hybrid MoS2-G networks. TEM, SEM, XRD, XPS, and Raman characterizations were used to study the morphology, crystallization, chemical compositions, and wrapping contact between MoS2 and graphene. The ultrathin nature of MoS2 in 3D MFs and graphene wrapping provide strong electrical conductive channels and conductive networks in an electrode. Benefitting from the 2 nm ultrathin crystalline MoS2 sheets, chemically bonded graphene, defect-induced sodium storage active sites, and 3D interstitial spaces, the prepared electrode exhibited an outstanding specific capacity (606 mA h g-1 at 200 mA g-1), remarkable rate performance (345 mA h g-1 at 1600 mA g-1), and long cycle life (over 100 cycles with tremendous Coulombic efficiencies beyond 100%).

        "abstract": "Porous carbon has been widely focused to solve the problems of low coulombic efficiency (ICE) and low multiplication capacity of Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) anodes. The superior energy storage properties of two-dimensional(2D) carbon nanosheets can be realized by modulating the structure, but be limited by the carbon sources, making it challenging to obtain 2D structures with large surface area. In this work, a new method for forming carbon materials with high N/S doping content based on combustion activation using the dual activation effect of K2 SO4 /KNO3 is proposed. The synthesized carbon material as an anode for SIBs has a high reversible capacity of 344.44 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 . Even at the current density of 5 Ag-1 , the capacity remained at 143.08 mAh g-1 . And the ICE of sodium-ion in ether electrolytes is ≈2.5 times higher than that in ester electrolytes. The sodium storage mechanism of ether/ester-based electrolytes is further explored through ex-situ characterizations. The disparity in electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the discrepancy in kinetics, wherein ether-based electrolytes exhibit a higher rate of Na+ storage and shedding compared to ester-based electrolytes. This work suggests an effective way to develop doubly doped carbon anode materials for SIBs.",

The amorphous cross-linked structure, formed by inter-molecular hydrogen bonds among functional groups in two polymers, can effectively enhance the flexibility and strength of the binder, resulting in strong adhesion between binder and other components in silicon anodes. Besides, this binder can tolerate large volume change and reduce the pulverization of silicon during the charge/discharge process. The hydrogen bonds of the binder keep the anode integrity during the volume change, leading to an excellent cycling stability and superior rate ability with a capacity of 1863 mAh g-1 at 500 mA g-1 after 150 cycles.

        "abstract": "Metal selenides, as potential alternative candidates for sodium storage, have promising applicability due to their high theoretical specific capacity. However, their huge volume change and sluggish electrode kinetics during sodium ion uptake and release processes can result in insufficient cycling life and inferior rate performance, hindering their practical application. Herein, nitrogen (N)-doped carbon-confined cobalt selenide anchored on multiwalled carbon nanotube networks (denoted as CoSe2@NC/MWCNTs) was designed and successfully built through a selenization process with ZIF-67 MOF as the template. The existence of the interconnected MWCNT network plays a crucial role in not only enhancing the electronic conductivity and ion/electron-transfer efficiency but also ensuring structural stability. Consequently, the optimized CoSe2@NC/MWCNTs composite delivers a high reversible capacity of 479.6 mA h g-1 at a current rate of 0.2 A g-1, accompanied by a 92.0% capacity retention over 100 cycles and a predominant rate performance of 227.4 mA h g-1 even under 20 A g-1 when examined as the anode in Na-ion batteries. Moreover, the kinetic behaviors were confirmed using CV profiles at various rates, as well as the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Besides, the HRTEM images clearly reveal the sodium-ion storage mechanism of the CoSe2 hybrid. These results make CoSe2@NC/MWCNTs a prospective anode material in advanced sodium-ion batteries.",

Nevertheless, the poor cycling stability and rate performance still impede its practical implantation. Here, CoSe2/nitrogen-doped carbon-skeleton hybrid microcubes with a TiO2 layer (denoted as TNC-CoSe2) are favorably prepared via a facile template-engaged strategy, in which a TiO2-coated Prussian blue analogue of Co3[Co(CN)6]2 is used as a new precursor accompanied with a selenization procedure. Such structures can concurrently boost ion and electron diffusion kinetics and inhibit the structural degradation during cycling through the close contact between the TiO2 layer and NC-CoSe2. Besides, this hybrid structure promotes the superior Na-ion intercalation pseudocapacitance due to the well-designed interfaces. The as-prepared TNC-CoSe2 microcubes exhibit a superior cycling capability (511 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 200 cycles) and long cycling life (456 mA h g-1 at 6.4 A g-1 for 6000 cycles with a retention of 92.7%).

Herein, we find that electrostatic modification of acidified carbon nanotubes with polyamines can introduce active sites and modulate the surface pH microenvironment, thereby developing a route to realize the in situ coaxial nanometerization of sodium titanate (nCNT@NTO). The nCNT@NTO anode material has a fast Na+ transport and the high capacitive contribution, which can deliver a high specific capacity (206.5 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1) and high rate performance (maintain 51% capacity at 10 A g-1), and the ideal cycle stability (∼93% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 5 A g-1). In addition, acrylate-rubber with high stickiness and stretchability are served as the elastic matrix both of the stretchable electrodes and quasi-solid-state electrolytes, which endows strong adhesion between electrodes and electrolytes. Thus, the accordingly assembled SSIC delivers high energy density of 8.8 mW h cm-3 (at a power density of 0.024 W cm-3), and excellent deformation stability (89% capacitance retention after 500 stretching cycles under 100% strain).",

All the cells are fabricated using Na3.1V2P2.9Si0.1O12, Na3.456Mg0.128Zr1.872Si2.2P0.8O12, and Na as a cathode AM, solid electrolyte (SE) and anode, respectively. The AM/SE interface is modified by (1) wetting the interface with organic liquid electrolyte (LE), (2) slurry casting and sintering a thin layer of composite cathode, and (3) infiltrating AM precursors inside the porous SE structure followed by drying and sintering. Despite exhibiting a stable cyclability performance, the SSBs prepared using the LE modification and composite cathode approach possess a low AM loading of < 1 mg·cm−2. On the other hand, the SSBs with infiltrated‐cathode exhibit a superior discharge capacity of ∼ 102 mAh·g−1 at 0.2C and less than 5% capacity fading after 50 cycles at room temperature. Notably, these cells contain a high AM loading of 2.12 mg·cm−2. The microstructural analysis reveals the presence of AM particles inside the pores of the porous SE, allowing for the efficient insertion/removal of sodium ions. The porous scaffold of SE not only provides continuous sodium‐ion conduction pathways inside the cathode structure but also renders stability by accommodating stress induced by volume change during repeated cycling. The outcomes of this work demonstrate the effectiveness of the wet‐chemical infiltration technique in improving the AM loading and storage capacity performance of SSBs working at 25°C.",

Herein, a structural dimensionality reduction strategy is proposed and developed by converting 2D‐layer‐structured Bi into a quasi‐1D structured NiBi3 with enhanced reaction kinetics and reversibility to realize high‐rate and stable cycling performance for Na/K‐ion storage. As a proof of concept, the quasi‐1D intermetallic NiBi3 with low formation energy, metallic conductivity, and 3D Na/K‐ion diffusion pathways delivers outstanding capacity retention of 94.1% (332 mAh g−1) after 15 000 cycles for Na‐ion storage, and high initial coulombic efficiency of 93.4% with improved capacity retention for K‐ion storage. Moreover, investigations on the highly reversible Na/K‐storage reaction mechanisms and cycling‐driven morphology reconstruction further reveal the origins of the high reversibility and the accommodation to volume expansion.

The conductive 3D interconnected multichannel nanostructure of CoS2/MCNFs provides efficient buffer zones for the release of mechanical stresses from Na+ ions intercalation/deintercalation. The synergy of the diverse structural features enables a robust frame and a rapid electrochemical reaction in CoS2/MCNFs anode, resulting in an impressive long-term cycling life of 900 cycles with a capacity of 620 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 (86.4% theoretical capacity) and a surprisingly high-power output.

In addition, flexible Na‐HSC devices have scarcely been demonstrated by far. Herein, an in situ encapsulation strategy is devised to directly grow ultrathin graphene shells over T‐Nb2O5 nanowires (denoted as Gr‐Nb2O5 composites) by plasma‐enhanced chemical vapor deposition, targeting a highly conductive anode material for Na‐HSCs. The few‐layered graphene capsules with ample topological defects would enable facile electron and Na+ ion transport, guaranteeing rapid pseudocapacitive processes at the Nb2O5/electrolyte interface. The Na‐HSC full‐cell comprising a Gr‐Nb2O5 anode and an activated carbon cathode delivers high energy/power densities (112.9 Wh kg−1/80.1 W kg−1 and 62.2 Wh kg−1/5330 W kg−1), outperforming those of recently reported Na‐HSC counterparts. Proof‐of‐concept Na‐HSC devices with favorable mechanical robustness manifest stable electrochemical performances under different bending conditions and after various bending–release cycles.",

        "abstract": "Bismuth (Bi) have been demonstrated as promising anode for Na-ion batteries (NIBs) because it has high gravimetry (386 mAh g-1) and volumetric capacity (3800 mAh cm-3). However, Bi suffers from large volume expansion during sodiation, leading to poor electrochemical performance. Construction nanostructure with sufficient void space to accommodate the volume change has been proven effective for achieving prolonged cycling stability. But the excessive void space will definitely decrease the volumetric energy density of battery. Herein, we design an optimized Bi@Void@C nanospheres (Bi@Void@C-2) with yolk-shell structure that exhibits the best cycling performance and enhanced volumetric energy density. The optimized void space could not only buffer the volume change of the Bi nanosphere, but also could keep the high volumetric energy density of battery. The Bi@Void@C-2 shows an excellent rate capacity of 173 mAh g-1 at ultra-high current density of 100 A g-1 and long-cycle life (198 mAh g-1 at 20A g-1 over 10000 cycles). The origin of the superior performance is achieved through in-depth fundamental studies during battery operation using in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and in-situ transmission electron microscope (TEM), complemented by theoretical calculations and ex-situ TEM observation. Our rational design provides insights for anode materials with large volume variation, especially for conversion type and alloying type mechanism materials for batteries (i.e. Li-ion batteries, Na-ion batteries).",

Among the various electrolytes investigated, sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI) (0.5 M) in BMPTFSI shows the best electrochemical performance with a significant improvement in cycling stability (90% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 50 mA g-1 in a half cell versus Na metal anode) compared with conventional NaClO4 (1 M) in ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate electrolytes (39% retention after 500 cycles). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies reveal that ionic liquid electrolytes are stable up to 4.8 V versus Na/Na+. When NaFSI and NaTFSI are used as conducting salts, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results prove that the cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) is composed of components resulting from the decomposition of the TFSI anion and the deposition of the BMP cation. On the other hand, the CEI layer of the electrode cycled in an electrolyte containing NaClO4 in BMPTFSI follows a different pathway of TFSI decomposition and consists mainly of sodium fluoride. Similarly, plating studies were used to understand the stability of different ionic liquids in contact with metallic sodium. It was found that the excellent capacity retention for the electrolyte consisting of NaFSI salt is related to the formation of a stable CEI and solid electrolyte interphase layers.",

        "title": "Stable Sodium‐Metal Batteries in Carbonate Electrolytes Achieved by Bifunctional, Sustainable Separators with Tailored Alignment",
        "abstract": "Sodium (Na) is the most appealing alternative to lithium as an anode material for cost‐effective, high‐energy‐density energy‐storage systems by virtue of its high theoretical capacity and abundance as a resource. However, the uncontrolled growth of Na dendrites and the limited cell cycle life impede the large‐scale practical implementation of Na‐metal batteries (SMBs) in commonly used and low‐cost carbonate electrolytes. Herein, the employment of a novel bifunctional electrospun nanofibrous separator comprising well‐ordered, uniaxially aligned arrays, and abundant sodiophilic functional groups is presented for SMBs. By tailoring the alignment degree, this unique separator integrates with the merits of serving as highly aligned ion‐redistributors to self‐orientate/homogenize the flux of Na‐ions from a chemical molecule level and physically suppressing Na dendrite puncture at a mechanical structure level. Remarkably, unprecedented long‐term cycling performances at high current densities (≥1000 h at 1 and 3 mA cm−2, ≥700 h at 5 mA cm−2) of symmetric cells are achieved in additive‐free carbonate electrolytes. Moreover, the corresponding sodium–organic battery demonstrates a high energy density and prolonged cyclability over 1000 cycles. This work opens up a new and facile avenue for the development of stable, low‐cost, and safe‐credible SMBs, which could be readily extended to other alkali‐metal batteries.",

Experimental results demonstrate that the simultaneous introduction of N and O generates a synergistic effect, increasing the surface oxygen-containing functional groups, defects, and interlayer spacing of coconut-shell-derived HC through the codoping of light elements. The excellent strategy has increased the slope capacity and platform capacity of HC, and the synergistic modification of N/O has increased its reversible specific capacity from 272 to 343 mA h g-1 (30 mA g-1), with a retention rate of approximately 92.1% after 100 cycles. In addition, it also exhibits an excellent rate performance, reaching 178 mA h g-1 at 1500 mA g-1. In summary, this study presents an effective strategy for modifying biomass-derived HC.",

However, designing ideal functional superstructures with excellent electrochemical properties is still a major challenge, and an in-depth understanding of the structure-activity relationship of electrodes remains to be achieved. To elucidate this critical issue, herein, we rationally designed and synthesized for the first time superstructured TiO2/dual-doped mesoporous carbon anodes using confined space and surface coassembly strategies. Our method primarily relied on the larger interlayer space few-layered MXene and its negatively charged surface, allowing hexamethylenetetramine intercalation and surface electrostatic adsorption. The superstructured TiO2/dual-doped mesoporous carbon was successfully assembled by the thermal decomposition of a confined carbon precursor. Subsequently, the comparison of Na+-storage properties of various anodes was carried out based on the results of structural characterization techniques and electrochemical analysis methods. The results showed that the optimized anode (N/O-C@TiO2-20) can deliver a reversible capacity of 165 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g-1, indicating excellent electrochemical properties. The enhancement can be attributed to the synergistic effect of carbon domains, defective nanocrystals, and a covalently coupled interface between TiO2 and mesoporous carbon. Our work not only offered a new strategy for the assembly and regulation of superstructures to promote the electrochemical performance but also enlightened the rational design of advanced anodes for sodium-ion battery application.",

Herein, density functional theory simulations for the first time optimize MoS2 interlayer distance between 0.80 and 1.01 nm for sodium storage. 1-Butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium acetate ([BMIm]Ac) induces cellulose oligomers to intercalate MoS2 interlayers for achieving controllable distance by changing the mass ratio of cellulose to [BMIm]Ac. Based on these findings, porous carbon loading the interlayer-expanded MoS2 allowing Na+ to insert with fast kinetics is synthesized. A carbon layer derived from [BMIm]Ac and cellulose coating the composite prevents the MoS2 from contacting electrolytes, leading to less sulfur loss for a more reversible specific capacity. Meanwhile, MoS2 and carbon have a strong interfacial connection through MoN binding, contributing to enhanced structural stability. As expected, while cycling 250 times at 0.1 A g-1 , the MoS2 -porous carbon composite displays an optimal reversible capacity at 517.79 mAh g-1 as a sodium-ion batteries anode. The cyclic test of 1.0 A g-1 also shows considerable stability (310.74 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles with 86.26% retentive capacity).

        "abstract": "While the focus of research related to the design of robust, high-performance Li-ion batteries relates primarily to the synthesis of active particles, the binder plays a crucial role in stability and ensures electrode integrity during volume changes that occur with cycling. Conventional polymeric binders such as poly(vinylidene difluoride) generally do not interact with active particle surfaces and fail to accommodate large changes in particle spacing during cycling. Thus, attention is now turning toward the exploration of interfacial interactions between composite electrode constituents as a key element in ensuring electrode stability. Recently, a poly[3-(potassium-4-butanoate)thiophene] (PPBT) binder component, coupled with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) surface coating for the active material was demonstrated to enhance both electron and ion transport in magnetite-based anodes, and it was established that the PEG/PPBT approach aids in overall battery electrode performance. Herein, the PEG/PPBT system is used as a model polymeric binder for understanding cation effects in anode systems. As such, the potassium ion was replaced with sodium, lithium, hydrogen, and ammonium through ion exchange. The potassium salt exhibited the most stable electrochemical performance, which is attributed to the cation size and resultant electrode morphology that facilitates ion transport. The lithium analogue demonstrated an initial increase in capacity but was unable to maintain this performance over 100 cycles; while the sodium-based system exhibited initially lower capacity as a result of slow reaction kinetics, which increased as cycling progressed. The parent carboxylic acid polymer and its ammonium salt were notably inferior. The results exploring the effect of ion exchange creates a framework for understanding how cations associated directly with the polymer impact electrochemical performance and aid in the overall design of binders for composite Li-ion battery anodes.",

N-doped carbon layers provided a robust network for the CoS2 nanoparticles, enhancing the structural integrity and electronic conductivity of the resulting CoS2/C/C composite, which exhibited electrochemical performance superior to most existing CoS2 composites, and was one of the best among all MOF derived CoS2 anodes for LIBs and SIBs. The use of nanosized CoS2 particles reduced the diffusion length for the transfer of Li+/Na+ ions, resulting in a high specific capacity at a higher current rate. N-doped carbon layers derived from the MOF precursor and polydopamine provided an electrically conductive network between the CoS2 nanoparticles, thus preventing their aggregation and inhibiting adverse side reactions between the electrolyte and the surface of the electrode, and the high pseudocapacitive contribution resulted in the enhanced rate performance of the CoS2/C/C electrodes.",

However, challenges persist in achiving prolonged cycling stability and consistent capacity, and the sodium storage mechanism in HC is still debated. Herein, an unreported biomass precursor, \"sisal,\" for deriving hard carbon is developed. A series of sisal hemp-derived hard carbon with natural 3D porous channels are prepared. Through phase characterization and electrochemical testing, the relationship between microstructure and sodium storage capacity is elucidated, further confirming the suitability of the \"adsorption-insertion-filling\" mechanism for sodium storage properties in hard carbon materials. Without the need for any additional modification strategies, this biomass-derived hard carbon demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance in both sodium-ion and potassium-ion batteries (SIBs and PIBs). The as-prepared HC-1300 demonstrates excellent ion storage capability, delivering a high reversible capacity of 345.2 mAh g-1 in SIBs and 310 mAh g-1 in PIBs at 0.1 C. Moreover, it maintains a specific capacity of 237.3 mAh g-1 over 1200 cycles at 1 C when used in SIBs.

The incorporation of OVs into TiO2 is demonstrated to render considerably enhanced-rate performances, higher initial capacities, and an accelerated electrochemical activation process during cycling, derived from the boosted intrinsic electric conductivity and improved kinetics of Na uptake. Bestowed with the integrated merits of OVs and shortened Na ion diffusion length in the nanostructure, black titania delivers a reversible specific capacity of 207.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, retains 99.1% over 500 cycles at 1 C stably, and still maintains 91.2 mAh g(-1) even at the high rate of 20 C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the lower sodiation energy barrier of anatase with OVs enables a more favorable Na intercalation into black anatase. Thus, it is of great significance to introduce OVs into TiO2 to stimulate ultrafast and durable sodium-storage properties, which also offers a potential strategy to project more superior electrodes, utilizing internal defects.",

Through tuning graphene layer covered on the top surface of interdigital microelectrodes, the NIMCs unveil remarkably enhanced power density, owing to the establishment of favorable multidirectional fast ion diffusion pathways that significantly reduce the charge transfer resistance. Meanwhile, the as‐fabricated NIMCs present excellent mechanical flexibility without capacitance fade under repeated deformation, and electrochemical stability at a high temperature of 80 °C because of using nonflammable ionogel electrolyte and in‐plane geometry.

All composites show enhancement in the overall capacity and cycling stability compared to the pristine CuP2 due to the well‐connected CNTs on and between the CuP2 particles.

However, the intrinsic pulverization and aggregation of iron sulfide electrodes induced by the conversion reaction during cycling are considered destructive and undesirable, which often impedes their capacity, rate capability, and long-term cycling stability. Herein, an interesting pulverization phenomenon of ultrathin carbon-coated Fe1- xS nanoplates (Fe1- xS@C) is observed during the first discharge process of sodium-ion batteries, which leads to the formation of Fe1- xS nanoparticles with quantum size (≈5 nm) tightly embedded in the carbon matrix. Surprisingly, no discernible aggregation phenomenon can be detected in subsequent cycles. In/ex situ experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrate that ultrafine pulverization can confer several advantages, including sustaining reversible conversion reactions, reducing the adsorption energies, and diffusion energy barriers of sodium atoms, and preventing the aggregation of Fe1- xS particles by strengthening the adsorption between pulverized Fe1- xS nanoparticles and carbon. As a result, benefiting from the unique ultrafine pulverization, the Fe1- xS@C anode simultaneously exhibits high reversible capacity (610 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1), superior rate capability (427.9 mAh g-1 at 20 A g-1), and ultralong cycling stability (377.9 mAh g-1 after 2500 cycles at 20 A g-1).",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon anodes with all‐plateau capacities below 0.1 V are prerequisites to achieve high‐energy‐density sodium‐ion storage, which holds promise for future sustainable energy technologies. However, challenges in removing defects and improving the insertion of sodium ions head off the development of hard carbon to achieve this goal. Herein, a highly cross‐linked topological graphitized carbon using biomass corn cobs through a two‐step rapid thermal‐annealing strategy is reported. The topological graphitized carbon constructed with long‐range graphene nanoribbons and cavities/tunnels provides a multidirectional insertion of sodium ions whilst eliminating defects to absorb sodium ions at the high voltage region. Evidence from advanced techniques including in situ XRD, in situ Raman, and in situ/ex situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicates that the sodium ions' insertion and Na cluster formation occurred between curved topological graphite layers and in the topological cavity of adjacent graphite band entanglements. The reported topological insertion mechanism enables outstanding battery performance with a single full low‐voltage plateau capacity of 290 mAh g−1, which is almost 97% of the total capacity.",

        "title": "Manipulating Interfacial Renovation via In Situ Formed Metal Fluoride Heterogeneous Protective Layer toward Exceptional Durable Sodium Metal Anodes",
        "abstract": "Sodium metal is regarded as an optimal anode material for high‐energy‐density sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, during the processes of sodium deposition and stripping, the failure of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film leads to the continuous accumulation of inactive sodium, thereby compromising the cycling reversibility of the battery. Here, a novel metal fluoride heterointerface layer is generated and constructed through in situ manipulation of the continuous reaction between TiF4 and metal Na. The reconstructed NaF/TiF3 interface layer, which tightly anchors the sodium metal, effectively suppresses the formation of sodium dendrites during the charge‐discharge process. The highly sodium‐philic TiF3 component exhibits strong binding with Na ions, while NaF reduces the Na+ diffusion energy barrier, significantly enhancing the reaction kinetics. Due to the successful artificial construction of this interface layer, the Na/TiF4 composite electrode demonstrates an exceptional ultra‐long cycling stability of 2370 h in symmetric cells (0.5 mAh cm−2). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further validate the functionality of each component in the Na/TiF4 protective layer. When paired with NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode in a pouch cell, it exhibits stability up to 2000 cycles at current densities of 2 C and 4 C, with a maximum energy density output of 483.1 Wh kg−1 (power density: 320.8 W kg−1).",

However, the huge volume changes during a charge/discharge process and poor conductivity of FeS2 hindered its practical applications. Herein, we propose a facile scalable approach to prepare nanostructured FeS2 embedded in an N-doped carbon nanosheet composite (FeS2/CNS) via a combined template method and a solid state sulfuration method. N-Doped carbon nanosheets are believed to alleviate the volume variation and enhance the conductivity of an electrode, and the nanoscale particle size with an average diameter of 50-80 nm can shorten the ion-diffusion paths during a sodiation/desodiation process. As a result, the FeS2/CNS electrode exhibits high specific capacity (812 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), long cycling life (77.2% capacity retention after 350 cycles at 1 A g-1) and excellent rate capability (400 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1) when tested as an anode material for SIBs.

        "abstract": "Phosphorus represents a promising anode material for sodium ion batteries owing to its extremely high theoretical capacity. Recent in situ transmission electron microscopy studies evidenced anisotropic swelling in sodiated black phosphorus, which may find an origin from the two intrinsic anisotropic properties inherent to the layered structure of black phosphorus: sodium diffusional directionality and insertion strain anisotropy. To understand the morphological evolution and stress generation in sodiated black phosphorus, we develop a chemo-mechanical model by incorporating the intrinsic anisotropic properties into the large elasto-plastic deformation. Our modeling results reveal that the apparent morphological evolution in sodiated black phosphorus is critically controlled by the coupled effect of the two intrinsic anisotropic properties. In particular, sodium diffusional directionality generates sharp interphases along the [010] and [001] directions, which constrain anisotropic development of the insertion strain. The coupled effect renders distinctive stress-generation and fracture mechanisms when sodiation starts from different crystal facets. In addition to providing a powerful modeling framework for sodiation and lithiation of layered structures, our findings shed significant light on the sodiation-induced chemo-mechanical degradation of black phosphorus as a promising anode for the next-generation sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The kinetics incompatibility between battery-type anode and capacitive-type cathode for sodium ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) seriously hinders their overall performance output. Herein, we construct a SIHCs device by coupling with quantum grade vanadium nitride (VN) nanodots anchored in one-dimensional N/F co-doped carbon nanofiber cages hybrids (VNQDs@PCNFs-N/F) as the freestanding anode and the corresponding activated N/F co-doped carbon nanofiber cages (APCNFs-N/F) as cathode. The strong coupling of VN quantum dots with N/F co-doped 1D conductive carbon cages effectively facilitates the ion/electron transport and intercalation-conversion-deintercalation reactions, ensuring fast sodium storage to surmount aforesaid kinetics incompatibility. Additionally, density functional theory calculations cogently manifest that the abundant active sites in the VNQDs@PCNFs-N/F configuration boost the Na+ adsorption/reaction activity well which will promote both \"intrinsic\" and \"extrinsic\" pseudocapacitance and further improve anode kinetics. Consequently, the assembled SIHCs device can achieve high energy densities of 157.1 and 95.0 Wh kg-1 at power densities of 198.8 and 9100.5 W kg-1, respectively, with an ultralong cycling life over 8000 cycles.

Mesoporous carbons, either as active materials or as hosts for guest active nanoparticles, are considered as promising electrode materials. However, addressing the issues of their short lifespan resulting from volume variation and the low coulombic efficiency caused by large surface area via a facile porous structure design still remains a challenge. Herein, a versatile phosphorus‐doped mesoporous carbon (PMC) armed is developed by graphene aerogel (GA) (GA@PMC) for hosting Na‐storage active nanoparticles. As a case study, FeSe2 nanoparticles are selectively supported onto this GA@PMC matrix, creating the FeSe2/GA@PMC composite. When employed in typical Na‐storage devices, such as Na‐ion batteries, Na‐ion hybrid capacitors, and Na‐ion based dual‐ion batteries, the FeSe2/GA@PMC electrode consistently demonstrates superior electrochemical performance. In such GA@PMC, the conformal GA can improve the entire conductivity while decreasing the specific surface area that is directly contacting with electrolyte. The interconnected macroporous structure can not only promote the diffusion of Na+ but also buffers the volume change of the guest active nanoparticles. This bespoke carbon platform synergistically endows the electrode material with enhanced rate capability, cyclic stability, and coulombic efficiency, which are being expected in advanced Na‐storage devices.",

Notably, the synergetic effect of the heterogeneous structure is maximized by inducing the interfacial coupling SbOC and creating buffering space for the volume effect of Sb. The high-entropy phase interface creates the doping site breaking the periodicity of atoms and alters the electronic structure, also bridging the slip of intergranular defects.

Herein, we propose the sodiation/desodiation reaction mechanism of 2D few-layer antimonene (FLA) based on results acquired by in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, ex situ selected-area electron diffraction, and theoretical simulations. Our study shows that the FLA undergoes anisotropic volume expansion along the a/b plane and exhibits reversible crystalline phase evolution (Sb ⇋ NaSb ⇋ Na3Sb) during cycling. Density-functional theory calculations demonstrate that the FLA has a small Na-ion diffusion barrier of 0.14 eV. The FLA delivers a larger capacity of 642 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C (1 C = 660 mA g-1) and a high rate capability of 429 mAh g-1 at 5 C and maintains a stable capacity of 620 mA g-1 at 0.5 C with 99.7% capacity retention from the 10th to the 150th cycle.

To better understand the underlying mechanism of the pillar effect in enhancing the electrochemical performance, first-principles calculations were used to investigate the adsorption and diffusion of Na in MXenes (Ti2CO2 and Ti3C2O2), as well as the mechanical properties of the system under different MXenes layer spacings. The results showed that when the MXene layer spacing was ∼4 Å, the strongest adsorption of Na on MXenes was achieved due to the interlayer synergy effect. However, when the MXene layer spacing was greater than 5 Å, double Na-atomic layer adsorption would be formed, which increased the Na storage capacity. Interestingly, the diffusion of Na was not only affected by the interlayer spacing of MXenes, but also by the interlayer stacking mode of MXenes. Moreover, it was found that when the MXene layer spacing was more than 8 Å, the sodium storage properties basically did not change significantly. The optimal layer spacing for Ti2CO2 and Ti3C2O2 was predicted to be 7 and 6 Å, respectively.

        "abstract": "Engineering intriguing electrode with exceptional kinetics behaviors is imperative for boosting sodium storage systems. Herein, the uniform nanoframes are threaded by the interwoven carbon nanotube (CNT) conductive network to form an ingenious beads-on-a-string structured NiFePBA nanoframe/CNT (NFPB-NF/CNT) cathode and the corresponding derivative NiFeSe nanoframe/CNT (NFS-NF/CNT) anode. NFPB-NF/CNT exhibited remarkable cycling life along with outstanding rate capability and low voltage decay per cycle. The fast Na+ conduction and sufficient sodiation reaction is proved using Na+ diffusion models. Meanwhile, an exceptional sodium storage capacity and prolonged cycling life is achieved using binary NFS-NF/CNT anode at a high rate. In situ and ex situ investigations are used to reveal the sodium storage mechanisms and structural evolution process. Furthermore, a sodium-ion full battery based on the above electrodes shows stable performance accompanied by high energy conversion efficiency. The material design strategy provides a new solution for exploiting smart multicomponent composites toward advanced energy storage devices.",

Compared with conventional monovalent ion batteries like lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries, multivalent ion batteries have attracted extensive attention owing to their high energy densities. Here, we systematically explore the interactions between Mg atoms and α-beryllene monolayers by means of density functional theory calculations. Mg atoms can be adsorbed stably on α-beryllene monolayers with the adsorption energy of -0.24 eV. The low diffusion energy barriers (0.099/0.101 eV) indicate the rapid mobility of Mg during the charge/discharge process. Moreover, the α-beryllene monolayer exhibits an ultra-high theoretical specific capacity of 5956 mA h g-1 for Mg, a low average open-circuit voltage of 0.24 V, and a tiny volume change of -1.08%. Finally, the constructed h-BN/α-beryllene heterostructure shows that h-BN can serve as a protective cover to preserve pristine α-beryllene in respect of metallicity, Mg adsorption capability, and fast ionic mobility. The above mentioned outstanding results make α-beryllene a promising anode material for magnesium-ion batteries.",

However, their cycling performance is limited by large volume variation, severe aggregation, and pulverization of bimetallic oxide nanoparticles during repeated metal ion insertion/extraction processes. Herein, bimetallic antimony-vanadium oxide nanoparticles embedded in graphene (SbVO4/G) composites are prepared by a one-step hydrothermal method. Bimetallic SbVO4 with abundant redox reaction sites can provide high specific capacity by a multi-electron reaction. A robust graphene substrate can not only alleviate volume expansion but also prevent aggregation and collapse of highly active bimetallic SbVO4. Due to the excellent synergy between the two building components, SbVO4/G hybrids exhibit excellent electrochemical activity, structural stability, and electrochemical performance. When employed as anodes for LIBs and SIBs, SbVO4/G composites display excellent cycling performance (1079.5 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 150 cycles for LIBs and 401.6 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 450 cycles for SIBs) and impressive rate capability.

As expected, Vs-SMS@C releases an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 1089 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 , higher than the theoretical capacity. It delivers a satisfactory capacity of 463 mAh g-1 at a high current density of 10 A g-1 , which is the state-of-the-art rate capability compared to other MoS2 based sodium ion battery anodes to the knowledge. Moreover, a super long-term cycle stability is achieved by Vs-SMS@C, which keeps 91.6% of the initial capacity after 3000 cycles under the current density of 5 A g-1 in the voltage of 0.3-3.0 V.

Herein, a zirconium-based metal-organic framework nanostructure coating (ZMOF-NSC) was constructed in a low-loss, flexible manner. Comprehensive studies show that ZMOF-NSC, with its periodically ordered nanochannels and organized pore structures, enhances ion transport and decreases the Na+ migration energy barrier, thus ensuring uniform ion flux and achieving uniform spherical deposition. Additionally, ZMOF-NSC facilitates partial desolvation, catalyzing the formation of an inorganic-rich, dual-layered SEI that effectively protects the anode and suppresses dendrite formation. Consequently, the ZMOF-NSC@Na symmetric battery exhibits an impressive lifespan of over 2500 h, demonstrating extended operational longevity. The Na3V2(PO4)3∥ZMOF-NSC@Na batteries demonstrate exceptional cycling stability with 81% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 10 C, maintaining stability over 3000 cycles at 20 C. Moreover, the NVP∥ZMOF-NSC@Na battery achieves an energy density of 370 Wh kg-1 and a power density of 10,484 W kg-1, indicating superior durability and performance. This significant finding highlights the significant potential of structured MOFs to induce a dual-layered SEI, advancing the commercialization of durable, dendrite-free sodium metal batteries.

        "abstract": "Presently, considerable attention has been paid to the Fe-based dichalcogenides as anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) due to their abundant resources, chemical stability, and high theoretical capacity. In this paper, we make nanooctahedra particles assembled FeSe2 microspheres embedded into sulfur-doped reduced graphene oxide sheets through a one-step hydrothermal reduction route, in which the reduction of graphene oxide, the doping of sulfur atoms, and the preparation of FeSe2/sulfur-doped reduced graphene oxide (FeSe2/SG) composites are realized at the same time. When serving as anodes for SIBs, the FeSe2/SG electrode can display superior electrochemical performances with a large reversible capacity of 447.5 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) and an excellent rate capability of 383.3 and 277.5 mA h g(-1) at the current density of 2.0 and 5.0 A g(-1), which could be attributed to the introduction of sulfur atoms into the reduced graphene oxide structure and the synergistic effect between microsphere-like FeSe2 particles and sulfur-doped reduced graphene oxide sheets.",

Herein, we propose a wide-temperature SIB, which involves a carbon-coated Na 4 Fe 3 (PO 4 ) 2 P 2 O 7 (NFPP@C) cathode, a Bismuth (Bi) anode, and a diglyme-based electrolyte. We demonstrate that solvated Na + can be directly stored by the Bi anode via an alloying reaction without the de-solvent process.  Furthermore, the NFPP@C cathode exhibits a high Na + diffusion coefficient at low temperature. As a result, the Bi//NFPP@C battery exhibits perfect low-temperature behavior. Even at -70 °C, this battery still delivers 70.19% of the room-temperature capacity. Furthermore, benefitting from the high boiling point of the electrolyte, this battery also works well at a high temperature up to 100 °C. These encourage results might shed light on the exploration of wide-temperature SIBs.",

We report a sodium storage mechanism and properties of a new anode material, digenite Cu1.8S, based on its crystallographic study. It is revealed that copper sulfides (Cu xS) can have metal-rich formulas ( x ≥ 1.6), due to the unique oxidation state of +1 found in group 11 elements. These phases enable the unit cell to consist of all strong Cu-S bonds and no direct S-S bonds, which are vulnerable to external stress/strain that could result in bond cleavage as well as decomposition. Because of its structural rigidness, the Cu1.8S shows an intercalation/deintercalation reaction mechanism even in a low potential window of 0.1-2.2 V versus Na/Na+ without irreversible phase transformation, which most of the metal sulfides experience through a conversion reaction mechanism. It uptakes, on average, 1.4 Na+ ions per unit cell (∼250 mAh g-1) and exhibits ∼100% retention over 1000 cycles at 2C in a tuned voltage range of 0.5-2.2 V through an overall solid solution reaction with negligible phase separation.",

        "abstract": "As a potential alternative to lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted more and more attention due to the lower cost of sodium than lithium. Red phosphorus (RP) is an especially promising anode for SIBs with the highest theoretical capacity of 2596 mAh g-1, which faces the challenges of large volume change and low conductivity. Herein, we develop a nanoporous RP on reduced graphene oxide (NPRP@RGO) as a high-performance anode for SIBs through boiling. Its nanoporous structure could accommodate the volume change and minimize the ion diffusion length, and the high electronic conductive network built on RGO sheets facilitates the fast electron and ion transportation. As a result, NPRP@RGO exhibits a superhigh capacity (1249.7 mAh gcomposite-1 after 150 cycles at 173.26 mA gcomposite-1), superior rate capability (656.9 mAh gcomposite-1 at 3465.28 mA gcomposite-1), and ultralong cycle life at 5.12 A gRP-1 for RP-based electrodes (775.3 mAh gRP-1 after 1500 cycles).

        "abstract": "Unordered vacancies engineered in host anode materials cannot well maintain the uniform Na+ adsorbed and possibly render the local structural stress intense, resulting in electrode peeling and battery failure. Here, the indium is first introduced into Cu2Se to achieve the formation of CuInSe2. Next, an ion extraction strategy is employed to fabricate Cu0.54In1.15Se2 enriched with ordered vacancies by spontaneous formation of defect pairs. Such ordered defects, compared with unordered ones, can serve as myriad sodium ion micropumps evenly distributing in crystalline host to homogenize the adsorbed Na+ and the generated volumetric stress during the electrochemistry. Furthermore, Cu0.54In1.15Se2 is indeed proved by the calculations to exhibit smaller volumetric variation than the counterpart with unordered vacancies. Thanks to the distinct ordered vacancy structure, the material exhibits a highly reversible capacity of 428 mAh g−1 at 1 C and a high‐rate stability of 311.7 mAh g−1 at 10 C after 5000 cycles when employed as an anode material for Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). This work presents the promotive effect of ordered vacancies on the electrochemistry of SIBs and demonstrates the superiority to unordered vacancies, which is expected to extend it to other metal‐ion batteries, not limited to SIBs to achieve high capacity and cycling stability.",

Thereinto, Fe3S4 has a high theoretical specific capacity of 785 mAh g−1. However, at present, the research related to Fe3S4 anode for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) is still in its infancy, and it also suffers from severe volume expansion and limited preparation. Therefore, to further boost its sodium storage potential, the Fe3S4@rGO composite with hierarchical structure and carbonaceous network is proposed in this study. Beneficial from the ingenious hierarchitectures and flexible graphene coating, the Fe3S4@rGO anode exhibits outstanding sodium storage performance, which can deliver a high capacity of 603 mAh g−1 after 1500 cycles with a superior capacity retention of 98%. The micron flower‐like structure composed of 2D nanosheets can provide sufficient active sites and promote the rapid transport of Na+.

Titanium-based layered oxides have attracted widespread attention as promising anode materials due to delivering a safe potential of about 0.7 V (vs Na+/Na) and a small volume contraction during cycles; P2-type Ti-based layered oxides are typically reported, due to the challenging synthesis of the O3-type counterpart resulting from the high percentage of unstable Ti3+. Herein, we report an anomalous O3-Na2/3Ni1/3Ti2/3O2 layered oxide as an ultrastable and high-rate anode material for SIBs. The anode material delivers a reversible capacity of 112 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles at 0.1 C, a good capacity retention rate of 91% after 1400 cycles at 2 C, and, in particular, a capacity of 52 mA h g-1 even at a high rate of 20 C (1780 mA g-1). Furthermore, the in situ X-ray diffraction monitoring reveals no phase transitions and almost zero strain both underlie the good long-cycle stability. The measured high apparent Na+ diffusion coefficient (2.06 × 10-10 cm2 s-1) and the low migration energy barrier (0.59 eV) from density functional theory calculations are responsible for the superior rate capability. Our results promise advanced high-performance O3-type Ti-based layered oxides as promising anode materials toward application for SIBs.",

However, low electronic conductivity, severe particle agglomeration and lack of effective synthesis methods have still greatly hampered their rapid development. Herein, we initially fabricate a novel VSe1.5/CNF composite through a facile electrospinning method followed by selenization. The electrochemical measurements show that VSe1.5/CNFs can enable the rapid and durable storage of Li+, Na+, and K+ ions. When used as an anode material for LIBs, the VSe1.5/CNF composite delivers a high capacity of 932 mA h g-1 after 400 cycles at a high current density of 1 A g-1. In addition, for SIBs, the VSe1.5/CNF composite manifests a high reversible capacity of 668 mA h g-1 after 50 cycles and an excellent capacity of 265 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1 even after an ultra-long 6000 cycles. This is one of the best performances of vanadium-based anode materials for SIBs reported so far. Most remarkably, the VSe1.5/CNF composite also demonstrates a satisfactory reversible K+ storage performance. The simple synthetic route and excellent ion storage properties make the VSe1.5/CNF composite a great prospect for application as an anode material for alkali metal ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Low Na+ and electron diffusion kinetics severely restrain the rate capability of MoS2 as anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Slow phase transitions between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S as well as the volume change during cycling, induce a poor cycling stability. Herein, an original Fe single atom doped MoS2 hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) is designed for the first time to address the above challenges. The Fe single atom in MoS2 promotes the electron transfer, companying with shortened charge diffusion path from unique HoMS, thereby achieving excellent rate capability. The strong adsorption with Na+ and self-catalysis of Fe single atom facilitates the reversible conversion between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S. Moreover, the buffering effect of HoMS on volume change during cycling improves the cyclic stability. Consequently, the Fe single atom doped MoS2 quadruple-shelled sphere exhibits a high specific capacity of 213.3 mAh g-1 at an ultrahigh current density of 30 A g-1, which is superior to previously-reported results. Even at 5 A g-1, 259.4 mAh g-1 (83.68 %) was reserved after 500 cycles.

        "abstract": "Transition metal selenides (TMSs) are suitable for SIBs and PIBs owing to their satisfactory theoretical capacity and superior electrical conductivity. However, the large radius of Na+/K+ easily leads to sluggish kinetics and poor conductivity, which hinder the development of SIBs and PIBs. Structure design is an effective method to solve these obstacles. In this study, Co2+ ions combined with glycerol molecules to form self-assembled nanospheres at first, and then they were in situ converted into CoSe2 nanoparticles embedded in a carbon matrix during the selenization process. This structure has three-dimensional ion diffusion channels that can effectively hamper the aggregation of metal compound nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the CoSe2/C of the yolk-shell structure and a large number of pores help alleviate volume expansion and facilitate electrolyte wettability. These structural advantages of CoSe2/C endow it with remarkable electrochemical performances for full/half SIBs and full/half PIBs. The obtained CoSe2/C exhibits superior stability and excellent performance (312.1 mA h g-1 at 4 A g-1 after 1600 cycles) for SIBs. When it is used as an anode material for PIBs, 369.2 mA h g-1 can be retained after 200 cycles at 50 mA g-1 and 248.1 mA h g-1 can be retained after 200 cycles at 500 mA g-1; in addition, CoSe2/C also shows superior rate capacity (186.4 mA h g-1 at 1000 mA g-1). A series of ex situ XRD measurements were adapted to explore the possible conversion mechanism of CoSe2/C as the anode for PIBs. It is worth noting that the full-cell of CoSe2/C//Na3V2(PO4)3@rGO for SIBs and the full-cell of CoSe2/C//PTCDA-450 for PIBs were successfully assembled. The relationship between the structure and performance of CoSe2/C was investigated through density functional theory (DFT).",

        "abstract": "Uncontrollable dendrite growth and corrosion induced by reactive water molecules and sulfate ions (SO42-) seriously hindered the practical application of aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs). Here we construct artificial solid electrolyte interfaces (SEIs) realized by sodium and calcium bentonite with a layered structure anchored to anodes (NB@Zn and CB@Zn). This artificial SEI layer functioning as a protective coating to isolate activated water molecules, provides high-speed transport channels for Zn2+, and serves as an ionic sieve to repel negatively charged anions while attracting positively charged cations. The theoretical results show that the bentonite electrodes exhibit a higher binding energy for Zn2+. This demonstrates that the bentonite protective layer enhances the Zn-ion deposition kinetics. Consequently, the NB@Zn//MnO2 and CB@Zn//MnO2 full-battery capacities are 96.7 and 70.4 mAh g-1 at 2.0 A g-1 after 1000 cycles, respectively. This study aims to stabilize Zn anodes and improve the electrochemical performance of AZIBs by ion-selection sieving.",

        "abstract": "Metal chloride-intercalated graphite intercalation compounds (MC-GICs) show a perfect sandwich structure with high electronic conductivity and chemical stability, but there are few applications for MC-GICs in anode materials of sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we selected a splendid host microcrystalline graphite (MG) to synthesize an AlCl3 intercalated MG intercalation compound (AlCl3-MGIC) anode material and demonstrated that it is suitable for SIBs via electrolyte optimization. The AlCl3-MGIC electrode is primarily compared in four electrolytes. Sodium storage is proposed for co-intercalation and conversion reactions by simultaneously selecting a compatible NaPF6/diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME) electrolyte. As a result, the AlCl3-MGIC anode delivers a specific capacity of 202 mA h g-1 at a current density of 0.2 A g-1 after 100 cycles and still exhibits a satisfactory capacity of 198 mA h g-1 after 900 cycles. Density functional theory calculations further illustrate that DEGDME solvent molecules offer moderate adsorption energy to sodium ions that guarantees structure stabilization of GICs during repeated cycling. This work provides a theoretical basis for designing sodium ion storage with a graphite layered structure and unveiling the prospects of MC-GIC materials as high-performance anodes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are postulated as sustainable energy storage devices for light electromobility and stationary applications. The anode of choice in SIBs is hard carbon (HC) due to its electrochemical performance. Among different HC precursors, bio‐waste resources have attracted significant attention due to their low‐cost, abundance, and sustainability. Many bio‐waste materials have been used as HC precursors, but they often require strong acids/bases for pre‐/post‐treatment for HC development. Here, the morphology, microstructure, and electrochemical performance of HCs synthesized from hazelnut shells subjected to different pre‐treatments (i. e., no pre‐treatment, acid treatment, and water washing) were compared. The impact on the electrochemical performance of sodium‐ion cells and the cost‐effectiveness were also investigated. The results revealed that hazelnut shell‐derived HCs produced via simple water washing outperformed those obtained via other processing methods in terms of electrochemical performance and cost–ecological effectiveness of a sodium‐ion battery pack.",

One of the boosters for accelerating the practical application of sodium-ion batteries is the innovation in anode materials. This study focuses on developing a high-performance hard carbon anode material derived from hydroxymethylfurfural, produced from carbohydrates, using a straightforward thermal condensation method. The process results in a unique pseudo-graphitic material with abundant microporosity. Electrochemical evaluations demonstrate excellent sodium storage performance by maintaining the plateau capacity even at higher current densities. This translates to a promising energy density when coupled with the cathode material.

Tungsten disulfide (WS2 ) nanosheets are confined, through synergistic anchoring, on the surface and inside of hollow beaded carbon nanofibers (HB CNFs) via a hydrothermal reaction method to construct the hierarchical structure HB WS2 @CNFs. Benefiting from this unique advantage, HB WS2 @CNFs exhibits remarkable lithium-storage performance in terms of high rate capability (≈351 mAh g-1 at 2 A g-1 ) and stable long-term cycle (≈446 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 100 cycles). Moreover, as an anode material for SIBs, HB WS2 @CNFs obtains excellent long cycle life and rate performance. During the charging/discharging process, the evolution of morphology and composition of the composite are analyzed by a set of ex situ methods. This synergistic anchoring effect between WS2 nanosheets and HB CNFs is capable of effectively restraining volume expansion from the metal ions intercalation/deintercalation process and improving the cycling stability and rate performance in LIBs and SIBs.",

        "abstract": "As the most promising candidate for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the electrochemical performance of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is highly dependent on the electrode materials. Copper selenides have established themselves as potential anode materials for SIBs due to their high theoretical capacity and good conductivity. However, the poor rate performance and fast capacity fading are the major challenges to their practical application in SIBs. Herein, single-crystalline CuSe2 nanocubes (CuSe2 NCs) are successfully synthesized via a solvothermal method. As an anode of SIBs, the CuSe2 NCs render an almost 100% initial Coulombic efficiency, an outstanding long cycle life, e.g., 380 mA h g-1 after 1700 cycles at 10 A g-1, and an unprecedented rate performance of 344 mA h g-1 at 50 A g-1. Ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns reveal the crystalline transformation of energy-storage materials, and the density functional theory (DFT) conclusion suggests that fast and stable ion diffusion kinetics enhances their electrochemical performance upon sodiation/desodiaton.

In addition, our strategy involves three processes, a tunable organic polyreaction, a thermal annealing process, and a cost-effective reduction reaction.

Herein, hard carbons from a sustainable biomass feedstock (vine shoots) were synthesized via a simple two‐step carbonization process at different highest temperatures to be used as anodes in SIBs. The hard carbon produced at 1200 °C delivered the highest reversible capacity (270 mAh g–1 at 0.03 A g–1, with an acceptable initial coulombic efficiency of 71%) since a suitable balance between the pseudographitic domains growth and the retention of microporosity, defects, and functional groups was achieved. A prominent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 97% over 315 cycles was also attained. Comprehensive characterization unraveled a three‐stage sodium storage mechanism based on adsorption, intercalation, and filling of pores. A remarkable specific capacity underestimation of up to 38% was also found when a two‐electrode half‐cell configuration was employed to measure the rate performance. To avoid this systematic error caused by the counter/reference electrode polarization, we strongly recommend the use of a three‐electrode setup or a full‐cell configuration to correctly evaluate the anode response at moderate and high current rates.",

        "abstract": "Cost concerns have promoted the rise of Na-based batteries as an alternative to Li-based batteries, and the energy density pursuits have brought attention to Na metal anodes. Numerous studies have been conducted on the failure mechanisms and improvement methods of Na metal batteries (NMBs) at room temperature; however, the low-temperature applications are still faced with more complex challenges. On the basis of the concentration effect of the electrolytes, we propose a dilute electrolyte for the low-temperature operation of NMBs. With the low salt concentration and tetrahydrofuran cosolvent, the affinity between Na ions and the solvent molecules is weakened to achieve fast reaction kinetics at low temperatures. The designed electrolyte enables an effectively decreased cell impedance, which improves the cycling stability of Na symmetric cells. As a result, the full cell paired with the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode maintains a capacity of 80 mAh/g over 250 cycles at -20 °C.

Herein, an SnSe/FLG (few-layer graphene) composite with high tap density (2.3 g cm-3) is synthesized via plasma milling method, in which SnSe nanoparticles are strongly bound with the FLG matrix, owing to both Sn-C and Se-C bonds, to form nanosized primary particles and then assemble to microsized secondary granules. The FLG can effectively alleviate the large stress generated from volume expansion of SnSe during cycling, based on its superstrength. Furthermore, as demonstrated by the density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, the Sn-C and Se-C co-bonding benefitting from the formation of substantial vacancy defects on the P-milling synthesized FLG enables strong affinity between SnSe nanoparticles and FLG matrix, preventing SnSe from aggregating and detaching even after long-term cycling.

Nevertheless, the coarsening of the Sn nanoparticles impedes the reconversion back to SnO2, resulting in low coulombic efficiency and rapid capacity decay. In this study, we fabricated a heterostructure by combining SnO2 nanoparticles with MoS2 nanosheets via plasma‐assisted milling. The heterostructure consists of in‐situ exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets predominantly in 1 T phase, which tightly encase the SnO2 nanoparticles through strong bonding. This configuration effectively mitigates the volume change and particle aggregation upon cycling. Moreover, the strong affinity of Mo, which is the lithiation product of MoS2, toward Sn plays a pivotal role in inhibiting the coarsening of Sn nanograins, thus enhancing the reversibility of Sn to SnO2 upon cycling. Consequently, the SnO2/MoS2 heterostructure exhibits superb performance as an anode material for LIBs, demonstrating high capacity, rapid rate capability, and extended lifespan. Specifically, discharged/charged at a rate of 0.2 A g−1 for 300 cycles, it achieves a remarkable reversible capacity of 1173.4 mAh g−1. Even cycled at high rates of 1.0 and 5.0 A g−1 for 800 cycles, it still retains high reversible capacities of 1005.3 and 768.8 mAh g−1, respectively. Moreover, the heterostructure exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance in both full LIBs and sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "title": "Controllable Synthesis of Novel Orderly Layered VMoS2 Anode Materials with Super Electrochemical Performance for Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), being an attractive candidate of lithium-ion batteries, have attracted widespread attention as a result of sufficient sodium resource with low price and their comparable suitability in the field of energy storage. However, one of the main challenges for their wide-scale application is to develop suitable anode materials with excellent electrochemical performance. Herein, a novel orderly layered VMoS2 (OL-VMS) anode material was synthesized through a facile hydrothermal self-assembly approach followed by a heating procedure. As the anode material of the SIBs, the unique structure of OL-VMS not only facilitated the rapid migration of sodium ions between the stacked layers but also provided a stable framework for the volume change in the process of intercalation/deintercalation. In addition, vanadium mediating in the framework caused more defects to produce abundant storage sites for Na+. As such, the obtained OL-VMS-based anode exhibited high reversible capacities of 602.9 mAh g-1 at 0.2 mA g-1 and 534 mAh g-1 even after 190-cycle operation at 2 A g-1. Furthermore, the OL-VMS-based anode delivered an outstanding specific capacity of 626.4 mAh g-1 after 100-cycle testing at 2 A g-1 in a voltage range from 0.01 to 3 V. In particular, even in the absence of conductive carbon, it still showed an excellent specific capacity of 260 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 130 cycles in a 0.3-3 V voltage range, which should contribute to the cost reduction and energy density increase.",

        "abstract": "In this study, V5+ doped sodium titanate nanorods were successfully synthesized by a sol-gel method with different optimized vanadium concentrations. Before testing as a promising anode material for sodium ion battery (SIB) application, the samples were systematically characterized. It was clearly observed that V5+ doping significantly affects the phase formation of sodium titanate samples and leads to the alteration of the major phase of Na2Ti3O7 to a single Na2Ti6O13 phase with increasing doping concentrations. Electrochemical investigations clearly showed that the optimized 15 wt% V5+ doped sample exhibits the highest capacity of 136 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 900 cycles as well as better rate capability than the undoped sample by delivering 101 mA h g-1 capacity at a high current density of 1000 mA g-1. It is believed that the incorporation of highly charged V5+ in sodium titanate produces oxygen vacancies along with partial reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+, resulting in improved electronic conductivity. The utilization of oxygen vacancies also preserves the integrity of the electrode, giving rise to long term cycling. Thereby, V5+ doping was found to be an effective strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of the sodium titanate anode for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Inferior rate performance, insufficient cycle life, and low mass loading have restricted the practical application of hard carbon (HC) anodes in sodium-ion batteries (NIBs). Here, a compatible strategy is developed by matching HC anodes with an ether-based electrolyte. Systematical investigation reveals that good compatibility of the electrode-electrolyte systems forms thinner but a more sustainable solid-electrolyte interphase and delivers a higher ionic conductivity and Na+ ion diffusion coefficient than the commonly used ester-based electrolytes. Therefore, an excellent electrochemical performance is demonstrated with a long cycle life (∼196 mA h/g and 90% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 1 A/g), a super rate capability (∼51% capacity retention at 10 A/g) at a mass loading of 1.5 mg/cm2, and a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 85.9%. More importantly, a high reversible areal capacity of 4.3 mA h/cm2 can be achieved at an ultrahigh mass loading of 17 mg/cm2, superior to all reported HC anodes. Our findings not only shed light on the design of high-performance battery systems but also promise a commercial transformation from the lab test to mass production of NIBs.",

        "abstract": "Metal thiophosphite has demonstrated promising application potential as an anode material for sodium‐ion batteries. Nevertheless, the intrinsic low electrical conductivity and drastic volume expansion impede its commercialization. Herein, a series of metal thiophosphite/Ti3C2Tx (metal = Fe, Ni, Co, and Cd) composites are constructed via Lewis acidic molten salt etching followed by synchronous phospho‐sulfurization. The Ti3C2Tx substrate endows the thiophosphite/Ti3C2Tx hybrids with high electrical conductivity. Importantly, thiophosphite grown on the MXene layers exhibits a 3D cross‐linked structure, which not only facilitates electron/ion transport, but also maintains robust structural stability owing to the space confinement effect. As a proof of concept, FePS3/Ti3C2Tx demonstrates remarkable rate performance (827.4 and 598.1 mAh g−1 at 0.1 and 10 A g−1, respectively) along with long‐term cycling stability (capacity retention of 93.7% after 2000 cycles at 5 A g−1). Impressively, the FePS3/Ti3C2Tx//NVPO full cell exhibits a high reversible capacity of 396.8 mAh g−1 over 1350 cycles at 2 A g−1. The sodium storage mechanism of FePS3/Ti3C2Tx anode is further unveiled through in situ XRD/ex situ HRTEM characterizations and theoretical calculations.

        "abstract": "Porous Sn (PSn) has aroused extensive attention as an advanced anode for sodium‐ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity and small volume expansion. However, as a low‐melt metal, the preparation of PSn at room temperature is a difficult problem. Herein, universal chemical prelithiation/presodiation strategies are reported to rapidly synthesize PSn from commercial Sn powders at ambient temperature. The recyclable pre‐metallation solvents are selected by redox potential analysis to react with Sn to form alloy precursors in a short time. Benefiting from the application of delithiation/desodiation agents with suitable proton concentrations, PSn perfectly inherits the Sn skeleton from precursors. With this method, porous Al, Pb, Bi, and Sb are successfully produced. Finally, the half‐cell with PSn anode prepared by presodiation strategy achieves a great rate property (663 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1) and prominent cycling performance with 71% capacity retention after 7500 cycles (502 mAh g−1) at 5 A g−1.

A Coulombic efficiency of ≈99% is achieved after the third cycle. Increase of the C-rate leads to a drop of the capacity, but a full recovery is observed after switching back to the initial C-rate. In the early stages of Na uptake first Cu+ is reduced and expelled from the electrode as nanocrystalline metallic Cu. An increase of the Na content leads to a full conversion of the material with nanocrystalline Cu particles and elemental V embedded in a Na2S matrix. The formation of Na2S is evidenced by 23Na MAS NMR spectra and X-ray powder diffraction. During the charge process the nanocrystalline Cu particles are retained, but no crystalline materials are formed. At later stages of cycling the reaction mechanism changes which is accompanied by the formation of copper(I) sulfide. The presence of nanocrystalline metallic Cu and/or Cu2S improves the electrical conductivity, leading to superior cycling and rate capability.",

Here, sulfur-doped carbonized bacterial cellulose (S-CBC) was prepared as a high-performance anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) by simultaneous carbonization and sulfidation using the bacterial cellulose membrane produced by microbial fermentation as the precursor. Doping sublimed sulfur powder into CBC results in a greater degree of disorder and defects, buffering the volume expansion during the cycle. Significantly, the three-dimensional (3D) network structure of bacterial cellulose endows S-CBC with flexible self-support. As an anode for sodium ion batteries, S-CBC exhibits a high specific capacity of 302.9 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 50 cycles and 177.6 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1 after 1000 cycles. Compared with the CBC electrode, the S-CBC electrode also exhibits enhanced rate performance in sodium storage. Moreover, theoretical simulations reveal that Na+ has good adsorption stability and a faster diffusion rate in S-CBC. The doping of the S element introduces defects that enlarge the interlayer distance, and the synergies of adsorption and bonding are the main reasons for its high performance. These results indicate the potential application prospects of S-CBC as a flexible binder-free electrode for high-performance SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfides and oxides with high theoretical capacities have been regarded as promising anode candidates for a sodium-ion battery (SIB); however, they have critical issues including sluggish electrochemical kinetics and poor long-term stability. Herein, a dual carbon design strategy is proposed to integrate with highly active heterojunctions to overcome the above issues. In this new design, CoS2/CoO hollow dodecahedron heterojunctions are sandwiched between open framework carbon-spheres (OFCs) and a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanomembrane (OFC@CoS2/CoO@rGO). The CoS2/CoO heterojunctions effectively promote electron transfer on their surface and provide more electrochemical active sites through their hierarchical hollow structures assembled by nanodots. Meanwhile, the dual-carbon framework forms a highly conductive network that enables a better rate capability. More importantly, the dual carbon can greatly buffer volume expansion and stable reaction interfaces of electrode material during the charge/discharge process. Benefitting from their synergistical effects, the OFC@CoS2/CoO@rGO electrode achieves a high reversible capacity of 460 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 and still maintains 205.3 mAh g-1 even when current density is increased by 200 times when used as an anode material for SIBs. Their cycling property is also remarkable with a maintained capacity of 161 mAh g-1 after 3500 charging/discharging cycles at a high current density of 1 A g-1. The dual-carbon strategy is demonstrated to be effective for enhanced reaction kinetics and long-term cycling property, providing siginificant guidance for preparing other high-performance electrode materials.",

The highly reversible conversion of M/Na2S to pristine MS in charge plays a vital role with regard to the electrochemical performance. Here, taking conventional MoS2 as an example, guided by theoretical simulations, a catalyst of iron single atoms on nitrogen‐doped graphene (SAFe@NG) is selected and first used as a substrate to facilitate the reaction kinetics of MoS2 in the discharging process. In the following charging process, using a combination of spectroscopy and microscopy, it is demonstrated that the SAFe@NG catalyst enables an efficient reversible conversion reaction of Mo/Na2S→NaMoS2→MoS2. Moreover, theoretical simulations reveal that the reversible conversion mechanism shows favorable formation energy barrier and reaction kinetics, in which SAFe@NG with the Fe–N4 coordination center facilitates the uniform dispersion of Na2S/Mo and the decomposition of Na2S and NaMoS2. Therefore, efficient reversible conversion reaction MoS2↔NaMoS2↔Mo/Na2S is enabled by the SAFe@NG catalyst.

        "abstract": "Transition-metal sulfides hold great promise as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries due to the high theoretical capacity and excellent redox reversibility based on multielectron conversion reactions. In this work, an elaborate composite, cobalt sulfide nanoclusters embedded in honeycomb-like sulfur-doped carbon foam (Co9S8@S-CF), is prepared via a facile sulfur-assisting calcination strategy, which tactfully induces the co-occurrence of in situ pore-forming, sulfidation, sulfur doping, and carbonization. Notably, sulfur-doped carbon foam (S-CF) possesses abundant voids, which are subject to construction of three-dimensional ionic/electronic pathways, leading to high sodium-ion accessibility and ultrafast sodium-ion/electron transportation toward Co9S8 nanoclusters. When worked as an anode in sodium-ion batteries, it delivers a remarkable capacity of 373 mA h g-1 over 1000 cycles at 0.25 C, achieving superior capacity retention of 80%. Furthermore, this anode could achieve unprecedented rate capability with a reversible capacity of 180 mA h g-1 at 50 C (20 A g-1), which significantly precedes those reported previously.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfides (TMSs) have been extensively studied as electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries by virtue of their high theoretical capacity. However, the poor cyclability limits the practical application of TMSs in sodium ion batteries. In this study, N-rich carbon-coated Co3S4 ultrafine nanocrystal (Co3S4@NC) was prepared by utilizing ZIF-67 as a precursor through continuous carbonization and sulfuration processes, exhibiting ultrafine nanocrystals with a diameter of about 5 nm. When utilized as the anode for sodium ion batteries, the nanohybrid material exhibits remarkable cycling performance with a high specific capacity of 420.9 mA h g-1 at the current density of 100 mA g-1 after 100 cycles, indicating that the cycling performance is strengthened by the nitrogen-doped carbon coating. Impressively, the obtained material shows good rate performances with reversible specific capacities of 386.7, 284.0, and 151.2 mA h g-1 at 400, 1000, and 1400 mA g-1, respectively, due to the high surface-capacitance contribution and porous structure inherited from the precursor, which finally results in the increase in infiltration of electrolyte and the accelerating diffusion rate of Na+.

        "title": "N-doped carbon-coated ultrasmall Nb2O5 nanocomposite with excellent long cyclability for sodium storage.",
        "abstract": "Niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5) has drawn significant interest as a promising anode for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) due to its large interplanar lattice spacing and relatively high diffusion efficiency. However, the intrinsic drawbacks of low electrical conductivity and substantial volume change greatly impede its practical applications in large-scale energy storage systems. In this work, ultrasmall Nb2O5 nanoparticles wrapped with nitrogen-doped carbon (denoted as Nb2O5@NC) were delicately synthesized via a facile sol-gel method and subsequent heat treatment. The unique structure of ultrasmall Nb2O5 nanoparticles in a carbonaceous matrix can not only effectively shorten the transmission distance for both ions/electrons but also relieve the strain and stress caused by volume variation during the sodiation/desodiation process. In addition, the synergistic effect of nitrogen doping and carbon coating can further improve the electronic conductivity and pseudocapacitive behavior of the active materials, thus promoting the rapid electrochemical reaction kinetics of the Nb2O5@NC composite. The obtained 600-Nb2O5@NC-2 anode exhibits superior rate capability and outstanding cycling stability, delivering a reversible capacity of 196 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 1000 cycles. Even at high current densities of 5 A g-1 and 10 A g-1, the long-life cycling tests show that the reversible capacities still remain at 128.4 mA h g-1 and 95.9 mA h g-1 after 3000 cycles, respectively, which is the best performance of Nb2O5-based anodes at high current densities so far. These results indicate that the feasible synthetic strategy of Nb2O5@NC is an effective approach to develop high-performance Nb2O5-based anodes for large-scale energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are widely considered a hopeful alternative to lithium‐ion battery technology. However, they still face challenges, such as low rate capability, unsatisfactory cycling stability, and inferior variable‐temperature performance. In this study, a hierarchical Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) @reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/carbon nanotube (CNT) composite (NVPF@rGO/CNT) is successfully constructed. This composite features 0D Na3V2(PO4)2F3 nanoparticles are coated by a cross‐linked 3D conductive network composed of 2D rGO and 1D CNT. Furthermore, the intrinsic Na+ storage mechanism of NVPF@rGO/CNT through comprehensive characterizations is unveiled. The synthesized NVPF@rGO/CNT exhibits fast ionic/electronic transport and excellent structural stability within wide working temperatures (−40–50 °C), owing to the zero‐strain NVPF and the coated rGO/CNT conductive network that reduces diffusion distance for ions and electrons. Moreover, the stable integration between NVPF and rGO/CNT enables outstanding structural stability to alleviate strain and stress induced during the cycle. Additionally, a practice full cell is assembled employing a hard carbon anode paired with an NVPF@rGO/CNT cathode, which provides a decent capacity of 105.2 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C, thereby attaining an ideal energy density of 242.7 Wh kg−1.

Here, fabrication and characterization of high gravimetric and volumetric capacity 3D Ni-supported Sb2 O3 anodes for SIBs are presented. The electrodes are prepared by colloidal templating and pulsed electrodeposition followed by heat treatment. The colloidal template is optimized to provide large pore interconnects in the 3D scaffold to enable a high active materials loading and accommodate a large volume expansion during cycling. An electrodeposited loading of 1.1 g cm-3 is chosen to enable a combined high gravimetric and volumetric capacity. At this loading, the electrodes exhibit a specific capacity of ≈445 mA h g-1 and a volumetric capacity of ≈488 mA h cm-3 with a capacity retention of 89% after 200 cycles at 200 mA g-1 . The stable cycling performance can be attributed to the 3D metal scaffold, which supports active materials undergoing large volume changes, and an initial heat treatment appears to improve the adhesion of the Sb2 O3 to the metal scaffold.",

        "abstract": "It is still very urgent and challenging to simultaneously develop high‐rate and long‐cycle oxide cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) because of the sluggish kinetics and complex multiphase evolution during cycling. Here, the concept of accurately manipulating structural evolution and formulating high‐performance heterostructured biphasic layered oxide cathodes by local chemistry and orbital hybridization modulation is reported. The P2‐structure stoichiometric composition of the cathode material shows a layered P2‐ and O3‐type heterostructure that is explicitly evidenced by various macroscale and atomic‐scale techniques. Surprisingly, the heterostructured cathode displays excellent rate performance, remarkable cycling stability (capacity retention of 82.16% after 600 cycles at 2 C), and outstanding compatibility with hard carbon anode because of the integrated advantages of intergrowth structure and local environment regulation. Meanwhile, the formation process from precursors during calcination and the highly reversible dynamic structural evolution during the Na+ intercalation/deintercalation process are clearly articulated by a series of in situ characterization techniques. Also, the intrinsic structural properties and corresponding electrochemical behavior are further elucidated by the density of states and electron localization function of density functional theory calculations. Overall, this strategy, which finely tunes the local chemistry and orbitals hybridization for high‐performance SIBs, will open up a new field for other materials.",

        "abstract": "It is of fundamental and technological significance to develop dual‐role anode materials for both lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) with high performance. Here, a composite material based on CoSe2 nanoparticles encapsulated in N‐doped carbon framework intertwined with carbon nanotubes (CoSe2@N‐CF/CNTs) is prepared successfully from cobalt‐based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF‐67). As anode materials for LIBs, CoSe2@N‐CF/CNTs composites deliver a reversible capacity of 428 mAh g−1 even after 500 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1 with almost 100% Coulombic efficiency. The charge and discharge mechanisms of CoSe2 are characterized using ex situ X‐ray diffraction and Raman analysis, from which the lithiation products of CoSe2 are found to be LixCoSe2 and Li2Se, which are further converted to CoSe2 upon delithiation. The CoSe2@N‐CF/CNTs composites also demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance as anode materials for SIBs with a carbonate‐based electrolyte, with specific capacities of 606 and 501 mAh g−1 at 0.1 and 1 A g−1 in the 100th cycle. The electrochemical performance of the anode materials is further studied by pseudocapacitance and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurements.

        "abstract": "High-power sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) with long-term cycling attract increasing attention for large-scale energy storage. However, traditional SIBs toward practical applications still suffer from low rate capability and poor cycle induced by pulverization and amorphorization of anodes at high rate (over 5 C) during the fast ion insertion/extraction process. The present work demonstrates a robust strategy for a variety of (Sb-C, Bi-C, Sn-C, Ge-C, Sb-Bi-C) freestanding metal-carbon framework thin films via a space-confined superassembly (SCSA) strategy. The sodium-ion battery employing the Sb-C framework exhibits an unprecedented performance with a high specific capacity of 246 mAh g-1, long life cycle (5000 cycles), and superb capacity retention (almost 100%) at a high rate of 7.5 C (3.51A g-1). Further investigation indicates that the unique framework structure enables unusual reversible crystalline-phase transformation, guaranteeing the fast and long-cyclability sodium storage. This study may open an avenue to developing long-cycle-life and high-power SIBs for practical energy applications.",

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) possess the potential to realize low-cost and large-scale energy storage due to the abundance of sodium. However, the large ionic radius of sodium often leads to sluggish kinetics and large volume change, limiting the further development of SIBs. Layered MoS2, with a large interlayer distance, is a promising intercalation anode material for SIBs. In this work, we report the synthesis of methyl-functionalized MoS2 (M-MoS2) nanosheets through a facile second solvothermal method. During the second solvothermal treatment, the pristine MoS2 is mostly converted from the 2H to 1T phase and the interlayer distance is expanded from 0.65 to 0.80 nm. When evaluated as the anode for SIBs, the M-MoS2 exhibits superior cycling stability and rate capability. Kinetic analysis shows that the capacity is mainly contributed from a pseudocapacitive process. Ex situ XRD shows that the M-MoS2 exhibits inhibited lattice breathing and thus reduced volume change during cycling. This work demonstrates that the M-MoS2 is a promising candidate for pseudocapacitive sodium storage.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal chalcogenides have received great attention as promising anode candidates for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the undesirable cyclic life and inferior rate capability still restrict their practical applications. The design of micro-nano hierarchitectures is considered as a possible strategy to facilitate the electrochemical reaction kinetics and strengthen the electrode structure stability upon repeated Na+ insertion/extraction. Herein, urchin-like Fe3 Se4 hierarchitectures are successfully prepared and developed as a novel anode material for SIBs. Impressively, the as-prepared urchin-like Fe3 Se4 can present an ultrahigh rate capacity of 200.2 mAh g-1 at 30 A g-1 and a prominent capacity retention of 99.9% over 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1 , meanwhile, a respectable initial coulombic efficiency of ≈100% is achieved. Through the conjunct study of in situ X-ray diffraction, ex situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy, as well as cyclic voltammetry curves, it is intriguing to reveal that the phase transformation from monoclinic to amorphous structure accompanied by the pseudocapacitive Na+ storage behavior accounts for the superior electrochemical performance.

        "abstract": "2D transition metal carbides and nitrides, named MXenes, are attracting increasing attentions and showing competitive performance in energy storage devices including electrochemical capacitors, lithium‐ and sodium‐ion batteries, and lithium–sulfur batteries. However, similar to other 2D materials, MXene nanosheets are inclined to stack together, limiting the device performance. In order to fully utilize MXenes' electrochemical energy storage capability, here, processing of 2D MXene flakes into hollow spheres and 3D architectures via a template method is reported. The MXene hollow spheres are stable and can be easily dispersed in solvents such as water and ethanol, demonstrating their potential applications in environmental and biomedical fields as well. The 3D macroporous MXene films are free‐standing, flexible, and highly conductive due to good contacts between spheres and metallic conductivity of MXenes. When used as anodes for sodium‐ion storage, these 3D MXene films exhibit much improved performances compared to multilayer MXenes and MXene/carbon nanotube hybrid architectures in terms of capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability. This work demonstrates the importance of MXene electrode architecture on the electrochemical performance and can guide future work on designing high‐performance MXene‐based materials for energy storage, catalysis, environmental, and biomedical applications.",

        "abstract": "Developing non‐graphitic carbons with unique microstructure is a popular strategy to enhance the significant potential in practical applications of sodium‐ion batteries (SIB), while the electrochemical performance imbalances arising from their intricate active surface and porous structure pose significant challenges to its commercialization. Inspired by the structure of biological cell membranes, N/P co‐doped hard carbon nanospheres (NPCS) anodes with abundant ultramicropores (≈0.6 nm) are proposed and synthesized as robust sodium anodes. Based on density functional theory calculations, optimizing ultramicropores can enable small Na+ to be well confined within the pores and hinder large solvent molecules from invading and reacting, introducing N/P species contributes to the rapid adsorption/diffusion of Na+. In situ XRD and Raman analysis suggest that the nanoconfinement strategy induced by abundant ultramicropores and N/P co‐doping enables highly reversible electrochemical reactions. Electrochemical test confirms that the nanoconfinement strategy endows the NPCS anode with high reversible capacity (376.3 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1), superior initial coulombic efficiency (87.3% at 1.0 A g−1), remarkable rate capability (155.6 mAh g−1 at 50.0 A g−1) and excellent cycling stability (with capacity retention of ≈94.6% after 10 000 cycles), lightening a promising avenue for developing SIB with robust durability.",

To meet this challenge, herein, we first propose a redox-potential-matched chemical sodiation approach, utilizing phenazine-sodium (PNZ-Na) as the optimal reagent to sodiate the Na3V2(PO4)3 precursor into Na-enriched Na4V2(PO4)3. The spontaneous sodiation reaction enables a fast reduction of one-half V ions from V3+ to V2+, followed by the insertion of one Na+ ion into the NASICON framework, which only takes 90 s to obtain the phase-pure Na4V2(PO4)3 product. When paired with a hard carbon anode, the resulting Na4VP‖HC full cell exhibits a high energy density of 251 W h kg−1, which is 58% higher than that of 159 W h kg−1 for the Na3VP‖HC control cell. Our chemical sodiation methodology provides an innovative approach for designing sodium-rich cathode materials and could serve as an impetus to the development of advanced sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Carbon materials with large capacity and low potential serve as promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Carbon defects offer active sites for sodium storage but sacrifice reversibility, whereas carbon microcrystals improve conductivity but may suffer from low capacity. Herein, the balance between defects and microcrystals is realized by the molecular chemistry method of cross-linking and defect repairing. Real-time spectroscopic analyses reveal that the decomposition of tetrabromophthalic anhydride (TBPA) molecule induces the dehydrogenation of pitch to release small gas molecules to form pseudo-closed pores, followed by the cross-linking of C═O bonds in TBPA with the dehydrogenated pitch to form C─O─C bonds and thus suppress the excessive microcrystal growth. Meanwhile, the decomposition products of TBPA can also react with the dehydrogenated pitch to repair carbon defects. Thanks to the microstructure balance, the as-synthesized carbon material exhibits a smoother ion mass transfer channel (d(002) = 0.386 nm, La = 4.56 nm) and a larger storage space (Vpseudo-closed pore = 0.086 cm3 g-1) than the pitch carbon (PC, d(002) = 0.349 nm, La = 5.90 nm, Vpseudo-closed pore = 0.041 cm3 g-1), increasing the capacity from 162.5 to 336.5 mAh g-1.

This facile and cost-effective method is quite universal and holds potential to be further extended to other metal phosphide materials. Significantly, the hybrid nanosheet electrode possesses excellent sodium storage properties as anodes for SIBs, including high specific capacity, an ultra-long cycle life and a remarkable rate performance.

        "abstract": "Two new structural forms of Na xCo0.5Ti0.5O2, the layered O3- and P3-forms, were synthesized and comprehensively characterized. Both materials show electrochemical activity as electrodes in Na-ion batteries. During cell charging (desodiation of the Na xCo0.5Ti0.5O2 cathode), we observed a structural phase transformation of O3-Na0.95Co0.5Ti0.5O2 into P3-Na xCo0.5Ti0.5O2, whereas no changes other than conventional unit cell volume shrinkage were detected for P3-Na0.65Co0.5Ti0.5O2. During Na insertion (cell discharging), the reconversion of the P3-form into O3-Na xCo0.5Ti0.5O2 was impeded for both materials and occurs well below 1 V versus Na+/Na only. The reconversion is hindered by the charge and spin transfers of Co (LS-Co3+ → HS-Co2+) and by a significant unit cell volume expansion at the P3 → O3 transformation, as revealed from the magnetization, crystallographic, and spectroscopic studies. As the kinetics of such transformations depend on numerous parameters such as time, temperature, and particle size, a large cell overpotential ensues. An extended cutoff voltage at 0.2 V versus Na+/Na during discharging allows to complete the P3 → O3 transformation and increases the specific discharging capacity to 200 mA h g-1. Moreover, a quasi-symmetrical full cell, based on the O3- and P3-forms, was designed, eliminating safety concerns associated with sodium anodes and delivering a discharge capacity of 130 mA h g-1.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal phosphides have been extensively investigated owing to their high theoretical capacities and relatively low intercalation potentials vs Li/Li+, but their practical applications have been hindered by low electrical conductivity and dramatic volume variation during cycling. In this work, an interesting strategy for the rational design of graphene (GR) encapsulated with a hollow FeP@carbon nanocomposite (H-FeP@C@GR) via a combination of a hydrothermal route, a carbon-coating process, phosphidation treatment, and carbothermic reaction is reported. The hollow FeP (H-FeP) nanospheres shelled with thin carbon layers are wonderfully incorporated into the GR matrix, interconnecting to form a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical architecture. Such a design offers distinct advantages for FeP-based anode materials for both lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium ion batteries (SIBs). For example, the 3D omnibearing conductive networks from the GR skeleton and outer coating carbon can provide an open freeway for electron/ion transport, promoting the electrode reaction kinetics. In addition, the wrapping of an H-FeP nanosphere in a thin carbon layer enables the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the carbon layer surface instead of on the individual H-FeP surface, preventing the continual re-forming of the SEI. When used as anode materials for LIBs and SIBs, H-FeP@C@GR exhibited excellent electrochemistry performances.",

However, kinetic mismatches between fast capacitive charge storage on the cathode and sluggish battery-type reactions on the anode lead to a poor charge/discharge rate capability and insufficient power output of Na-ion capacitors. Thus, developing suitable anode materials for Na-ion capacitors is urgently desirable. This work demonstrates an electrochemically exfoliated graphite (EEG) anode with enhanced capacitive charge storage, greatly boosting the Na-ion reaction kinetics of co-intercalation. The EEG anode shows a high reversible capacity of 109 mAh g-1 and maintains a good capacity retention of 90% after 1000 cycles. The assembled Na-ion capacitor using the EEG anode can finish the charge/discharge process in less than 10 s, which achieves an ultrahigh power density of 17,500 W kg-1 with an energy density of 17 Wh kg-1.

        "abstract": "In comparison with lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been proposed as an alternative for large-scale energy storage. However, finding an anode material that can overcome the sluggish electrochemical reaction kinetics and fast capacity fading caused by large volume expansion during cycling is problematic. In this study, the intercalation technique for nitrogen-doped carbon layers is implemented for the molybdenum disulfide (MoS2/NC) structure to improve the rate and cycling stability of SIBs by increasing the diffusion rate of sodium ions and mitigating excessive volume structural expansion. The as-synthesized MoS2/NC anode has a high discharge specific capacity of 546 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 160 cycles, as well as a high rate and stable cycle performance of 406 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1 after 1000 cycles. Upon coupling with a high-voltage Na3V2(PO4)2O2F cathode, the sodium-ion full battery displays high specific energies of 78.57 W h kg-1 and 49.70 W h kg-1 at specific powers of 193.76 W kg-1 and 3756.80 W kg-1, respectively, with commercialization potential demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "The sodium ions battery (SIBs) has the potential to be the next generation rechargeable system that utilizes cheap and abundant sodium material. One of the key obstacles to sodium batteries is the lack of efficient and stable anode materials. Compared with traditional inorganic electrode materials, organic materials are more attractive because of their easier sodium transport accessibility and the diversities of organic frameworks and functional groups. In this work, two molecules (Na-CPN and Na-CPP) were synthesized and used as anode materials for SIBs. Structurally, the two compounds are isomers, and they are distinguished by the position of N atoms in phenylpyridine. Na-CPP provides a high reversible capacity of 197 mAh g -1 , excitingly, its capacity could maintain 99.1% even after 350 cycles of 100 mA g -1 . Moreover, after going through 1200 cycles at a current density of 5C, the Na-CPP electrode still retain a capacity rate of 89.9%. These results are impressive. In contrast, Na-CPN exhibited inferior capacity performance and rate performance for its larger polarization, particle size and charge transporting resistance.",

        "abstract": "2D transitional metal selenide heterostructures are promising electrode materials for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) owing to the large surface area, high mechanical strength, and short diffusion pathways. However, the cycling performance remains a significant challenge, particularly concerning the electrochemical conversion reaction. Herein, 2D Se-rich ZnSe/CoSe2@C heterostructured composite is fabricated via a convenient hydrothermal approach followed by selenization process, and then applied as high-performance anodes for PIBs. For example, the capacity delivered by the heterostructured composite is mainly contributed to the synergistic effect of conversion and alloy/de-alloy processes aroused by K+, where K+ may highly insert or de-insert into Se-rich ZnSe/CoSe2@C. The obtained electrode delivers an outstanding reversible charge capacity of 214 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 4000 cycles for PIBs, and achieves 262 mAh g-1 when coupled with a PTCDA cathode in the full cell. The electrochemical conversion mechanism of the optimized electrode during cycling is investigated through in situ XRD, Raman, and ex situ HRTEM. In addition, the heterostructured composite as anodes also displays excellent electrochemical performances for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).

        "abstract": "Solid electrolytes (SE) have attracted a great deal of interest as they can not only mitigate the safety issues related to currently used liquid organic electrolytes but also enable the introduction of a metallic Na anode with extreme energy density in sodium-ion batteries. For such application, SE should exhibit high interfacial stability against metallic Na as well as high ionic conductivity, and Na6SOI2 with a Na-rich double anti-perovskite structure was recently identified as a promising SE candidate. In this work, we performed first principles calculations to investigate the structural and electrochemical properties of the interface between Na6SOI2 and a metallic Na anode. Our calculations revealed that interfaces could be formed safely, keeping the ultra-fast ionic conductivity of the bulk phase near the interface. Through the electronic structure analysis of the interface models, we found the change of upward valence band bending at the surface to downward band bending at the interface, being accompanied by electronic charge transfer from a metallic Na anode to Na6SOI2 SE at the interface. This work provides valuable atomistic insight into the formation and properties of the interface between SE and alkali metal for enhancing battery performance.",

A high reversible capacity of 245.6 mA h g-1 is maintained at 0.1 A g-1 after 200 cycles, and a high specific capacity of 155.6 mA h g-1 is achieved at a high rate of 5.0 A g-1.

        "abstract": "Interface stability is a key to practical applications of high‐rate sodium metal batteries (SMBs). The general sodium metal anode (SMA), for example, suffers from an unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI), which may induce severe dendrite growth and continuous Na consumption, particularly under high rates. At the same time, the cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) of a widely adopted cathode material Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) has to tolerate the massive volume changes during the rapid Na+ ion intercalation/extraction, resulting in structural degradations and the capacity loss. Here, a facile strategy is reported by introducing aluminum ethoxide to a conventional ether‐based electrolyte, to promote the formation of an alumina‐rich SEI and CEI, which facilitates the rapid Na+ ion transport across the interface and promotes the uniform Na deposition. The resultant Na || Na symmetric cell demonstrates a stable cycling of 4800 h at 10 mA cm−2 and 1 mAh cm−2, and a Na || NVP full cell exhibits a high capacity retention of 81.28% after 6000 cycles at 40C.

However, attaining long‐term stability and high‐capacity performance of SIBs at ultrahigh rates remains a significant challenge due to the large ionic radius and slow kinetic behavior of Na+. Herein, a novel robust anode with a dual‐biomimetic gradient hierarchical architecture is proposed and provide a simple strategy to fabricate this sulfur‐doped mesoporous carbon concave hollow sphere/Ti3C2Tx MXene (SCMX) anode. In addition, Cu2S nanoparticles are in situ embedded into the SCMX architecture by electrochemical induction during the cycling process to act as active sites, which enhances the rate performance and cycling stability. Relying on its hybrid architecture and in situ formed Cu2S, this SCMX anode can achieve high ion accessibility, rich active sites, rapid charge transfer, and favorable structure stability, as disclosed by in/ex situ characterizations. As a result, it exhibits high reversible capacity (745.6 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1), ultrahigh‐rate capability (380.5 mAh g−1 at 50.0 A g−1), and long cycling stability (98.2% capacity retention after 10 000 cycles at 80.0 A g−1).

Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal the significantly enhanced reaction kinetics of Sb and nitrogen‐doped graphene by multi‐physics field coupling.

Mixed with graphene upon electrode preparation, this Ga2S3 electrode maintains a reversible specific capacity of 476 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.4 A g-1, with a coulombic efficiency of over 99%. Ex situ XRD analysis and theoretical calculations are employed to comprehensively elucidate the detailed sodium ion storage mechanism of Ga2S3, which is composed of initial Na+ intercalation, a subsequent multi-step conversion reaction between S and Na+, and an eventual alloying reaction between Ga and Na+ with the end product of Na7Ga13. Further kinetics analysis has demonstrated that the conversion reaction is the rate-limiting step due to a multi-step reaction with the intermediate phase of GaS. Moreover, the appearance of liquid metal Ga, as confirmed via TEM observations and theoretical calculations, can serve as a self-healing agent that repairs cracks in the electrode.

        "title": "Lignin‐derived hard carbon anode with a robust solid electrolyte interphase for boosted sodium storage performance",
        "abstract": "Hard carbon is regarded as a promising anode candidate for sodium‐ion batteries due to its low cost, relatively low working voltage, and satisfactory specific capacity. However, it still remains a challenge to obtain a high‐performance hard carbon anode from cost‐effective carbon sources. In addition, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is subjected to continuous rupture during battery cycling, leading to fast capacity decay. Herein, a lignin‐based hard carbon with robust SEI is developed to address these issues, effectively killing two birds with one stone. An innovative gas‐phase removal‐assisted aqueous washing strategy is developed to remove excessive sodium in the precursor to upcycle industrial lignin into high‐value hard carbon, which demonstrated an ultrahigh sodium storage capacity of 359 mAh g−1. It is found that the residual sodium components from lignin on hard carbon act as active sites that controllably regulate the composition and morphology of SEI and guide homogeneous SEI growth by a near‐shore aggregation mechanism to form thin, dense, and organic‐rich SEI. Benefiting from these merits, the as‐developed SEI shows fast Na+ transfer at the interphases and enhanced structural stability, thus preventing SEI rupture and reformation, and ultimately leading to a comprehensive improvement in sodium storage performance.",

        "title": "Composite Quasi‐Solid‐State Electrolytes with Organic–Inorganic Interface Engineering for Fast Ion Transport in Dendrite‐Free Sodium Metal Batteries",
        "abstract": "Quasi‐solid‐state electrolytes (QSSE) are a promising candidate for addressing the limitations of liquid and solid electrolytes. However, different ion transport capacities between liquid solvents and polymers can cause localized heterogeneous distribution of Na+ fluxes. In addition, the continuous side reactions occurring at the interface between QSSE and sodium anode lead to uncontrollable dendrites growth. Herein, a novel strategy is designed to integrate the composite electrospun membrane of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 and poly(vinylidene fluoride‐co‐hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF‐HFP) into QSSE, aiming to introduce new fast ion conducting channels at the organic–inorganic interface. The efficient ion transfer pathways can effectively promote the homogenization of ion migration, enabling composite QSSE to achieve an ultrahigh ionic conductivity of 4.1 mS cm−1 at room temperature, with a Na+ transference number as high as 0.54. Moreover, the PVDF‐HFP is preferentially reduced upon contact with the sodium anode to form a “NaF‐rich” solid electrolyte interphase, which effectively suppresses the growth of dendrites. The synergistic combination of multiple strategies can realize exceptional long‐term cycling stability in both sodium symmetric batteries (≈700 h) and full batteries (2100 cycles). This study provides a new insight for constructing high performance and dendrite‐free solid‐state sodium metal batteries.",

        "title": "Revealing Electrochemical Process of Functional Carbon Dots Stabilized Sodium Metal Anode: Co‐Deposition and Strengthened SEI Films",
        "abstract": "Sodium metal batteries with high theoretical energy density and low redox potential possess vast application prospects. However, the inevitable side reactions between Na metal anode and electrolyte, the formation of Na dendrite during cycling, and the uneven electric field distribution at the interface will lead to a decrease in the cycling stability of the battery. Herein, N and S co‐doped carbon dots are employed as electrolyte additives in view of their quantum size, excellent dispersion, and polar surface functional groups. It is found that the quantum‐sized carbon core and sodiophilic surface functional groups of N,S‐CDs enable the homogenous deposition of Na+ and the involvement of N,S‐CDs in the formation of solid electrolyte film. The N,S‐CDs co‐deposition guarantees the uniform sodium plating in the initial cycle, avoiding the routine dendrite growth. The strength and stability of SEI are boosted with the assistance of inorganics such as Na3N and Na2S, which accelerate the transport of Na+ flux and realize rapid charge transfer at the interface, ensuring high reversibility of sodium ion plating/stripping. Na||Cu half‐cells achieve a coulombic efficiency of 99% after 250 cycles under 1.0 mA cm−1, and Na||Na symmetric cells continuously cycle over 1200 h at a current density of 1 mA cm−2.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, sodium‐ion batteries are considered the most promising large‐scale energy storage systems (EESs) due to the low cost and wide distribution of sodium sources as well as the similar working principle to lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs). Therefore, screening suitable materials with high abundance, low cost, and excellent reliability and modified with different strategies based on them is the key point for the development of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). In addition, the ideal anodes with high abundance, and low cost elements also greatly influence the cost of SIB systems, determining the large‐scale application. Herein, recent advances in carbon, iron, manganese, and phosphorus‐based anodes of various types, such as hard carbon, iron oxides, manganese oxides, and red phosphorus, are highlighted. The various sodium storage mechanisms and structure‐function properties for these four types of materials are summarized and analyzed in detail. Considering the commercial profits that the EESs can bring and their suitability for mass electrode manufacturing, the participation of high‐abundance and low‐cost elements such as Fe, Mn, C, and P is convincing and encouraging.",

        "abstract": "The sodium (Na)‐metal anode with high theoretical capacity and low cost is promising for construction of high‐energy‐density metal batteries. However, the unsatisfactory interface between Na and the liquid electrolyte induces tardy ion transfer kinetics and dendritic Na growth, especially at ultralow temperature (−40 °C). Herein, an artificial heterogeneous interphase consisting of disodium selenide (Na2Se) and metal vanadium (V) is produced on the surface of Na (Na@Na2Se/V) via an in situ spontaneous chemical reaction. Such interphase layer possesses high sodiophilicity, excellent ionic conductivity, and high Young's modulus, which can promote Na‐ion adsorption and transport, realizing homogenous Na deposition without dendrites. The symmetric Na@Na2Se/V cell exhibits outstanding cycling life span of over 1790 h (0.5 mA cm−2/1 mAh cm−2) in carbonate‐based electrolyte. More remarkably, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the artificial Na2Se/V hybrid interphase can accelerate the desolvation of solvated Na+ at −40 °C. The Na@Na2Se/V electrode thus exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance in symmetric cell (over 1500 h at 0.5 mA cm−2/0.5 mAh cm−2) and full cell (over 700 cycles at 0.5 C) at −40 °C.

        "abstract": "The prospects of sodium (Na) metal batteries have been fatally plagued by interfacial Na dendrites, mainly affected by preferred nucleation on the metal anode and the steep gradient of Na ions in the electrolyte, leading to limited Coulombic efficiency and short lifespans. Herein, an electrochemically inert potassium-based Na-K alloy demonstrates a liquid alloying diffusion mechanism that enables dendrite-free Na anodes. The extremely small Na fluctuation and flexible Na-K bonds in the liquid alloy phase bring isotropic nucleation of Na upon electroplating/stripping, which is directly observed by in situ optical imaging. Spontaneously, serving as (de)sodiation buffer with faster electron/mass transportation, the liquid inertia also provides attenuated concentration distribution of Na. Significantly, a record capacity retention of approximately 100% is rendered when coupled with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathodes (ca. 2 mg cm-2) over 500 cycles at 10C, advancing the possibility of using liquid alloy for stable metal anodes beyond Na storage systems.",

The composite (donated as N-PB@CMK) has high electrical conductivity, low resistance, and ultrahigh specific surface, which can lead to high capacitive contribution ratios. The N-PB@CMK electrode can deliver a discharge capacity of 120 mAh g-1 and maintain retention of 85.0% after cycling for 200 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g-1. Even cycling at 1 A g-1, the reversible capacity can be measured to 102 mAh g-1 and exhibit stability over a long cycle. In situ Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were further measured to illustrate the phase transition of crystal structure along with the extraction/insertion processes of Na+ ions. Especially, the assembled full cell with NaTi2(PO4)3@C anode can also show good stability and provide promising insights of applying the N-PB@CMK for energy storage systems in the future.",

A simple and energy efficient strategy to develop electrodes for SIBs with a high charge/discharge rate is highly desirable.

This is due to the formation of GexSb1-x at the surface leading to better diffusion of Na, and the formation of a stable twin organic and inorganic SEI which protects the electrode. By judicious control of the surface modification, an improvement in the capacity to between 50% and 300% has been achieved at high current densities (0.83-8.4 A g(-1)) in an ionic liquid electrolyte NaFSI-[Py1,4]FSI.

        "abstract": "A new deposition mechanism is presented in this study to achieve highly reversible plating and stripping of magnesium (Mg) anodes for Mg-ion batteries. It is known that the reduction of electrolyte anions such as bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI-) causes Mg surface passivation, resulting in poor electrochemical performance for Mg-ion batteries. We reveal that the addition of sodium cations (Na+) in Mg-ion electrolytes can fundamentally alter the interfacial chemistry and structure at the Mg anode surface. The molecular dynamics simulation suggests that Na+ cations contribute to a significant population in the interfacial double layer so that TFSI- anions are excluded from the immediate interface adjacent to the Mg anode. As a result, the TFSI- decomposition is largely suppressed so does the formation of passivation layers at the Mg surface. This mechanism is supported by our electrochemical, microscopic, and spectroscopic analyses. The resultant Mg deposition demonstrates smooth surface morphology and lowered overpotential compared to the pure Mg(TFSI)2 electrolyte.",

Here, we present a self-template and in-situ synchronous selenization/vulcanization strategy for the synthesis of flowerlike hierarchical MoS0.74Se1.26/N-doped carbon (MoS0.74Se1.26/NC) microspheres by morphology-preserved thermal transformation of Mo-polydopamine precursor. Introducing element S into MoSe2 crystal structure can enhance the electron and ion transportation and lift the ability of MoSe2 to store Na+; the presence of Se can expand the interlayer spacing in contrast to MoS2. Moreover, carbon composition can also favor the electrical conductivity and the rigid micro/nanostructure is better for preventing the stacking of MoS0.74Se1.26 nanoflakes. The Mo-polydopamine-derived MoS0.74Se1.26/NC hybrid exhibits much better performance as the sodium-ion battery (SIB) anode than MoS2/NC and MoSe2/NC counterparts, confirming that the advanced electrode material can be attained via the rationalization of the synthetic method.

However, their service life, especially at high specific density, is hindered by the undesirable reversibility of metal anodes, owing to the inhomogeneous ion distribution and awkward charge transfer dynamics at the electrode/electrolyte interface. In this work, it is well demonstrated that ferroelectric phase BaTiO3 reinforced Na3 Zr2 Si2 PO12 ceramic electrolyte can deconcentrate the distribution of charge transfer and self-accelerate Na+ migration at the Na/Na3 Zr2 Si2 PO12 interface upon cycling, realizing a compact Na deposition morphology together with a high critical current density (1.05 mA cm-2 at ambient conditions).

We have investigated the relative performance of novel intrinsically metallic h-BSi3 (BS) sheet as an anode for SIBs, compared to LIBs, through Density Functional Theory studies. Our calculations show that BS has higher chemisorption interactions with Na than Li atoms while drawing substantial electron densities from both, turning them into cations. BS is able to reach a high specific capacity of 1127.62 mA h g-1 for Na, while only as half of that for Li, at ambient temperatures ranging 300-600 K. The moderate sodiation (0.77 V) and lithiation (0.79 V) voltages facilitate BS to prevent the SEI layer formation, metal plating and harmful dendrite growth and to maintain good energy density. BS retains good electronic and ionic conductivities after hosting both Na and Li adatoms, while the former diffuses with about as half the barriers as those of the latter, supporting faster charge/discharge rate and greater preservation of storage capacities in high current densities when BS is used as an anode in SIBs. Na adsorptions cause relatively lower structural deformations to BS, and refrain from forming clusters, leading to good cyclic stability.

Even at 0.5 A g-1, the specific capacity of the second cycle is 432.99 mAh g-1, which still keeps 400.9 mAh g-1 after 800 cycles, with a retention rate of 92.5%. The excellent cycle stability is mainly attributed to the uniform distribution of small Bi2S3 nanoparticles in CNFs providing abundant active sites, preventing side reactions, relieving volume expansion, improving the electrical conductivity, and accelerating the electrochemical reaction kinetics.",

        "abstract": "Titanates have been widely reported as anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, their wide temperature suitability and cycle life remain fundamental issues that hinder their practical application. Herein, a novel hollow Na2Ti3O7 microsphere (H‐NTO) with a unique chemically bonded NTO/C(N) interface is reported. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the NTO/C(N) interface stabilizes the crystal structure, and the optimized interface enables the H‐NTO anode to stably operate for 80 000 cycles in a conventional ester electrolyte with negligible capacity loss. Optimizing the electrolyte allows the H‐NTO electrode to cycle stably for 200 calendar days without capacity degradation at −40 °C. The excellent cycling stability is attributed to the NTO/C(N) interface and the stable solid electrolyte interphase formed by the highly adaptable electrolyte/electrode interface. Titanate exhibits solvent co‐intercalation behavior in ether‐based electrolytes, and its robust structure ensures that it can adapt to large volume changes at low temperatures. This study provides a unique perspective on the long‐cycle mechanism of titanate anodes and highlights the critical importance of manipulating the interfacial chemistry in SIBs, including the material and electrode/electrolyte interfaces.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted great interest for large‐scale electric energy storage in recent years. However, anodes with long cycle life and large reversible capacities are still lacking and therefore limiting the development of SIBs. Here, a bulk Bi anode with surprisingly high Na storage performance in combination with glyme‐based electrolytes is reported. This study shows that the bulk Bi electrode is gradually developed into a porous integrity during initial cycling, which is totally different from that in carbonate‐based electrolytes and ensures facile Na+ transport and structural stability. The achievable capacity of bulk Bi in the NaPF6‐diglyme electrolyte is high up to 400 mAh g−1, and the capacity retention is 94.4% after 2000 cycles, corresponding to a capacity loss of 0.0028% per cycle. It exhibits two flat discharge/charge plateaus at 0.67/0.77 and 0.46/0.64 V, ascribed to the typical two‐phase reactions of Bi ↔ NaBi and NaBi ↔ Na3Bi, respectively. The excellent performance is attributed to the unique porous integrity, stable solid electrolyte interface, and good electrode wettability of glymes. This interplay between electrolyte and electrode to boost Na storage performance will pave a new pathway for high‐performance SIBs.",

After chemical treatment with NaOH and H2SO4, the impurity content in the raw material decreased significantly (e.g., ash content dropped from 4.4% to 0.9%, etc.). The interspacing between the graphene layers in the anthracite structure also increased after the heat treatment. Besides, on extending the heating time, the anthracite structure became more disordered than the samples heated for shorter times. Therefore, the intercalation ability of Na+ ions in the anthracite structure increased, and the sample heated at 900 °C for 6 hours exhibited the highest reversible capacity of up to 160 mA h g−1 with adequate capacity retention after 100 cycles at C/10 rate.",

        "abstract": "The lithium and sodium storage performances of SnS anode often undergo rapid capacity decay and poor rate capability owing to its huge volume fluctuation and structural instability upon the repeated charge/discharge processes. Herein, a novel and versatile method is described for in situ synthesis of ultrathin SnS nanosheets inside and outside hollow mesoporous carbon spheres crosslinked reduced graphene oxide networks. Thus, 3D honeycomb-like network architecture is formed. Systematic electrochemical studies manifest that this nanocomposite as anode material for lithium-ion batteries delivers a high charge capacity of 1027 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 100 cycles. Meanwhile, the as-developed nanocomposite still retains a charge capacity of 524 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles for sodium-ion batteries. In addition, the electrochemical kinetics analysis verifies the basic principles of enhanced rate capacity. The appealing electrochemical performance for both lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries can be mainly related to the porous 3D interconnected architecture, in which the nanoscale SnS nanosheets not only offer decreased ion diffusion pathways and fast Li+ /Na+ transport kinetics, but also the 3D interconnected conductive networks constructed from the hollow mesoporous carbon spheres and reduced graphene oxide enhance the conductivity and ensure the structural integrity.",

This study proposes a novel conversion reaction using CoSnO3 (CSO) nanocubes uniformly wrapped in graphene nanosheets, which are fabricated using a wet-chemical strategy followed by low-temperature heat treatment. This optimized composite exhibits durable cyclability and high-rate capability, attributing to the strong interaction between reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and CSO through its surface oxygen moieties. It develops a facile conversion reaction route, thereby leading to SnO2 formation during charging. This interactive phenomenon further contributes to improving the reaction kinetics and restraining the volume expansion during cycling.

The thermodynamic and kinetic stability of monolayer MBenes at room temperature was confirmed by AIMD simulations and phonon spectra. We investigated the potential of two-dimensional MBenes (V, Cr, Mn) as lithium/sodium ion anode electrode materials. Research shows that MBenes have inherent metallic properties, and their mechanical properties indicate that MBenes have high Young's modulus and anisotropy, low diffusion potential and low open-circuit voltage, with outstanding rate performance and good chemical stability in practical applications. In addition, functionalization tends to strongly reduce electrochemical performance and should be avoided as much as possible in experiments. These interesting findings fully demonstrate that the predicted monolayer MBenes are attractive anode materials for lithium/sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Numerous studies have reported that the enhancement of rate capability of carbonaceous anode by heteroatom doping is due to the increased diffusion‐controlled capacity induced by expanding interlayer spacing. However, percentage of diffusion‐controlled capacity is less than 30% as scan rate is larger than 1 mV s−1, suggesting there is inaccuracy in recognizing principle of improving rate capability of carbonaceous anode. In this paper, it is found that the heteroatom doping has little impact on interlayer spacing of carbon in bulk phase, meaning that diffusion‐controlled capacity is hard to be enhanced by doping. After synergizing with tensile stress, however, the interlayer spacing in subsurface region is obviously expanded to 0.40 nm, which will increase the thickness of accessible subsurface region at high current density. So SRNDC‐700 electrodes display a high specific capacity of 160.6 and 69.5 mAh g−1 at 20 and 50 A g−1, respectively. Additionally, the high reversibility of carbon structure insures ultralong cycling stability and hence attenuation of SRNDC‐700 is only 0.0025% per cycle even at 10 A g−1 for 6000 cycles. This report sheds new insight into mechanism of improving electrochemical performance of carbonaceous anode by doping and provides a novel design concept for doping carbon.",

In the current study, we adopt finite element simulation to guide the rational design of nanostructures. By calculating the von Mises stress distribution of a series of carbon materials, we find that the hollow biconcave structure could effectively alleviate the stress concentration resulting from expansion. Accordingly, we propose a biconcave-alleviated strategy based on the Aspergillus niger-derived carbon (ANDC) to construct ANDC/MoS2 with a hollow biconcave structure. The ANDC/MoS2 is endowed with an excellent long-term cyclability as an anode of sodium ion batteries, delivering a discharge capacity of 496 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1. A capacity retention rate of 94.5% is achieved, an increase of almost seven times compared with the bare MoS2 nanosheets. Even at a high current density of 5 A g-1, a reversible discharge capacity around 400 mAh g-1 is maintained after 300 cycles. ANDC/MoS2 could also be used for efficient lithium storage. By using in situ TEM, we further reveal that the hollow biconcave structure of ANDC/MoS2 has enabled stable and fast sodiation/desodiation.",

        "abstract": "The low-cost and profusion of sodium reserves make Na-ion batteries (NIBs) a potential candidate to lithium-ion batteries for grid-scale energy storage applications. NaVOPO4 has been recognized as one of the most promising cathodes for high-energy NIBs, owing to their high theoretical capacity and energy density. However, their further application is hindered by the multiphase transition and conductivity confinement. Herein, we proposed a feasible, one-step hydrothermal synthesis to regulate the synthesis of α-NaVOPO4 with controlled morphologies. The electrochemical properties of the NaVOPO4 electrode can be significantly enhanced taking Ketjen black (KB) as the optimized conductive carbon. Besides, combining with the nanocrystallization and construction of the conductive framework via high-energy ball milling, taking KB as the conductive carbon, the as-prepared NaVOPO4/5%KB exhibits superior Na-storage performance (140.2 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C and a capacity retention of 84.8% over 1000 cycles at 10 C) to the original NaVOPO4 (128.5 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C and a capacity retention of 83.1% over 1000 cycles at 10 C). Moreover, the aqueous full cell with NaTi2(PO4)3 as the anode delivers a capacity of 114.7 mA h g-1 at 0.2 C (141 W h kg-1 energy density) and 80.6% capacity retention over 300 cycles at 5 C. The excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the nanosized structural and enhanced interfacial effect, which could be rewarding to construct electron transportation tunnels, thus speeding up the Na+-diffusion kinetics. The modified strategy provides an efficient approach to intensify the electrochemical performance, which exhibits potential application of the NaVOPO4 cathode for NIBs.",

The structure of the synthesised materials was characterised using powder X-ray diffraction, which confirms the formation of a mixed Na2Ti3O7 and Na2Ti6O13 phase, with majority Na2Ti3O7 phase, in contrast to previous synthesis methods. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy analysis reveals a rod morphology, with an average diameter and length of 87 nm ± 3 nm and 1.37 μm ± 0.07 μm, respectively. The initial discharge and charge capacity of Na2Ti3O7 nanorods were measured as 325.20 mA h g-1 and 149.07 mA h g-1, respectively, at 10 mA g-1 between 0.01-2.5 V. We attribute the enhanced performance to the higher weight fraction of Na2Ti3O7 phase vs. previous reports, demonstrating the potential of the ionic liquid method when applied to sodium titanate materials.",

        "abstract": "Developing efficient anode materials with a good electrochemical performance has been a key scientific issue in the development of sodium ion batteries (SIBs). In this work, by means of density functional theory (DFT) computations, we demonstrate that two-dimensional (2D) Ti2PTe2 monolayer is a promising candidate for this application. The exfoliation of Ti2PTe2 monolayer from its experimentally known layered bulk phase is feasible due to the moderate cohesive energy. Different from many binary 2D transitions metal chalcogenides (TMCs) that are semiconducting, Ti2PTe2 monolayer is metallic with considerable electronic states at the Fermi level. Remarkably, Ti2PTe2 monolayer has a considerably high theoretical capacity of 280.72 mA h g−1, a rather small Na diffusion barrier of 0.22 eV, and a low average open circuit voltage of 0.31 eV. These results suggest that Ti2PTe2 monolayer can be utilized as a promising anode material for SIBs with high power density and fast charge/discharge rates.",

        "abstract": "Solvent molecule tuning is used to alter the redox potentials of solvents or ion‐solvent binding energy for high‐voltage or low‐temperature electrolytes. Herein, an electrolyte design strategy that effectively suppresses solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) dissolution and passivates highly‐reactive metallic Na anode via solvent molecule tuning is proposed. With rationally lengthened phosphate backbones with ─CH2─ units, the low‐solvation tris(2‐ethylhexyl) phosphate (TOP) molecule effectively weakens the solvation ability of carbonate‐based electrolytes, reduces the free solvent ratio, and enables an anion‐enriched primary Na+ ion solvation sheath. The decreased free solvent and compact lower‐solubility interphase established in this electrolyte prevent electrodes from continuous SEI dissolution and parasitic reactions at both room temperature (RT) and high temperature (HT). As a result, the Na/Na3V2(PO4)3 cell with the new electrolyte achieves impressive cycling stability of 95.7% capacity retention after 1800 cycles at 25 °C and 62.1% capacity retention after 700 cycles at 60 °C. Moreover, the TOP molecule not only maintains the nonflammable feature of phosphate but also attains higher thermal stability, which endows the electrolyte with high safety and thermal stability. This design concept for electrolytes offers a promising path to long‐cycling and high‐safety sodium metal batteries.",

Inspired by cream rolls in our daily life, a MnS/N,S-co-doped carbon tube (MnS/NSCT) composite with a 3D cross-linked tubular structure is prepared via an ultra-simple and low-cost method in this work. As the anode for SIBs, the cream roll-like MnS/NSCT composite has delivered the best electrochemical performance to date (the highest capacity of 550.6 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1, the highest capacity of 447.0 mA h g-1 after 1400 cycles at 1000 mA g-1, and the best rate performance of 319.8 mA h g-1 at 10 000 mA g-1). Besides, according to several in situ and ex situ techniques, the sodium storage mechanism of MnS/NSCTs is mainly from a conversion reaction, and the superior electrochemical performance of MnS/NSCTs is mainly attributed to the unique cream roll-like structure. More importantly, this simple method may be feasible for other anode materials, which will greatly promote the development of SIBs.",

To tackle these issues, carbon-coated WS2 (NTs-WS2@C) nanocomposites were prepared through a facile synthesis method that involved precipitating a carbon precursor (20% sucrose) on WS2 nanotubes, followed by annealing treatment under an argon environment. Thanks to the presence of highly conductive and mechanically robust carbon on the outer surface, NTs-WS2@C nanocomposites show improved electrochemical performance compared with bare NTs-WS2. After 60 cycles at 80 mA g-1 current density, the cells display high capacities of 305 mAh g-1 in LIBs and 152 mAh g-1 in SIBs, respectively. As the current density increases to 600 mA g-1, it provides specific capacities of 209 and 115 mAh g-1, correspondingly. The enhanced electrochemical performance in LIBs and SIBs is primarily attributed to the synergistic effects of the tubular architecture of WS2, carbon network and stable nanocomposite structure, which can effectively constrain volume variation during the metal ions intercalation/deintercalation processes.",

Herein, the electron configuration of Mo 4d orbitals is modulated and the stable 1T-MoS2 is constructed by nickel (Ni) introduction (1T-Ni-MoS2). The original electron configuration of Mo 4d orbitals is changed via the electron injection by Ni, which triggers the phase transition from 2H to 1T phase, thus improving the electrical conductivity and accelerating the redox kinetics of the material. Consequently, 1T-Ni-MoS2 exhibits superior rate capability (266.8 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1) and excellent cycle life (358.7 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 350 cycles).

        "abstract": "Mn-based layered oxide cathodes have attracted widespread attention due to high capacity and low cost, however, poor air stability, irreversible phase transitions, and slow kinetics inhibit their practical application. Here, we propose a universal interfacial reconstruction strategy based on converting residual alkali to tunnel phase Na0.44MnO2 for addressing the above mentioned issue simultaneously, using O3 NaNi0.4Fe0.2Mn0.4O2@2 mol % Na0.44MnO2 (NaNFM@NMO) as the prototype material. The optimized material exhibits an initial capacity and energy density comparable with lithium-ion batteries. The reversible anionic redox behavior and charge compensation mechanism of NaNFM@NMO were analyzed and verified by soft X-ray absorption spectrum and in situ X-ray absorption spectrum. Due to the intrinsic stability of the tunnel structure, excellent air stability and highly reversible structure evolution of the NaNFM@NMO cathode material are achieved, which are confirmed by contact angle test, rigorous aging test, and in situ X-ray diffraction. More importantly, the NaNFM@NMO cathode demonstrates a great match with the nonpresodiated hard carbon anode and shows excellent electrochemical performance of the full cell. Additionally, such a strategy could be also applied to modify P2-type cathodes, showing superior universality and good prospects in industrialized production. Overall, the proposed strategy could improve air stability while remaining interfacial and bulk stable simultaneously and will open up a whole new field for the optimization of other electrode materials.",

Additionally, the carbon coating can not only improve the electronic conductivity, but also suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides.",

Here, a design of freestanding porous‐yet‐dense carbon films with a tunable density (1.08–1.33 g cm−3) and porosity (specific surface area of 0–423.8 m2 g−1) is presented through an assembly of porous carbon nanosheet with graphene oxide under vacuum filtration. The typical freestanding carbon films simultaneously deliver a high density of 1.08 g cm−3 and a high specific surface area of 423.8 m2 g−1 when the porous carbon nanosheet content is 75 wt.%. As anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries, the optimized freestanding carbon films deliver high volumetric capacity (270 mAh cm−3 at 20 mA g−1), high initial capacity efficiency (81%) and superior long‐term cycling stability (1300 cycles with a capacity decay rate of 0.012% per cycle).

However, underneath these thermodynamic considerations lie kinetics factors leading to distinct Na+ versus Li+ storage mechanisms even within the same electrode materials, which is ascribed to either ionic size variations or diffusion path differences. Herein, the library of such non‐negligible factors is extended by targeting an alloying‐type bismuth anode well known for its high volumetric capacity for both Li+ and Na+ storage, showing that the mechanical property of key reaction intermediates also plays a role in differentiating its Na+ versus Li+ storage mechanisms. Applying spatially and temporally resolved in situ transmission electron microscopy to Li+ and Na+ storage within bismuth, it not only demonstrates the thermodynamic similarity in a step‐wise phase transition but also discloses its kinetic distinctions in morphological and structural integrities determined by Young's modulus of involving reaction intermediates and spatial configuration, which well accounts for the surprisingly observed superior Na+ storage performance of Bi anode compared to the inferior Li+ storage. Findings here highlight the role of reaction intermediates’ mechanical properties in regulating the overall cycling durability of electrode materials, and guide future material engineering toward performance enhancement, particularly for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIB), as one of the most appealing grid‐scale energy storage devices, have to deal with the trade‐off between the capacity output and rate performance. Utilizing 3D‐printed (3DP) anode materials with hybrid sodium storage mechanism and elevated mass loading is promising yet poorly explored. Herein, the design of a prototype ternary composite is reported, MoS2@Bi/N‐doped carbon, as a sodium storage candidate to achieve high reversible capacity (604 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 with an initial output of 709 mAh g−1) and outstanding rate capability (169.6 mAh g−1 at 15 A g−1), outperforming the state‐of‐the‐art reports. This is realized by delicate structural and interfacial engineering of the composite anode, markedly synergizing the conversion‐typed MoS2, alloy‐typed Bi, and adsorption‐typed N‐doped carbon. Theoretical simulations and operando instrumental analysis elaborate the reasons of the boosted electrochemical performance. Encouragingly, a fully 3DP SIB affording an areal mass loading of up to 11.7 mg cm−2 is demonstrated, retaining a capacity of 114 mAh g−1 at 1.0 A g−1.

Due to their high porosity, excellent adsorption and catalytic activity, as well as the possibility of simultaneous implementation of various charge accumulation mechanisms, they can be used as electrode materials for metal-ion batteries. However, a significant disadvantage is that most MOFs have a low electrical conductivity, and the production of conductive MOFs is a costly, time-consuming and technically difficult process. In this work, we developed a method for synthesizing the Zn2(EDTA)(H2O) MOF composite and studied the possibility of using it as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries based on aqueous electrolytes. The structure and morphology of the compound was studied using XRD, IR, TGA and SEM. Using cyclic voltammetry, the electrochemical characteristics of the organometallic framework in alkaline electrolytes 1, 10 M NaOH, as well as in saturated aqueous electrolyte NaClO4, were evaluated. It has been established that the studied compound does not give a satisfactory electrochemical response in aqueous electrolytes (both in alkaline and neutral media) due to the strong degradation of the electrode material, which is associated with the high solubility of this MOF representative. Cyclic voltammetric studies showed the presence of two redox processes due to the release of metallic zinc from an electrolyte solution, where two forms of zinc exist in equilibrium (the ZnEDTA complex and the free zinc cation). Therefore, we concluded, it is not possible to use this material as an anode for water-based sodium-ion batteries in contrary to a published research study.",

Herein, self‐freestanding membrane of cellulose‐derived carbon fibers is presented, delivering a reversible Na‐storage capacity of 330 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1 due to abundant ordered graphitic zones with enlarged interlayer spacings around 0.39 ± 0.03 nm.

A clear sodiation behavior of Na+ intercalation into enlarged carbon graphitic layers at the slope step above 0.10 V and Na cluster evolution in the micropores at the plateau step around 0.01–0.10 V is disclosed by high‐resolution element mapping microscopy, different from the accepted mechanism of Na+ intercalation into graphitic layers at the plateau step.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon attracts considerable attention as an anode material for sodium‐ion batteries; however, their poor rate capability and low realistic capacity have motivated intense research effort toward exploiting nanostructured carbons in order to boost their comprehensive performance. Ultramicropores are considered essential for attaining high‐rate capacity as well as initial Coulombic efficiency by allowing the rapid diffusion of Na+ and inhibiting the contact of the electrolyte with the inner carbon surfaces. Herein, hard carbon nanosheets with centralized ultramicropores (≈0.5 nm) and easily accessible carbonyl groups (CO)/hydroxy groups (OH) are synthesized via interfacial assembly and carbonization strategies, delivering a large capacity (318 mA h g−1 at 0.02 A g−1), superior rate capability (145 mA h g−1 at 5.00 A g−1), and approximately 95% of reversible capacity below 1.00 V. Notably, a new charge model favoring fast capacitive sodium storage with dual potential plateaus is proposed. That is, the deintercalation of Na+ from graphitic layers is manifested as the low‐potential plateau region (0.01−0.10 V), contributing to stable insertion capacity; meanwhile, the surface desodiation process of the CO and OH groups corresponds to the high‐potential plateau region (0.40−0.70 V), contributing to a fast capacitive storage.",

However, its charge storage mechanism is unclear, hindering further improvement of the cell performance.

To address this problem, ultrathin few‐layer bismuthene with a large aspect ratio is rationally synthesized, and can relieve the expansion strain along the z‐axis. A free‐standing bismuthene/graphene composite electrode with tunable thickness achieves a strikingly stable and high areal sodium storage capacity of 12.1 mAh cm−2, which greatly exceeds that of most reported electrode materials.

Herein, guided by the DFT calculation, Sb/Fe2S3 was fabricated by annealing Fe and Sb2S3 mixed powder. Next, Sb/Fe2S3 was blended with 15 wt % graphite by ball milling, yielding nano-Sb/Fe2S3 anchored on an exfoliated graphite composite (denoted as Sb/Fe2S3-15%).

        "abstract": "Titanium disulfide (TiS2 ) is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity, but it suffers from severe volume variation and shuttle effect of the intermediate polysulfides. To overcome the drawbacks, herein the successful fabrication of TiS2 @N,S-codoped C (denoted as TiS2 @NSC) through a chemical vapor reaction between Ti-based metal-organic framework (NH2 -MIL-125) and carbon disulfide (CS2 ) is demonstrated. The C─N bonds enhance the electronic/ionic conductivity of the TiS2 @NSC electrode, while the C─S bonds provide extra sodium storage capacity, and both polar bonds synergistically suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides. Consequently, the TiS2 @NSC electrode demonstrates outstanding cycling stability and rate performance, delivering reversible capacities of 418/392 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 2/5 A g-1 . Ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope analyses reveal that TiS2 undergoes an intercalation-conversion ion storage mechanism with the generation of metallic Ti in a deeper sodiation state, and the pristine hexagonal TiS2 is electrochemically transformed into cubic rock-salt TiS2 as a reversible phase with enhanced reaction kinetics upon sodiation/desodiation cycling. The strategy to encapsulate TiS2 in N,S-codoped porous carbon matrices efficiently realizes superior conductivity and physical/chemical confinement of the soluble polysulfides, which can be generally applied for the rational design of advanced electrodes.",

        "abstract": "Red phosphorus (P) have been considered as one of the most promising anode material for both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and (NIBs), because of its high theoretical capacity. However, natural insulating property and the large volume expansion of red P during cycling lead to poor cyclability and low rate performance, which prevents its practical application. Here, we significantly improves both lithium storage and sodium storage performance of red P by confining nanosized amorphous red P into the mesoporous carbon matrix (P@CMK-3) using a vaporization-condensation-conversion process. The P@CMK-3 shows a high reversible specific capacity of ∼ 2250 mA h g(-1) based on the mass of red P at 0.25 C (∼ 971 mA h g(-1) based on the composite), excellent rate performance of 1598 and 624 mA h g(-1) based on the mass of red P at 6.1 and 12 C, respectively (562 and 228 mA h g(-1) based on the mass of the composite at 6.1 and 12 C, respectively) and significantly enhanced cycle life of 1150 mA h g(-1) based on the mass of red P at 5 C (500 mA h g(-1) based on the mass of the composite) after 1000 cycles for LIBs. For Na ions, it also displays a reversible capacity of 1020 mA h g(-1) based on the mass of red P (370 mA h g(-1) based on the mass of the composite) after 210 cycles at 5C. The significantly improved electrochemical performance could be attributed to the unique structure that combines a variety of advantages: easy access of electrolyte to the open channel structure, short transport path of ions through carbon toward the red P, and high ionic and electronic conductivity.",

        "abstract": "Metal oxides, as promising electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries, usually need to be formed by exposure to oxygen, which usually thermally corrodes the carbon material with which they are compounded, reducing their flexibility and electrical conductivity. Herein, we present for the first time a preoxidation-assisted mechanism to prepare bismuth oxide and carbon nanofibers (Bi2O3@C-NFs) by electrospinning, using Bi2S3 nanorods as multifunctional templates. The bismuth could be oxidized by C═O bonds formed through the cyclization reaction in the high-temperature calcination process, effectively avoiding thermal corrosion of carbon in oxygen atmosphere at high temperature. More importantly, the uniformly distributed Bi2O3 nanodots and longitudinal tunnels are formed inside the S- and N-doped carbon nanofibers with the continuous diffusion of Bi generated from the decomposition of Bi2S3 nanorods and the conversion to Bi─O bonds with C═O bonds being broken. Benefiting from the structural and composition merits arising from preoxidation, Bi2O3@C-NFs self-supporting anodes show high specific capacity (439 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1), superior rate performance (243 mAh g-1 at a current density of 20 A g-1), and outstanding cycling stability (211 mAh g-1 after 2000 cycles at 5 A g-1).

Herein, a TiO2-coated MoP/phosphorus doped carbon (MoP@TiO2/P-C) nanorod with a new structure is constructed using TiO2-coated Mo-MOF as the precursor through an in situ topological conversion technique. In the synthesis process, the traditional highly toxic PH3 phosphorus is avoided. TEM results reveal that TiO2 nanoparticles are distributed at the interface between the MoP core and the P-doped carbon shell, which breaks the density of the carbon layer and facilitates ion transport. The GITT results demonstrate the fact that the diffusion coefficient of sodium ions is remarkably improved by two orders of magnitude due to the presence of TiO2. Notably, TiO2 can effectively cushion volume expansion with an almost negligible rate of 13%, allowing cells to manifest a high discharge capacity of 419 mA h g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 current density and exceptional stability where the specific capacity remains constant for 10 000 cycles at a high density of 10 A g-1 (∼81 seconds for one charging).

Among plenty of options, molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) has been the focus of research due to the graphene-like layered structure and unique electrochemical properties. Importantly, an abnormal capacity increase phenomenon was observed in the MoS2 anode of sodium-ion batteries, but the mechanisms involved are still unclear. In this study, by analyzing the composition and structure of the material after a different number of cycles, we confirmed that the (002) plane shows a significant expansion of the interlayer spacing after the sodium ion insertion process and a phase transformation from the hexagonal phase MoS2 (2H-MoS2) to the trigonal phase MoS2 (1T-MoS2). Moreover, the ratio of 1T-MoS2 presented an increasing trend during cycling. The dual-phase co-existence leads to enhanced electrical conductivity, higher Na affinity, and higher Na+ mobility, thus increasing the capacity. Our work provides a new perspective on the anomalous electrochemical behavior of sulfide anodes during long-term cycling.",

        "abstract": "To make sodium-ion batteries a realistic option for everyday energy storage, a practicable method is to enhance the kinetics of Na+ reactions through the development of structurally stable electrode materials. This study utilizes ternary Sn-based dichalcogenide (SnS1.5 Se0.5 ) in the design of electrode material to tackle several issues that adversely hinder the performance and longevity of sodium-ion batteries. First, the incorporation of Se into the SnS structure enhances its electrical conductivity and stability. Second, the ternary composition restricts the formation of intermediates during the desodiation/sodiation process, resulting in better electrode reaction reversibility. Finally, SnS1.5 Se0.5 lowers the diffusion barrier of Na, thereby facilitating rapid and efficient ion transport within the electrode material. Moreover, nitrogen and sulfur dual-doped carbon (NS-C) is used to enhance surface chemistry and ionic/electrical conductivity of SnS1.5 Se0.5 , leading to a pseudocapacitive storage effect that presents a promising potential for high-performance energy storage devices. The study has successfully developed a SnS1.5 Se0.5 /NS-C anode, exhibiting remarkable rate capability and cycle stability, retaining a capacity of 647 mAh g-1 even after 10 000 cycles at 5 A g-1 in half-cell tests. In full-cell tests, Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 //SnS1.5 Se0.5 /NS-C delivers a high energy density of 176.6 Wh kg-1 . In addition, the Na+ storage mechanism of SnS1.5 Se0.5 /NS-C is explored through ex situ tests and DFT calculations. The findings suggest that the ternary Sn-based dichalcogenides can considerably enhance the performance of the anode, enabling efficient large-scale storage of sodium. These findings hold great promise for the advancement of high-performance energy storage devices for practical applications.",

The formation mechanisms are illustrated as follows: 1) the “orient induction” to evoke “vine style” growth mechanism of ZnO; 2) the “dissolution–precipitation” of Ni; and 3) the “surface adsorption self‐limited” of Cu. Subsequently, the degree of graphitization, interlayer distance, and special surface area are investigated in detail. 1D structure from 700 °C as anode displays a high Na‐storage capacity of 301.2 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 200 cycles and 107 mAh g−1 at 5.0 A g−1 after 5000 cycles.

However, it still needs great efforts to develop electrode materials with ultrafast gravimetric and volumetric Na-storage performance, due to difficult balance between Na-ion diffusion kinetics and pressing density of materials. In this work, Bi2Se3/graphene composites, synthesized by a selenization reaction, are investigated as anode materials for SIBs. Na-ion storage mechanism of Bi2Se3 should be attributed to a combined conversion-alloying one by a series of ex situ measurements. In the composites, Bi2Se3 particles with an average diameter of 100 nm are uniformly dispersed onto graphene with strong interfacial interaction. Despite their nanoscale size, the pressing density of Bi2Se3/graphene composite could still reach a high value of 2.07 g/cm3. Therefore, the composites can deliver a high gravimetric specific capacity of 346 mAh/g and volumetric specific capacity of 716 mAh/cm3 at a current density of 0.1 A/g. Remarkably, the composites exhibit an ultrafast Na-storage capability and a negligible capacity fading with the increasing of current density from 0.2 to 5 A/g. Even at 10 A/g (≈30 C), the composites still possess a gravimetric capacity of 183 mAh/g and volumetric capacity of 379 mAh/cm3 with ultrastable cyclability up to 1000 cycles.

        "title": "Bi nanoparticles confined in N,S co-doped carbon nanoribbons with excellent rate performance for sodium-ion batteries.",
        "abstract": "Bismuth (Bi) has emerged as a promising candidate for sodium-ion battery anodes because of its unique layered crystal structure, superior volumetric capacity, and high theoretical gravimetric capacity. However, the large volume expansion and severe aggregation of Bi during the alloying/dealloying reactions are extremely detrimental to cycling stability, which seriously hinders its practical application. To overcome these issues, we propose an effective synthesis of composite materials, encapsulating Bi nanoparticles in N,S co-doped carbon nanoribbons and composites with carbon nanotubes (N,S-C@Bi/CNT), using Bi2S3 nanobelts as templates. The uniform distribution of Bi nanoparticles and the structure of carbon nanoribbons can reduce the diffusion path of ions/electrons, efficiently buffer the large volume change and prevent Bi from aggregating during cycles. As expected, the N,S-C@Bi/CNT electrode shows superior sodium storage performance in half cells, including a high specific capacity (345.3 mA h g-1 at 1.0 A g-1), long cycling stability (1000 cycles), and superior rate capability (336.0 mA h g-1 at 10.0 A g-1).",

        "abstract": "The search for advanced electrode materials to solve slow ion diffusion and poor conductivity issues has spurred the development of fast‐charging sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a 2D metallic anode, KCu4S3, is reported expertly crafted using a KSCN molten salt approach, laying the foundation for fast‐charging SIBs. It is found that the mixed metal‐valence states within this compound provide substantial advantages, particularly in enhancing the high‐rate capability and ensuring long‐term durability. The mechanism that appears to facilitate these benefits can be traced to the formation of NaCu2S2 intermediate, which assist in electron transfer during Na+ (de)intercalation. In situ observations confirm the sodiation products of NaCu2S2 and sodium polysulfide can recover to the original phase upon desodiation. Such distinctive characteristics endow KCu4S3 with remarkable electrochemical performances, including an impressive capacity of 355 mAh g−1 at 20 A g−1 and 100% capacity retention within 3000 cycles. Moreover, the full cell exhibits a high energy density of 332 Wh kg−1 and retains 92% of its capacity across 150 cycles at 1 A g−1. This work opens new horizons in the field of fast‐charging materials, making a significant step forward in shaping the future of SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The transition phenomenon involving copper replacing the transition metal elements within transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) is a recent and unique observation in the context of sodium ion batteries (SIBs) where TMCs serve as anodes. Fundamental understanding of the driving forces and kinetics governing this transition is crucial for elucidating the sodium storage mechanism in TMCs anodes. Herein, cobalt disulfide (CoS2) has been chosen as a representative anode. It is revealed that the transition behavior of copper replacing cobalt during the cycling originates from chemical/electrochemical dual‐driving forces. The chemical driving force emanates from the interaction between Cu+ dissolved in the electrolyte and the resulting sodium polysulfide products. The reaction extent is intricately linked to the surface roughness of the copper collector. The electrochemistrical driving force is effectively elucidated through the application of the Hard‐Soft‐Acid‐Base theory. Multiple charaterization techniques, such as Solid‐state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) have been employed to confirm that cobalt exists as cation instead of metal after transition. This research offers a novel perspective understanding the transition behavior exhibited by CoS2, with potential wider implications for understanding analogous behaviors in other metal sulfide anodes.",

However, its inherent thermodynamic instability often presents unparalleled challenges in phase control and stabilization. Here, a molecular intercalation strategy is developed to synthesize thermally stable 1T-rich MoSe2 , covalently bonded to an intercalated carbon layer (1TR /2H-MoSe2 @C). Density functional theory calculations uncover that the introduced ethylene glycol molecules not only serve as electron donors, inducing a reorganization of Mo 4d orbitals, but also as sacrificial guest materials that generate a conductive carbon layer. Furthermore, the C─Se/C─O─Mo bonds encourage strong interfacial electronic coupling, and the carbon layer prevents the restacking of MoSe2 , regulating the maximum 1T phase to an impressive 80.3%. Consequently, the 1TR /2H-MoSe2 @C exhibits an extraordinary rate capacity of 326 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 and maintains a long-term cycle stability up to 1500 cycles, with a capacity of 365 mAh g-1 at 2 A g-1 .

This formulation was optimized by leveraging competitive solvation effects between Mg2+ ions and two organic components. The full batteries based on this ternary eutectic electrolyte, Mn-doped sodium vanadate (Mn-NVO) anode, and copper hexacyanoferrate cathode exhibited an elevated voltage plateau and high rate capability and showcased stable cycling performance. Ex-situ characterizations unveiled the Mg2+ storage mechanism of Mn-NVO involving initial extraction of Na+ followed by subsequent Mg2+ intercalation/deintercalation. Detailed spectroscopic analyses illuminated the formation of a pivotal solid-electrolyte interphase on the anode surface. Moreover, the solid-electrolyte interphase demonstrated a dynamic adsorption/desorption behavior, referred to as the \"breathing effect\", which substantially mitigated undesired dissolution and side reactions of electrode materials. These findings underscore the crucial role of rational electrolyte design in fostering the development of a favorable solid-electrolyte interphase that can significantly enhance compatibility between electrode materials and electrolytes, thus propelling advancements in aqueous multivalent-ion batteries.",

Their greatly enhanced electrochemical performances can be attributed to the superior intrinsic conductivities and richer redox reactions, comparative to mono metal chalcogenides. To employ various binary metals comprising selenides (B-TMSs) for SIBs, discovery of a simplistic, scalable and universal synthesis approach is highly desirable. Herein, a simple, facile, and comprehensive strategy to produce various combinations of nanostructured B-TMSs is presented. As a proof of concept, optimized, high surface area bearing, and hierarchical nanosheets of iron-nickel selenide (FNSe), iron-cobalt selenide, and nickel-cobalt selenide are produced and employed in SIBs. These B-TMSs exhibit adequately high energy capacities, excellent rate capabilities, and an extraordinarily stable life of 2600 cycles. As far as it is known, it is the first work to discuss sodium storage of FNSe, so various in situ and ex situ battery analyses are carried out to probe the sodium storage mechanism. When employed in sodium full batteries, these B-TMSs present reasonably high reversible specific capacities even after 100 cycles. Overall, the presented strategy will pave the way for facile synthesis of numerous binary transition metal chalcogenides that are the potential materials for energy storage and conversion systems.",

Within the experimental part, water‐based slurries of the same composition are mixed using different active materials according to identical procedure and the viscosity is compared. When drying at a constant drying rate (0.75 g m‐2 s‐1), Lithium Iron Phosphate electrodes with different areal capacities (1‐3 mAh cm‐2) are shown to have the highest adhesion.

        "abstract": "Sodium metal batteries have emerged as potential rivals to lithium‐ion batteries. Nevertheless, maintaining a stable sodium metal anode under harsh conditions (current density >10 mA cm−2) is extremely challenging. The primary issue is the highly reactive sodium metal continuously reacts with the electrolyte to form a thick and loose solid electrolyte film. The tip effect causes sodium ions (Na+) accumulated in the bulge resulting in uneven deposition. In this paper, a unique artificial interfacial layer (Ag nanoparticles distributed in NaClO4‐based matrix) is prepared on the surface of a metallic sodium anode using in situ displacement reaction. Ag particles arranged at the bottom of the artificial layer act as effective nucleation sites helping Na+ deposit uniformly, while the built‐in electric field formed between Ag in the middle/top of the artificial layer and the sodium accelerates the migration of Na+ in the interfacial layer during the deposition and reduce the polarization. Such important properties further allow the steady operation of modified sodium metal batteries in very harsh conditions. The symmetric battery achieves reversible stripping/plating for over 1000 h under high current density (10 mA cm−2). Moreover, the full cell coupled with a high‐loading Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode (20 mg cm−2) presents a stable cycle performance.",

In this work, a unique architecture of bundled defect-rich MoS2 (BD-MoS2 ) that consists of MoS2 with large vacancies bundled by ultrathin MoO3 is achieved via a facile quenching process. When employed as anode for a SIB, the BD-MoS2 electrode exhibits an ultrafast charge/discharge due to the pseudocapacitive-controlled Na+ storage mechanism in it. Further experimental and theoretical calculations show that Na+ is able to cross the MoS2 layer by vacancies, not only limited to diffusion along the layer, thus realizing a 3D Na+ diffusion with faster kinetics. Meanwhile, the bundling architecture reduces the stack of sheets with a superior cycle life illustrating the highly reversible capacities of 350 and 272 mAh g-1 at 2 and 5 A g-1 after 1000 cycles.",

Due to the unique nanostructure and larger interlayer spacing, the MoS2/C nanoflower electrode achieves a high reversible specific capacity of 400 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles at 500 mA g-1 for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), showing a good cycling stability. The improved electrochemical performance suggests that the MoS2/C composite is a promising anode material for sodium ion storage.",

        "abstract": "Potassium- and sodium-ion batteries (PIBs and SIBs) have great potential as the next-generation energy application owing to the natural abundance of K and Na. Antimony (Sb) is a suitable alloying-type anode for PIBs and SIBs due to its high theoretical capacity and proper operation voltage; yet, the severe volume variation remains a challenge. Herein, a preparation of N-doped carbon-wrapped Sb nanoparticles (L-Sb/NC) using pulsed laser ablation and polydopamine coating techniques, is reported. As the anode for PIB and SIB, the L-Sb/NC delivers superior rate capabilities and excellent cycle stabilities (442.2 and 390.5 mA h g-1 after 250 cycles with the capacity decay of 0.037% and 0.038% per cycle) at the current densities of 0.5 and 1.0 A g-1 , respectively. Operando X-ray diffraction reveals the facilitated and stable potassiation and sodiation mechanisms of L-Sb/NC enabled by its optimal core-shell structure. Furthermore, the SIB full cell fabricated with L-Sb/NC and Na3 V2 (PO4 )2 F3 shows outstanding electrochemical performances, demonstrating its practical energy storage application.",

        "title": "Chemical crosslinking regulating microstructure of lignin‐derived hard carbon for high‐performance sodium storage",
        "abstract": "Lignin, a biomass derived polymer, has gained considerable recognition as a highly promising precursor of hard carbon primarily due to its ample reserve, eco‐friendliness, and cost‐effectiveness. However, lignin‐derived hard carbon via direct carbonization generally yields suboptimal performance for sodium storage due to the unsuitable microstructure. Herein, a simple phytic acid activation combined high‐temperature annealing strategy is proposed to regulate the microstructure of lignin‐derived hard carbon for high‐performance sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) anode. Phytic acid activation not only reduces the ordering and creates abundant closed pores through improving the crosslinking degree and thermal stability of lignin but also introduces P heteroatoms to effectively expand the interlayer spacing of the derived hard carbon. High‐temperature carbonization further increases the size of closed pores, leading to a more favorable sodium storage in the plateau region. Consequently, the optimal phytic acid activating lignin derived hard carbon (PLHC 1300) delivers a high capacity of 380.3 mAh g−1 with an enhanced plateau capacity ratio of near 68.1% at 30 mA g−1, and achieves a capacity retention of near 100% after 150 cycles at 1 A g−1. This work significant advances the application of lignin in energy storage and contributes to the progression of commercial SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Attracted by the high specific capacity and energy density, transition metal‐sulfides exhibit great application potential as sodium‐ion batteries anode, but still suffer from the uncontrolled separation of M/S phase and inferior conductivity. Herein, the flower‐like Fe1‐xS@Sb@C (FF) is rationally tailored, accompanied by double‐layer heterojunctions and C–S–Sb/Sb–S–Fe “bridge” bonds. Meanwhile, the bimetallic phases/boundary defects and built‐in electric fields are formed with a strong electronic coupling effect, effectively alleviating the separation of the M/S phase (Fe/Sb and S), and significantly enhancing ion/e− conductivity. As expected, FF delivers an ultra‐fast sodium‐ions storage rate capacity of 436.5/334.3 mAh g−1 even at 10.0/20.0 A g−1. When the operation temperature is lowered to ‐5 °C, the reversible capacity can still remain at ≈349.7 mAh g−1. Assisted by the detailed kinetic analysis and theoretical calculations, their great ion‐storage abilities mainly derive from improved interfacial Na+/e− transfer and surface/near‐surface redox behaviors. Moreover, the reassembling evolution of active phases is revealed by in/ex situ techniques, further demonstrating the stable adsorption/anchoring of intermediate reaction products Fe/Sb–S phases on the heterointerface, accompanying high reversible conversion‐alloying reaction. Given this, this interesting work is anticipated to offer an in‐depth insight into capacity fading mechanism, and effective strategy to design metal‐sulfur anodes for advanced sodium‐ion systems.",

        "abstract": "MXenes, as excellent candidate anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs), suffer from the sluggish ion-diffusion kinetics resulting from the anchoring effect of the negatively-charged functional groups on their surface on sodium ions. Herein, we introduce positively-charged conductive polyaniline (PANI) to induce self-assembly of Ti3C2Tx MXenes into three-dimensional PANI/Ti3C2Tx network. In this PANI/Ti3C2Tx network, PANI not only intercalates into Ti3C2Tx nanosheets to enlarge the interlayer spacing, but also promotes negative-to-positive transition of the surface charges of the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, significantly improving ion-diffusion kinetics. Electrochemical test results further confirm the superb ion-diffusion kinetics of PANI/Ti3C2Tx network. Meanwhile, a covalent interaction (Ti-N) between PANI and Ti3C2Tx, proved by X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) tests, plays a key role in stabilizing this network structure. Therefore, PANI/Ti3C2Tx exhibits excellent sodium storage performances with a high specific capacity, superior rate performance and ultra-long lifespan at high current density. More importantly, when operated at the rigorous temperatures from 50 oC to -30 oC, PANI/Ti3C2Tx also exhibits good electrochemical performances.

        "abstract": "Metal-polydopamine coordination chemistry attracts great attention owing to the synergistic effect of adjustable components and advantageous structures. However, few efforts have been devoted to exploring bimetal-polydopamine composites, especially for multistructural composites with high-capacity components and high stability. In this regard, the TiO2 @C-WSe2 core-shell nanospheres are designed and fabricated based on Ti-W-polydopamine composites after selenization, in which the TiO2 nanoparticles are encapsulated or embedded in the carbon nanospheres and the external WSe2 nanosheets are grown epitaxially on the carbon surfaces, featuring multiple channels for ion diffusion and abundant active edges for electrochemical reactions. The introduction of WSe2 not only greatly improves the capacity but also results in exponential growth of the active edge. As a result, the as-prepared TiO2 @C-WSe2 displayed long-term cycling performance in lithium-ion batteries. Furthermore, the anode is assembled into sodium-ion batteries, manifesting a stable capacity of 352 mA h g-1 at 1.0 A g-1 even after 2000 cycles, one of the best performances for polydopamine-based composites. Enhanced performance can be attributed to the synergies of high-capacity components and different dimensional materials.

        "abstract": "In lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), separator is used to provide a barrier between the anode and cathode and provide freedom for the transport of lithium‐ions, which serves a key function in inhibiting internal short circuit and improving the battery safety. The limited wettability of commercial polyolefin separators in electrolytes restricts its utilization in extreme environmental conditions. In our work, we choose polypropylene (PP) as the precursor and can address the issue of poor wettability through suitable modification methods. Tannic acid (TA) and diethylenetriamine (DETA) were utilized to coat PP separator via hierarchical self‐assembly approach, and the coating is further stabilized by taking advantage of the specific oxidizing properties of sodium periodate. This method scarcely increases the separator thickness or sacrifices the microporous structure of the original separator. The improved separator not only exhibits outstanding wetting capability and relatively high ion conductivity (1.24 mS cm−1), but also has the highest lithium‐ion migration number of 0.74. This indicates that when the modified separator is applied to LIBs, its electrochemical performance is significantly enhanced. The enhancement in electrochemical performance of LIBs is attributed to the strong absorption and retention ability of the coating on the separator. The reversible capacity of Li/PP‐TD2 separator/LiFePO4 battery is 144.3 mAh g−1 at 2C, which is higher than that of PP separator (117.1 mAh g−1) under the same current density. Even after 200 cycles, the PP‐TD2 separator with two‐layer assembly modification still maintains a higher coulombic efficiency of 97.55% and a discharge capacity of 96.6%. This hierarchical self‐assembly modification of PP provides an effective approach for fabricating high‐performance separator.",

The physical and electrochemical compatibilities of the TMP electrolyte are investigated by igniting, ionic conductivity, cyclic voltammetry, and charge–discharge measurements.

Based on these results, a nonflammable sodium‐ion battery is constructed by use of Sb anode, NaNi0.35Mn0.35Fe0.3O2 cathode, and TMP + 10 vol% FEC electrolyte, which works very well with considerable capacity and cyclability, demonstrating a promising prospect to build safer sodium‐ion batteries for large‐scale energy storage applications.",

However, it is difficult for traditional synthesis methods to synthesize LVTS without impurities. The electric field regulation method possesses the advantages of flexibility and high efficiency, achieving accurate control of the metal reduction process by adjusting the electrolysis potential and reaction time. In this work, we synthesized a series of LVTS (TiS and Ti2S) using electric field control methods and investigated their electrochemical behaviors as sodium storage anodes for the first time. Compared with traditional TiS2, LVTS display remarkable Na storage properties under the condition of complete electrochemical conversion at 0.005-3 V. Especially for TiS, it demonstrates a high capacity of 409 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 and inspiring cyclic stability over 6000 cycles. The large number of vacancies in the crystal structure can chemically anchor polysulfides and alleviate their dissolution in the electrolyte, resulting in superior long-term cyclic stability. The high intrinsic conductivity of LVTS is in favor of rapid transfer of electrons and promotes the fast conversion of polysulfides to sodium sulfides, thus realizing high reversible capacities. Moreover, with its fast Na+ transport kinetics, the as-prepared TiS demonstrates an impressive rate performance of 321 mAh g-1 at 15 A g-1. Overall, the electric field regulation method is flexible and efficient, which provides a new route for the preparation of high-performance electrode materials. Moreover, nonstoichiometric metal compounds possess abundant active sites and rapid electron transport kinetics, which provide a new choice for promising sodium storage materials in large-scale energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "Silicon is a promising anode material for next generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) because of its surprisingly high theoretical capacity, but it suffers from severe volume changes during charge and discharge process which results in substantial deterioration of the electrode. A novel fluorinated copolymer with three different polar groups was synthesized to overcome this problem: carboxylic acid, amid and fluorinated groups on a single polymer backbone. Moreover, a dual crosslinked network binder was prepared by thermal polymerization of the fluorinated copolymer and sodium alginate. Unlike the common chemical crosslinked network with a gradual and nonreversible fracturing, the dual crosslinked network which combine chemical and physical crosslinking could effectively hold the silicon particles during the volume change process. As a result, excellent electrochemical performance (1557 mAh g-1 at a 4 A g-1 current destiny after 200 cycles) was achieved with this novel reversible crosslinked binder. Further researches in regard to the influences of fluorine and acrylamide content were conducted to systematically evaluate designed binder. Moreover, with the help of new binder, the silicon/graphite and silicon oxide/graphite electrode exhibit superb cycle performance with capacity fade rate of 0.1% and 0.025% per cycle over 200 and 700 cycles, respectively. Such a novel and facile design represents a resultful method manufacturing high-performance Si-based anodes and advancing the realization of practical application.",

        "abstract": "Flexible polypyrrole (PPy) films with highly ordered structures were fabricated by a novel vapor phase polymerization (VPP) process and used as the anode material in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The PPy films demonstrate excellent rate performance and cycling stability. At a charge/discharge rate of 1 C, the reversible capacities of the PPy film anode reach 284.9 and 177.4 mAh g-1 in LIBs and SIBs, respectively. Even at a charge/discharge rate of 20 C, the reversible capacity of the PPy film anode retains 54.0% and 52.9% of the capacity of 1 C in LIBs and SIBs, respectively. After 1000 electrochemical cycles at a rate of 10 C, there is no obvious capacity fading. The molecular structure and electrochemical behaviors of Li- and Na-ion doping and dedoping in the PPy films are investigated by XPS and ex situ XRD. It is believed that the PPy film electrodes in the overoxidized state can be reversibly charged and discharged through the doping and dedoping of lithium or sodium ions. Because of the self-adaptation of the doped ions, the ordered pyrrolic chain structure can realize a fast charge/discharge process. This result may substantially contribute to the progress of research into flexible polymer electrodes in various types of batteries.",

        "abstract": "The serious dendrite growth and H2O-induced side reactions on the Zn electrode lead to a significant fading in the cycling performance, hindering the development of commercial applications of aqueous Zn-ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, a novel bifunctional network coating of dynamically cross-linking sodium alginate with trehalose has been rationally constructed on the Zn anode (Zn@AT). Firstly, the AT coating possesses abundant zinophilic oxygen-containing functional groups, which are able to induce uniform Zn2+ ion flux. Secondly, the AT coating as a solid barrier can effectively inhibit H2O-induced side reactions by lowering the activity of H2O molecules. More specially, based on the dynamic cross-linking, AT network coating is endowed with self-healing capacity during cycling for durable battery operation. Consequentially, Zn@AT anodes in symmetric cells can cycle stably for 2787 h at 2 mA cm-2/2 mAh cm-2, and even achieve a significantly long cycle performance of 1087 h at large charge/discharge depths of 10 mA cm-2/10 mAh cm-2. Moreover, the Zn@AT//MnO2 full cell shows excellent specific capacity of 175 mAh g-1 after 400 cycles. This study lights an effective strategy to enhance the durability of Zn electrodes in AZIBs.",

        "abstract": "A novel core-shell Fe3O4@FeS composed of Fe3O4 core and FeS shell with the morphology of regular octahedra has been prepared via a facile and scalable strategy via employing commercial Fe3O4 as the precursor. When used as anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), the prepared Fe3O4@FeS combines the merits of FeS and Fe3O4 with high Na-storage capacity and superior cycling stability, respectively. The optimized Fe3O4@FeS electrode shows ultralong cycle life and outstanding rate capability. For instance, it remains a capacity retention of 90.8% with a reversible capacity of 169 mAh g-1 after 750 cycles at 0.2 A g-1 and 151 mAh g-1 at a high current density of 2 A g-1, which is about 7.5 times in comparison to the Na-storage capacity of commercial Fe3O4. More importantly, the prepared Fe3O4@FeS also exhibits excellent full-cell performance. The assembled Fe3O4@FeS//Na3V2(PO4)2O2F sodium-ion full battery gives a reversible capacity of 157 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles at 0.5 A g-1 with a capacity retention of 92.3% and the Coulombic efficiency of around 100%, demonstrating its applicability for sodium-ion full batteries as a promising anode. Furthermore, it is also disclosed that such superior electrochemical properties can be attributed to the pseudocapacitive behavior of FeS shell as demonstrated by the kinetics studies as well as the core-shell structure. In view of the large-scale availability of commercial precursor and ease of preparation, this study provide a scalable strategy to develop advanced anode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Because of the large abundance of sodium (Na) as a source material and the easy fabrication of Na‐containing compounds, the sodium (Na) battery is a more environmentally friendly and sustainable technology than the lithium‐ion battery (LIB). Na‐metal batteries (SMBs) are considered promising to realize a high energy density to overtake the cost effectiveness of LIBs, which is critically important in large‐scale applications such as grid energy storage. However, the cycling stability of the Na‐metal anode faces significant challenges particularly under high cycling capacities, due to the complex failure models caused by the formation of Na dendrites. Here, a universal surface strategy, based on a self‐regulating alloy interface of the current collector, to inhibit the formation of Na dendrites is reported. High‐capacity (10 mAh cm−2) Na‐metal anodes can achieve stable cycling for over 1000 h with a low overpotential of 35 mV. When paired with a high‐capacity Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode (7 mAh cm−2), the SMB delivers an unprecedented energy density (calculated based on all the cell components) over 200 Wh kg−1 with flooded electrolyte, or over 230 Wh kg−1 with lean electrolyte. The dendrite‐free SMB also shows high cycling stability with a capacity retention per cycle over 99.9% and an ultrahigh energy efficiency of 95.8%.",

        "abstract": "P2‐type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 is a dominant cathode material for sodium‐ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity and energy density. However, charging P2‐type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 to voltages higher than 4.2 V (vs. Na+/Na) can induce detrimental structural transformation and severe capacity fading. Herein, stable cycling and moisture resistancy of Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 at 4.35 V (vs. Na+/Na) are achieved through dual‐site doping with Cu ion at transition metal site (2a) and unusual Zn ion at Na site (2d) for the first time. The Cu ion doping in 2a site stabilizes the metal layer, while more importantly, the unusual alkali‐metal site doping by Zn ion serves as O2‐Zn2+O2‐ “pillar” for enhancing electrostatic cohesion between two adjacent transition metal layers, preventing the crack of active material along the a–b‐plane and restraining the generation of O2 phase upon deep desodiation. This unique dual‐site‐doped [Na0.67Zn0.05]Ni0.18Cu0.1Mn0.67O2 cathode exhibits a prominent cyclability with 80.6% capacity retention over 2000 cycles at an ultrahigh rate of 10C, demonstrating its great potential for practical applications.

Herein, a thermodynamics-driven morphology manipulation strategy is reported to tailor VS4 nanosheets into 3D hierarchical self-assembled architectures including nanospheres, hollow nanospheres, and nanoflowers. The ultrathin VS4 nanosheets are generated via 2D anisotropic growth by the strong driving force of coordination interaction from ammonium ions under microwave irradiation and then evolve into 3D sheet-assembled configurations by adjusting the thermodynamic factors of temperature and reaction time. The as-synthesized VS4 nanomaterials present good electrochemical performances as the anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. In particular, the hollow VS4 nanospheres show a specific capacity of 1226.7 mAh g-1 at 200 mA g-1 current density after 100 cycles. The hierarchical nanostructures with large specific surface area and structural stability can overcome the difficulty of sodium ions embedding into the bulk material interior and provide more reactive materials at the same material mass loading compared with other morphologies. Both experiment and DFT calculations suggest that VS4 nanosheets reduce reaction kinetic impediment of sodium ion in battery operating.

Based on these advantages, the harmonized sulfur-carbon material exhibited a high reversible capacity of 146 mA h g-1 at an extremely high specific current of 100 A g-1 and long-term galvanostatic cycling stability at 10 and 100 A g-1 with superior electrochemical performance.

        "abstract": "Despite the crystallization of inorganic salt is being technologically related to the fabrication of salt-templated materials, the two key steps, nucleation and crystal growth, still lack the kinetic control to enable precise design of salt scaffolds. Here, we study how the undercooling degree controls the construction of salt scaffolds by kinetically manipulating the nucleation and growth rates in a NaCl-F127-rhodanine system. An effective approach based on undercooling-directed NaCl crystallization is further proposed to tailor the morphology and structure of the carbon materials. Under different undercooling conditions (liquid nitrogen, -55 °C and -25 °C freezing), the salt scaffold can be tuned as spheroidal particles, ellipsoidal nanocrystal aggregates and cubic nanocrystals with round corners, respectively. Correspondingly, hollow carbon nanospheres, nanocavity-linked graphene networks (CGN) and graphene nanosheets (GNS) can be fabricated through a salt template method, respectively. The Li+ and Na+ storage mechanisms of 3D CGN and 2D GNS are discussed, focusing on the ion diffusion kinetics. The enhanced Li+ diffusion kinetics in the 3D interconnected network endows CGN with better rate performance than GNS as lithium-ion battery anode material, and Na+ adsorption dominates the Na+ storage in CGN as sodium-ion battery anode material. Our findings provide a general idea for the construction crystallization-induced architectures and offer valuable insights to achieve fast Li+/Na+ storage by boosting the ion diffusion kinetics.",

Nevertheless, the practical electrochemical performance is severely hampered by poor cyclability due to volumetric expansion of Ge upon cycling. Herein, double-carbon confined cobalt germanium hydroxide (CGH@C/rGO) composites has been facilely synthesized with the supportion of l-ascorbic acid and graphene oxide (GO) as anode materials for sodium-ion storage. As a result, the CGH@C/rGO anode delivers a high cyclic stability with a reversible capacity of 416 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g-1 and an excellent rate capability of 206 mA h g-1 at 2000 mA g-1 compared with CGH, CGH@C and CGH/rGO composites. Besides, the reversible capacity of 266 mA h g-1 still remained even after 500 cycles at current density of 1 A g-1. Such outstanding electrochemical performance could be accredited to a strong interaction between CGH, carbon, and graphene, which increases the electronic conductivity, relieves the volume expansion aroused by sodiation/desodiation, shortens the pathway of electron/ion transportation that further improving the reaction kinetics and endowing the material with remarkable cycling capability.

The key to our success is a delicately designed, self-organized, strongly interactive porous P/C structure filled with sodium alginate binder, which maintains the structural integrity of anode and enhances the electrical contact of red P upon its volume variation via a dual protection from porous structure and strong surface interactions. The APC anodes hence present ultrahigh initial Coulombic efficiency (86.2%), excellent cycling stability, and superior rate capability. The industrially adaptable process and excellent electrochemical performance endow the novel APC nano/microspheres with promising applications in high-performance Na-ion batteries.",

Motivated by the promise of group XIV elements (namely, Si, Ge, and Sn) as anodes for lithium- and sodium-ion batteries, here, we conduct systematic first-principles calculations to explore the thermodynamics and kinetics of group XIV anodes for MIBs and to identify the atomistic mechanisms of the electrochemical insertion reactions of Mg ions. We confirm the formation of amorphous Mg xX phases (where X = Si, Ge, and Sn) in anodes via the breaking of the stronger X-X bonding network replaced by weaker Mg-X bonding. Mg ions have higher diffusivities in Ge and Sn anodes than in Si, resulting from weaker Ge-Ge and Sn-Sn bonding networks. In addition, we identify thermodynamic instabilities of Mg xX that require a small overpotential to avoid aggregation (plating) of Mg at anode/electrolyte interfaces. Such comprehensive first-principles calculations demonstrate that amorphous Ge and crystalline Sn can be potentially effective anodes for practical applications in MIBs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Efficient energy storage systems are crucial for the optimal utilization of renewable energy. Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are considered potential substitutes for next‐generation low‐cost energy storage systems due to the low cost and abundance of sodium resources. However, the industrialization of SIBs faces a great challenge in terms of the anode. Hard carbon could be a promising anode material due to its high capacity and low cost which originates from biomass. This study used pre‐treatment and template carbonization methods to extract a hard carbon material from a large amount of discarded biomass in bamboo powder waste. This material has a good initial Coulombic efficiency of 78.6 % and good cycling stability when applied to sodium ion batteries.Typically, the optimal hard carbon material is used as the anode to prepare sodium ion battery prototypes to demonstrate their potential applications. The anode exhibited excellent sodium storage performance with a reversible capacity of 303 mAh ⋅ g−1 at 1 C rate and good cycling performance, retaining 92.0 % of its capacity after 100 cycles. These results demonstrate that BPPHC is a promising candidate for anode material in sodium‐ion batteries. This work suggests that bamboo powder could be a low‐cost anode material for SIBs.",

Nevertheless, the volume expansion problem during lithium insertion/extraction processes has severely hindered their practical application. In particular, nano–micro hierarchical structure is attractive with the integrated advantages of nano-effect and high thermal stability of the microstructure. Herein, hierarchical Sn/SnO nanosheets assembled by carbon-coated hollow nanospheres were successfully synthesized by a facile glucose-assisted hydrothermal method, in which the glucose served as both morphology-control agent and carbon source. The hierarchical Sn/SnO nanosheets exhibit excellent electrochemical performances owing to the unique configuration and carbon coating. Specifically, a reversible high capacity of 2072.2 mA h g−1 was observed at 100 mA g−1. Further, 964.1 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1 and 820.4 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1 after 300 cycles could be obtained. Encouragingly, the Sn/SnO also presents certain sodium ion storage properties.

However, the huge volumetric variation in sodiation/desodiation reactions usually results in the fast decay of rate and cycling properties, which seriously obstructs its future applicable foregrounds. Herein, heterostructured Mn-Sn bimetallic sulfide nanocubes confined in N and S-codoped carbon (MSS@NSC) were rationally designed via a facile coprecipitation followed by a sulfurization strategy. When used as anodes for SIBs, the heterojunctions at the interfaces effectively accelerate the Na+ diffusion rate to promote the sodium-storage reaction kinetics. The N and S-codoped carbon provides a rapid conductive framework for the fast charge transport during the sodium-storage process. Moreover, the beneficial confinement effect of the NSC layer effectively guarantees a superb cycle property for the MSS@NSC anode. The favorable synergistic effects between the highly conductive framework of the NSC and MSS heterostructure endow the MSS@NSC anode with satisfactory electrochemical Na-storage properties.",

        "abstract": "Conversion/alloying type anodes have shown great promise for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of their high theoretical capacity. However, the poor structural stability derived from the large volume expansion and short lifetime impedes their further practical applications. Herein, we report a novel anode with a pomegranate-like nanostructure of SnP2O7 particles homogeneously dispersed in the robust N-doped carbon matrix. For the first time, we make use of in situ self-nanocrystallization to generate ultrafine SnP2O7 particles with a short pathway of ions and electrons to promote the reaction kinetics. Ex situ transmission electron microscope (TEM) shows that the average particle size of SnP2O7 decreases from 66 to 20 nm successfully based on this unique nanoscale-engineering method. Therefore, the nanoparticles together with the N-doped carbon contribute a high pseudocapacitance contribution. Moreover, the N-doped carbon matrix forms strong interaction with the self-nanocrystallization ultrafine SnP2O7 particles, leading to a stable nanostructure without any particle aggregation under a long-cycle operation. Benefiting from these synergistic merits, the SnP2O7@C anode shows a high specific capacity of 403 mAh g-1 at 200 mA g-1 and excellent cycling stability (185 mAh g-1 after 4000 cycles at 1000 mA g-1).

Here, a strategy is reported to realize high‐performance dual‐carbon SIHCs using 3D porous graphitic carbon cathode and anode materials derived from metal–azolate framework‐6s (MAF‐6s). First, MAF‐6s, with or without urea loading, are pyrolyzed to synthesize MAF‐derived carbons (MDCs). Then, cathode materials are synthesized via the controlled KOH‐assisted pyrolysis of MDCs (K‐MDCs). K‐MDCs, 3D graphitic carbons, resulting in a record‐high surface area (5214 m2 g−1) being ≈four‐fold higher than pristine MAF‐6, oxygen‐doped sites for high capacity, rich mesopores affording fast ion transport, and high capacity retention over 5000 charge/discharge cycles. Moreover, 3D porous MDC anode materials are synthesized from N‐containing MAF‐6 and exhibited to allow cycle stability over 5000 cycles. Furthermore, dual‐carbon MDC//K‐MDC SIHCs with different loadings (3 to 6 mg cm−2) are demonstrated to achieve high energy densities exceeding those of sodium‐ion batteries and supercapacitors.

Here, various NCDCMs have been successfully controlled and synthesized by small molecule polymerization methods, and their synthesis process has been also verified by NMR, MOLDI-TOF, TG-MS, etc. When serving as sodium ion battery anodes, the NCDCMs dominated by a high concentration of pyrrolic N (>80.3%) exhibits a satisfactory reversible capacity (434.5 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1 and 146.7 mA h g-1 at 2000 mA g-1, respectively). It is revealed that pyrrolic N has more suitable adsorption energy and larger interlayer spacing, by density functional theory calculations and electron orbital theory, respectively, which synergistically makes the material obtain excellent electrochemical performance. This research exhibits a more efficient way to reveal the differences in the sodium ions storage behavior of different nitrogen configurations doped carbon, and provides new insight for the precise design and synthesis of a certain type of heteroatom doping to achieve satisfactory electrochemical performance.",

The results show that Na2O2 has good chemical and storage stability under a dry atmosphere and has no negative effect on the electrochemical performance of the cathode. Compared with the pristine cathode, the Na2O2-decorated cathode exhibits higher discharge capacity, superior capacity retention, and rate capability in a full cell with a carbon anode.

However, they face significant challenges due to the mismatch between the sluggish Faradaic reaction anode and the swift non‐Faradaic cathode.

Benefiting from the synergistic effect of molecular design and hierarchical structural engineering, the obtained TA‐DH‐COF/GA anode possesses abundant accessible active sites and efficient ions and electrons transport pathways. Combining theoretical calculations and spectroscopic studies, it is revealed that the Na‐storage mechanism and transportation kinetics of the TA‐DH‐COF/GA are based on the reversible Na+ coordination by abundant accessible active sites through a four‐stage process, featuring capacitive energy storage characteristics. When coupled with an activated carbon (AC) cathode, the TA‐DH‐COF/GA||AC SIC device displays ultrahigh energy/power densities (≈56 Wh kg−1 and ≈10 000 W kg−1) and long‐term cyclic stability with 88.8% capacity retention after 18 000 cycles, outperforming existing SIC counterparts. This study illuminates the potential of COF‐based materials in SICs to achieve high energy/power density.",

        "abstract": "Developing a high-performance anode with high reversible capacity, rate performance, and great cycling stability is highly important for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). MoS2 has attracted extensive interest as the anode for SIBs. Herein, the vertically oxygen-incorporated MoS2 nanosheets/carbon fibers are constructed via a facile hydrothermal method and then by simple calcination in air. Oxygen incorporation into MoS2 can increase the defect degree and expand the interlayer spacing. Vertical MoS2 nanosheet array coated on carbon fibers not only can expose rich active sites and reduce the diffusion distance of Na+, but also improve the electronic conductivity and enhance structural stability. Meanwhile, interlayer-expanded MoS2 can decrease Na+ diffusion resistance and increase accessible active sites for Na+. In this work, the electrode combining the oxygen-incorporated strategy with vertical MoS2 nanosheet-integrated carbon fibers displays high specific capacities of 330 mAh g-1 over 100 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g-1 together with excellent rate behavior as the anode for SIBs.

In this work, we report the construction of a walnut-like core-shell MoS2@SnS heterostructure composite as an anode for SIBs with high capacity, remarkable rate and superior cycling stability. Experimental observations and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the enhanced electrochemical performances can be mainly ascribed to the boosted charge transfer and ion diffusion capabilities at the heterostructure interface driven by a self-building internal electric field.

        "abstract": "Rechargeable sodium‐metal batteries (RSMBs) with high energy density and low cost are attracting extensive attention as promising energy‐storage technologies. However, the poor cyclability and safety issues caused by unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) structure and dendrite issues limit their practical application. Herein, it is theoretically predicted that constructing the Ni3S2/Ni3P heterostructure with high work function can lower the Fermi energy level, and therefore effectively suppressing continuous electrolyte decomposition derived from the electron‐tunneling effect after long‐term sodiation process. Furthermore, the Ni3S2/Ni3P heterostructure on 3D porous nickel foam (Ni3S2/Ni3P@NF) is experimentally fabricated as an advanced Na‐anode current collector. The seamless Ni3S2/Ni3P heterostructure not only offers abundant active sites to induce uniform Na+ deposition and enhance ion‐transport kinetics, but also facilitates the formation of stable SEI for dendrite‐free sodium anode, which are confirmed by cryogenic components transmission electron microscopy tests and in situ spectroscopy characterization. As a result, the Na‐composite anode (Ni3S2/Ni3P@NF@Na) delivers stable plating/stripping process of 5000 h and high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% over 2500 cycles. More impressively, the assembled sodium‐ion full cell displays ultralong cycle life of 10 000 cycles at 20 C.

        "abstract": "Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are emerging as a powerful alternative to lithium-ion battery systems in large-scale energy storage owing to plentiful resources. Nevertheless, pursuing high-yield anode materials with high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and superior rate capability is still one of the most critical challenges in practical application. Herein, an integrated electrode (PC-x) derived from a petroleum coke precursor (carbon residue rate as high as 89%) is regulated from microstructural engineering to binder optimization devoting to high ICE and efficient potassium storage. Excitingly, with a strong assist from a sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binder, the PC-900 anode displays an ultrahigh ICE of 80.5%, one of the highest values reported for PIB carbon anodes. Simultaneously, the PC-900 anode submits a high capacity (304.3 mAh g-1), superb rate (138.2 mAh g-1 at 10C), and excellent stability. Furthermore, the full cell exhibits an outstanding rate and cycling performance (210.7 mAh g-1 at 0.5C), confirming its large-scale application prospects. The ultrahigh ICE and excellent performance are mainly attributable to the beneficial microstructures (low surface area, functional group content, and larger interlayer spacing) created by microstructural engineering. Meanwhile, binder optimization also plays a crucial role in reducing the irreversible capacity and interface impedance, further improving the ICE and rate capability. Importantly, mechanism analysis confirms two-stage K+ storage behavior: reversible adsorption at edges and defects (>0.25 V) and intercalation into crystalline layers (<0.25 V). This work provides an efficient and easily scalable electrode design strategy for future practical applications of PIBs.",

The improved sodium storage performance results from the unique 3D structure, abundant defects, and increased interlayer spacing of S-NCNFs.

        "abstract": "In selecting electrolytes for Na‐ion batteries, simply importing the analogue of common Li‐ion battery electrolytes to Na‐ion batteries does not address safety concerns like toxicity and flammability. Electrolytes based on sodium bis(oxalato)borate (NaBOB) in organophosphates like triethyl phosphate (TEP) largely alleviate these specific safety concerns. However, it may be beneficial to obtain solutions with higher ionic conductivities than NaBOB in TEP, and compare the performance in Na‐ion batteries with high mass loading electrodes. Here, we have shown that N,N‐dimethyl formamide (DMF), N,N‐dimethyl acetamide (DMAc), and N‐methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) cosolvents almost double the ionic conductivity (from ~3.5 mS/cm to ~7 mS/cm) without sacrificing the flame‐retarding properties of the base NaBOB in TEP electrolyte. The physical properties of these cosolvent electrolyte mixtures are investigated, along with the electrochemical performance of these electrolytes full‐cells based on hard carbon anodes and Prussian white cathodes with near‐commercial areal capacity (~2 mAh/cm2).",

        "abstract": "Layered sodium transition-metal (TM) oxides generally suffer from severe capacity decay and poor rate performance during cycling, especially at a high state of charge (SoC). Herein, an insight into failure mechanisms within high-voltage layered cathodes is unveiled, while a two-in-one tactic of charge localization and coherent structures is devised to improve structural integrity and Na+ transport kinetics, elucidated by density functional theory calculations. Elevated Jahn-Teller [Mn3+O6] concentration on the particle surface during sodiation, coupled with intense interlayer repulsion and adverse oxygen instability, leads to irreversible damage to the near-surface structure, as demonstrated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and in situ characterization techniques. It is further validated that the structural skeleton is substantially strengthened through the electronic structure modulation surrounding oxygen. Furthermore, optimized Na+ diffusion is effectively attainable via regulating intergrown structures, successfully achieved by the Zn2+ inducer. Greatly, good redox reversibility with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 92.6%, impressive rate capability (86.5 mAh g-1 with 70.4% retention at 10C), and enhanced cycling stability (71.6% retention after 300 cycles at 5C) are exhibited in the P2/O3 biphasic cathode.

Here, a high sustainability cobalt-free P2-Na0.72 Mn0.75 Li0.24 X0.01 O2  (X = Ti/Si) cathode is developed. The outstanding capacity retention and voltage retention after 150 cycles are obtained in half-cells. The finding shows that Ti localizes on the surface while Si diffuses to the bulk of the particles. Thus, Ti can act as a protective layer that alleviates side reactions in carbonate-based electrolyte. Meanwhile, Si can regulate the local electronic structure and suppress oxygen redox activities. Notably, full-cells with hard carbon (≈300-335 W h kg-1 based on the cathode mass) deliver the capacity retention of 83% for P2-Na0.72 Mn0.75 Li0.24 Si0.01 O2  and 66% for P2-Na0.72 Mn0.75 Li0.24 Ti0.01 O2  after 500 cycles; this electrochemical stability is the best compared to other reported cathodes based on oxygen redox at present.

Generally, the improved electronic conductivity and modified ionic diffusion kinetics resulting from K doping and MWCNT interconnecting endows the resultant Na3-xKxV2(PO4)3@C/MWCNT with modified electrochemical polarization and improved redox reversibility, contributing to superior performance at low temperatures. Generally, this study highlights the potential of alien substitution and carbon hybridization to improve the NASICON-type cathodes toward high-performance SIBs, especially at low temperatures.",

        "abstract": "Calcium ion batteries (CIBs) are considered as an important candidate for post‐lithium energy storage devices due to their abundance of resources and low cost. However, CIBs still suffer from slow kinetics due to the large solvation structure and high desolvation energy of Ca2+ ions. Here, a solvation regulation strategy based on donor number (DN) is reported to achieve easy‐desolvation and rapid storage of Ca2+ in sodium vanadate (Na2V6O16·2H2O, NVO). Specially, the solvent with a low DN, represented by propylene carbonate (PC), forms the first solvation shell of calcium ions with weak binding energy and small shell structure, which facilitates the migration of Ca2+ in the electrolyte. More importantly, the low DN solvent is preferentially desolvated at the cathode/electrolyte interface, promoting the insertion of Ca2+ into the NVO electrode. Mechanism studies further confirm the highly reversible uptake/release of Ca2+ in the NVO cathode, along with the VO distance change in the coordination structure. Therefore, the NVO cathode achieves high capacity (376 mAh g−1 at 0.3 A g−1) and high‐rate performance (151 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1). The weak solvation effect strategy further improves the electrochemical performance and provides great importance for the design of the long‐term development of CIBs.",

        "abstract": "Layer metal oxides demonstrate great commercial application potential in sodium-ion batteries, while their commercialization is extremely hampered by the unsatisfactory cycling performance caused by the irreversible phase transition and interfacial side reaction. Herein, trimethoxymethylsilane (TMSI) is introduced into electrolytes to construct an advanced cathode/electrolyte interphase by tuning the solvation structure of anions. It is found that due to the stronger interaction between ClO4- and TMSI than that of ClO4- and PC/FEC, the ClO4--TMSI complexes tend to accumulate on the surface of the cathode during the charging process, leading to the formation of a stable cathode/electrolyte interface (CEI). In addition, the Si species with excellent electronic insulation ability are distributed in the TMSI-derived CEI film, which is conducive to inhibiting the continuous side reaction of solvents and the growth of the CEI film. As a result, under a current density of 250 mA g-1, the capacity retention of the NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) cathode after 200 cycles in the TMSI-modified electrolyte is 74.4% in comparison to 51.5% of the bare electrolyte (1 M NaClO4/PC/5% FEC). Moreover, the NFM cathode shows better kinetics, with the specific discharge capacity increasing from 22 to 67 mAh g-1 at 300 mA g-1. It also demonstrates greatly improved rate capability, cycling stability, and Coulombic efficiency under various operating conditions, including high temperature (55 °C) and high cutoff voltage (2.0-4.3 V vs Na+/Na).",

        "abstract": "Iron-based mixed polyanion phosphate Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) is recognized as a promising cathode for Sodium-ion Batteries (SIBs) due to its low cost and environmental friendliness. However, its inherent low conductivity and sluggish Na+ diffusion limit fast charge and low-temperature sodium storage. This study pioneers a scalable synthesis of hollow core-shelled Na4Fe2.4Ni0.6(PO4)2P2O7 with tiny-void space (THoCS-0.6Ni) via a one-step spray-drying combined with calcination process due to the different viscosity, coordination ability, molar ratios, and shrinkage rates between citric acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone. This unique structure with interconnected carbon networks ensures rapid electron transport and fast Na+ diffusion, as well as efficient space utilization for relieve volume expansion. Incorporating regulation of lattice structure by doping Ni heteroatom to effectively improve intrinsic electron and Na+ diffusion path and energy barrier, which achieves fast charge and low-temperature sodium storage. As a result, THoCS-0.6Ni exhibits superior rate capability (86.4 mAh g-1 at 25 C). Notably, THoCS-0.6Ni demonstrates exceptional cycling stability at -20 °C with a capacity of 43.6 mAh g-1 after 2500 cycles at 5 C. This work provides a universal strategy to design the hollow core-shelled structure with tiny-void space cathode materials for reversible batteries with fast-charge and low-temperature storage features.",

        "abstract": "The electrochemical charge storage of sodium vanadate (NaV3O8 or NVO) cathodes in aqueous Zn-ion batteries has been hypothesized to be influenced by the inclusion of structural water for facilitating ion transfer in the material. Materials properties considered important (morphology, crystallite and particle size, surface area) are systematically studied herein through investigation of two NVO materials, NaV3O8·0.34H2O [NVO(300)] and NaV3O8·0.05H2O [NVO(500)], with different water content, acicular morphologies with different size and surface area achieved via post-synthesis heat treatment. The electrochemistry of the two materials was evaluated in aqueous Zn-ion cells with 2 M ZnSO4 electrolyte using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic cycling, and rate capability testing. The thinner NVO(300) nanobelts (0.13 μm) demonstrate greater specific capacities and higher effective diffusion coefficients relative to the thicker NVO(500) nanorods. Notably however, while cells containing NVO(500) deliver lower specific capacity, they demonstrate enhanced capacity retention with cycling. The structural changes accompanying oxidation and reduction are elucidated via ex situ X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and operando V K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), where NVO material properties are shown to influence the ion insertion. Operando XAS verified that electron transfer corresponds directly to change in vanadium oxidation state, affirming vanadium redox as the governing electrochemical process.",

This excellent behaviour was also evidenced when cycling at -15 °C. These results were confirmed by electrochemical techniques, such as cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy, that evidenced a fast exchange of sodium ions due to a significant capacitive contribution and high apparent diffusion coefficients. Post-mortem analysis of the F0N05 electrodes by XRD showed the reversible insertion and the absence of detrimental P2-O2 and P2-P2' transitions, while XPS spectra demonstrated the reversible redox activity of both transition metals and oxygen.",

Herein, a dense polyurethane-based GPE modified with polyacrylonitrile is synthesized by rapidly swelling two-component polyurethane/polyacrylonitrile electrospun fiber film. Compared to traditional porous GPEs obtained by swelling porous matrixes, the fiber film provides uniform high Na+ flux inside GPE due to its partial solubility property and ability to dissociate salts.

The study demonstrates that GPE has an ionic conductivity of 1.816 mS cm-1 at 20 °C and an ion transference number of 0.53.

        "abstract": "P2-type layered oxides based on the elements Fe and Mn have attracted great interest as sodium ion battery (SIB) cathode materials owing to their inexpensive metal constituents and high specific capacity. However, they suffer from rapid capacity fading and complicated phase transformations. In this study, we modulate the crystal structure and optimize the electrochemical performances of Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.5O2 by Al doping for Mn or Fe, respectively, and the roles of Al in the enhancement of the rate capability and cycling performance are unraveled. (1) The substitution of Al for Mn or Fe decreases the lattice parameters a and c but enlarges d spacing and lengthens Na-O bonds, which enhances Na+ diffusion and rate capability especially for Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.47Al0.03O2. (2) Al doping reduces the thickness of TMO2 and strengthens TM-O/O-O bonding. This enhances the layered structure stability and the capacity retention. (3) Al doping mitigates Mn3+ and Jahn-Teller distortion, mitigating the irreversible phase transition. (4) Al doping also alleviates the lattice volume variation and the structure strain. This further improves the stability of the layered structure and the cycling performances particularly in the case of Al doping for Fe. The in-depth insights into the roles of Al substitution might be also useful for designing high-performance cathode materials for SIBs through appropriate lattice doping.",

        "abstract": "Rechargeable batteries based on the most abundant elements, such as sodium and iron, have a great potential in the development of cost effective sodium ion batteries for large scale energy storage devices. We report, for the first time, crystallite size dependent structural investigations on maricite-NaFePO4 through X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical simulations. Rietveld refinement analysis on the X-ray diffraction data reveals that a decrease in the unit cell parameters leads to volume contraction upon reduction in the crystallite size. Further, the atomic multiplet simulations on X-ray absorption spectra provide unequivocally a change in the site symmetry of transition metal ions. The high resolution oxygen K-edge spectra reveal a substantial change in the bonding character with the reduction of crystallite size, which is the fundamental cause for the change in the unit cell parameters of maricite-NaFePO4. In parallel, we performed first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations on maricite-NaFePO4 with different sodium ion vacancy concentrations. The obtained structural parameters are in excellent agreement with the experimental observations on the mesostructured maricite-NaFePO4. The volumetric changes with respect to crystallite size are related to the compressive strain, resulting in the improvement in the electronic diffusivity. The nano-crystalline maricite-NaFePO4 with improved kinetics will open a new avenue for its usage as a cathode material in sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Mn-based Prussian blue analogues (PBA) are of great interest as a prospective cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high redox potential, easy synthesis and low cost. However, the Jahn-Teller effect and low electrical conductivity of Mn-based PBA causes poor structure stability and unsatisfactory performance during the cycling. Herein, we develop a novel Ni and Cu co-doped K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] cathode via a simple co-precipitation strategy. The doping elements improve the electrical conductivity of Mn-based PBA by reducing the bandgap, as well as suppress the Jahn-Teller effect by stabilizing the framework, as verified by the density functional theory calculations. Simultaneously, the substitution of sodium with potassium in the lattice is beneficial for filling vacancies in the PBA framework, leading to higher average operating voltages and superior structural stability. As a result, the as-prepared Mn-based cathode exhibits excellent reversible capacity (116.0 mAh g-1 at 0.01 A g-1) and superior cycling stability (81.8% capacity retention over 500 cycles at 0.1 A g-1).

However, rapid capacity fading, and poor rate performance caused by serious structural changes and interfacial degradation hamper their use. In this study, a NaPO3 surface modified O3-type layered NaNi1/3 Fe1/3 Mn1/3 O2 cathode is synthesized, with improved high-voltage stability through protecting layer against acid attack, which is achieved by a solid-gas reaction between the cathode particles and gaseous P2 O5 . The NaPO3 nanolayer on the surface effectively stabilizes the crystal structure by inhibiting surface parasitic reactions and increasing the observed average voltage. Superior cyclic stability is exhibited by the surface-modified cathode (80.1% vs 63.6%) after 150 cycles at 1 C in the wide voltage range of 2.0 V-4.2 V (vs Na+ /Na). Moreover, benefiting from the inherent ionic conduction of NaPO3 , the surface-modified cathode presents excellent rate capability (103 mAh g-1  vs 60 mAh g-1 ) at 10 C.

        "abstract": "The two‐phase reaction of Na3V2(PO4)3 – Na1V2(PO4)3 in Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is hindered by low electronic and ionic conductivity. To address this problem, a surface‐N‐doped NVP encapsulating by N‐doped carbon nanocage (N‐NVP/N‐CN) is rationally constructed, wherein the nitrogen is doped in both the surface crystal structure of NVP and carbon layer. The surface crystal modification decreases the energy barrier of Na+ diffusion from bulk to electrolyte, enhances intrinsic electronic conductivity, and releases lattice stress. Meanwhile, the porous architecture provides more active sites for redox reactions and shortens the diffusion path of ion. Furthermore, the new interphase of Na2V2(PO4)3 is detected by in situ XRD and clarified by density functional theory (DFT) calculation with a lower energy barrier during the fast reversible electrochemical three‐phase reaction of Na3V2(PO4)3 – Na2V2(PO4)3 – Na1V2(PO4)3. Therefore, as cathode of sodium‐ion battery, the N‐NVP/N‐CN exhibited specific capacities of 119.7 and 75.3 mAh g−1 at 1 C and even 200 C. Amazingly, high capacities of 89.0, 86.2, and 84.6 mAh g−1 are achieved after overlong 10000 cycles at 20, 40, and 50 C, respectively. This approach provides a new idea for surface crystal modification to cast intermediate Na2V2(PO4)3 phase for achieving excellent cycling stability and rate capability.",

Electrolyte composition, which plays an indispensable and critical role in determining cycle stability and electrode/electrolyte interfacial properties, are of great significance to possess good compatibility with electrode materials, especially NVPF1+2x. Here, different electrolyte systems, including commonly used 1.0 M NaPF6/diglyme (NP-005), 1.0 M NaPF6 /propylene carbonate (PC)/5.0% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) (NP-009), 1.0 M NaClO4 /ethylene carbonate-dimethyl carbonate (EC-DMC) =1: 1 Vol%/5.0% FEC (NC-019) and 1.0 M NaClO4 /PC (NC-013), are systematically investigated and compared for NVPF1+2x cathode. NVPF1+2x  with NP-009 shows a more superior cycle stability and rate capability at 1 C~10 C (1 C=130 mA g -1 ) than that of NC-019 and NC-013 while NVPF1+2x  with NP-005 shows the best high-rate capability at 20 C~50 C.  It demonstrates that NVPF1+2x  with NP-005 exhibits a thin, efficient and NaF-rich CEI layer with less polarization, smaller interfacial resistance and faster Na+ diffusion than that of NC-019 and NC-013 since they suffered from a thick, over-grown CEI layer due to the consecutive decomposition of FEC, NaClO4 and/or linear DMC.

In the cathode materials of aqueous zinc ion batteries with long life and high capacity, abundant active sites and crystal structure stability play an important role. In the present work, the strategy of Na+ intercalation of Fe2VO4 (FVO) is proposed, aiming at the insertion of Na+, which not only enriches the active sites, but also sodium and iron ions act as guest species with the negatively charged VOx lattice to provide strong electrostatic attraction to stabilize the lamellar structure. In terms of electrochemical performance, the discharge specific capacity is 370 mAh g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1, and when the current density is arising 5 A g-1, the specific capacity also reaches 200 mAh g-1 after cycling 2000 with a capacity retention of 99%, which is better than the electrochemical performance of Fe2VO4 (FVO) alone at 50 mAh g-1.

        "abstract": "Layered cathodes have been recognized as potential advanced candidates for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), but the poor electrochemical performance has seriously hindered their further development. Herein, an ordered Na2/3[Ni2/9Mg1/9Mn5/9Ti1/9]O2 (NMMT) is designed and investigated as a high-performance cathode for SIBs through the synergistic effect of Mg and Ti codoping. Compared to the single Mg- or Ti-doped materials, NMMT clearly exhibits superstructure ordering diffraction peaks, and neutron diffraction further confirms that the diffraction peaks can be well indexed by a larger supercell P63, rather than the common unit cell P63/mmc by X-ray diffraction (XRD). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy also approves the ordering arrangement. This material shows an obvious capacity activation process during the first cycles, thus delivering 113 mA h g-1 specific capacity at 0.1 C (close to the theoretical value). Excellent rate capability even at 15 C and cycling stability after 500 cycles between 2.0 and 4.3 V can also be achieved, indicating that an ordered cathode is still promising. Besides, a single-phase reaction mechanism is revealed by ex situ/in situ XRD experiments.

        "abstract": "Rechargeable aqueous zinc‐ion batteries are of great potential as one of the next‐generation energy‐storage devices due to their low cost and high safety. However, the development of long‐term stable electrodes and electrolytes still suffers from great challenges. Herein, a self‐separation strategy is developed for an interface layer design to optimize both electrodes and electrolytes simultaneously. Specifically, the coating with an organometallics (sodium tricyanomethanide) evolves into an electrically responsive shield layer composed of nitrogen, carbon‐enriched polymer network, and sodium ions, which not only modulates the zinc‐ion migration pathways to inhibit interface side reactions but also adsorbs onto Zn perturbations to induce planar zinc deposition. Additionally, the separated ions from the coating can diffuse to the electrolyte to affect the Zn2+ solvation structure and maintain the cathode structural stability by forming a stable cathode–electrolyte interface and sodium ions’ equilibrium, confirmed by in situ spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis. Due to these unique advantages, the symmetric zinc batteries exhibit an extralong cycling lifespan of 3000 h and rate performance at 20 mA cm−2 at wide temperatures. The efficiency of the self‐separation strategy is further demonstrated in practical full batteries with an ultralong lifespan over 10 000 cycles from −35 to 60 °C.",

Here, we report a new class of cathode materials Na6MS4 (M = Co, Mn, Fe, and Zn) that exhibit high charge-storage capacity. Using Na6CoS4 as a prototypical example, we observe a six-electron conversion reaction dominated by anion redox, confirmed through various electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques. After the initial cycle, Na6CoS4 delivers a high capacity of 392 mA h g-1 with a long lifespan of over 500 cycles. The reaction involves initially the transformation of crystalline Na6CoS4 to a nearly amorphous structure consisting of mainly CoS and sulfur nanoparticles, which then reversibly cycles between nearly amorphous a-CoS/S and a-Na6CoS4. Such anion-redox-driven conversion-type cathodes hold the potential to enable energy-dense, stable SIBs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "P2-type Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.5O2 (MF) has attracted great interest as a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high specific capacity and low cost. However, its poor cyclic stability and rate performance hinder its practical applications, which is largely related to lattice oxygen instability. Here, we propose to coat the cathode of SIBs with Li2ZrO3, which realizes the \"three-in-one\" modification of Li2ZrO3 coating and Li+, Zr4+ co-doping. The synergy of Li2ZrO3 coating and Li+/Zr4+ doping improves both the cycle stability and rate performance, and the underlying modification mechanism is revealed by a series of characterization methods. The doping of Zr4+ increases the interlayer spacing of MF, reduces the diffusion barrier of Na+, and reduces the ratio of Mn3+/Mn4+, thus inhibiting the Jahn-Teller effect. The Li2ZrO3 coating layer inhibits the side reaction between the cathode and the electrolyte. The synergy of Li2ZrO3 coating and Li+, Zr4+ co-doping enhances the stability of lattice oxygen and the reversibility of anionic redox, which improves the cycle stability and rate performance. This study provides some insights into stabilizing the lattice oxygen in layered oxide cathodes for high-performance SIBs.",

        "abstract": "O3-type layered oxides are highly promising cathodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), however they undergo complex phase transitions and exhibit high sensibility to air, leading to subpar cycling performance and commercial viability. In this work, we report a layered cathode material (NaNi0.29Cu0.1Mg0.05Li0.05Mn0.2Ti0.2Sn0.11O2) with a sate-of-the-art high-entropy compositional design. We unveil that such a configuration featuring inhomogeneous coordination environment of transition metal (TM) elements, can enable enhanced gliding energy (-0.38 vs -0.58 eV) of TMO2 slabs upon desodiation both theoretically and experimentally, which underlies the fundamental origin of the outstanding structural stability of HEO materials. As a consequence, the complex phase transitions (O3-O'3-P3-P'3-P3'-O3') of conventional O3-type cathode have been eliminated, and the as-obtained material demonstrates exceptional structural robustness and integrity with an ultra-long cycle life in a quasi-solid-state cell (maintaining 73.2% capacity after 1000 cycles at 2 C). Moreover, the material presents satisfactory air stability, with minimal structural and electrochemical degradation when directly exposed to the air.

In this study, we systematically investigated the failure mechanisms of P3 cathodes, encompassing Mn dissolution, migration, and the irreversible P3-O3' phase transition, culminating in severe structural collapse. To address these challenges, we proposed an interfacial spinel local interlocking strategy utilizing P3/spinel intergrowth oxide as a proof-of-concept material. As a result, P3/spinel intergrowth oxide cathodes demonstrated enhanced cycling performance. The effectiveness of suppressing Mn migration and maintaining local structure of interfacial spinel local interlocking strategy was validated through depth-etching X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and in situ synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction. This interfacial spinel local interlocking engineering strategy presents a promising avenue for the development of advanced cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The development of secondary batteries based on abundant and cheap elements is vital. Among various alternatives to conventional lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are promising due to the abundant resources and low cost of sodium. While there are many challenges associated with the SIB system, cathode is an important factor in determining the electrochemical performance of this battery system. Accordingly, ongoing research in the field of SIBs is inclined towards the development of safe, cost effective cathode materials having improved performance. In particular, pyrophosphate cathodes have recently demonstrated decent electrochemical performance and thermal stability. Herein, we report the synthesis, electrochemical properties, and thermal behavior of a novel Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 cathode for SIBs. The material was synthesized through a solid state process. The structural analysis reveals that the mixed substitution of manganese and iron has resulted in a triclinic crystal structure (P1[combining macron] space group). Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements indicate that Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 is electrochemically active with a reversible capacity of ∼80 mA h g(-1) at a C/20 rate with an average redox potential of 3.2 V. (vs. Na/Na(+)). It is noticed that 84% of initial capacity is preserved over 90 cycles showing promising cyclability. It is also noticed that the rate capability of Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 is better than Na2MnP2O7. Ex situ and CV analyses indicate that Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 undergoes a single phase reaction rather than a biphasic reaction due to different Na coordination environment and different Na site occupancy when compared to other pyrophosphate materials (Na2FeP2O7 and Na2MnP2O7). Thermogravimetric analysis (25-550 °C) confirms good thermal stability of Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 with only 2% weight loss. Owing to promising electrochemical properties and decent thermal stability, Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7, can be an attractive cathode for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Since Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) possesses modest volume deformation and three-dimensional ion diffusion channels, it is a potential sodium-ion battery cathode material that has been extensively researched. Nonetheless, NVP still endures the consequences of poor electronic conductivity and low voltage platforms, which need to be further improved. On this basis, a high voltage platform Na3V2(PO4)2F3 was introduced to form a composite with NVP to increase the energy density. In this study, the sol–gel technique was successfully used to synthesize a Na3V2(PO4)2.75F0.75/C (NVPF·3NVP/C) composite cathode material. The citric acid-derived carbon layer was utilized to construct three-dimensional conducting networks to effectively promote ion and electron diffusion. Furthermore, the composites' synergistic effect accelerates the quick ionic migration and improves the kinetic reaction. In particular, NVP as the dominant phase enhanced the structural stability and significantly increased the capacitive contribution. Therefore, at 0.1C, the discharge capacity of the modified NVPF·3NVP/C composite is 120.7 mA h g−1, which is greater than the theoretical discharge capacity of pure NVP (118 mA h g−1). It discharged 110.9 mA h g−1 of reversible capacity even at an elevated multiplicity of 10C, and after 200 cycles, it retained 64.1% of its capacity. Thus, the effort produced an optimized NVPF·3NVP/C composite cathode material that may be used in the sodium ion cathode.",

        "title": "Enabling Anionic Redox Stability of P2‐Na5/6Li1/4Mn3/4O2 by Mg Substitution",
        "abstract": "Oxygen‐based anionic redox reactions have recently emerged as a lever to increase the capacity of Mn‐rich layered oxide cathodes in addition to the charge compensation based on cationic redox reactions for sodium‐ion batteries. Unfortunately, the irreversibility of anionic redox often aggravates irreversible structure change and poor cycling performance. Here, a stable anionic redox is achieved through substituting Na ions by Mg ions in P2‐type Na0.83Li0.25Mn0.75O2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Mg substitution effectively decreases the oxygen chemical potential, causing an improvement in lattice oxygen stability. Moreover, at a highly desodiated state, Mg ions that remain in the lattice and interact with O 2p orbitals can decrease the undercoordinated oxygen and the nonbonded, electron‐deficient O 2p states, facilitating the reversibility of oxygen redox. When cycled in the voltage range of 2.6–4.5 V where only anionic redox occurs for charge compensation, Na0.773Mg0.03Li0.25Mn0.75O2 presents a much better reversibility, giving a 4 times better cycle stability than that of Na0.83Li0.25Mn0.75O2. Experimentally, Na0.773Mg0.03Li0.25Mn0.75O2 exhibits a ≈1.1% volume expansion during sodium insertion/extraction, suggestive of a “zero‐strain” cathode. Overall, the work opens a new avenue for enhancing anionic reversibility of oxygen‐related Mn‐rich cathodes.",

        "abstract": "Sodium layered oxides always suffer from sluggish kinetics and deleterious phase transformations at deep-desodiation state (i.e., >4.0 V) in O3 structure, incurring inferior rate capability and grievous capacity degradation. To tackle these handicaps, here, a configurational entropy tuning protocol through manipulating the stoichiometric ratios of inactive cations is proposed to elaborately design Na-deficient, O3-type NaxTmO2 cathodes. It is found that the electrons surrounding the oxygen of the TmO6 octahedron are rearranged by the introduction of MnO6 and TiO6 octahedra in Na-deficient O3-type Na0.83Li0.1Ni0.25Co0.2Mn0.15Ti0.15Sn0.15O2-δ (MTS15) with expanded O-Na-O slab spacing, giving enhanced Na+ diffusion kinetics and structural stability, as disclosed by theoretical calculations and electrochemical measurements. Concomitantly, the entropy effect contributes to the improved reversibility of Co redox and phase-transition behaviors between O3 and P3, as clearly revealed by ex situ synchrotron X-ray absorption spectra and in situ X-ray diffraction. Notably, the prepared entropy-tuned MTS15 cathode exhibits impressive rate capability (76.7% capacity retention at 10 C), cycling stability (87.2% capacity retention after 200 cycles) with a reversible capacity of 109.4 mAh g-1, good full-cell performance (84.3% capacity retention after 100 cycles), and exceptional air stability.

Particularly, their rate performance was significantly improved as well. XRD and XPS tests indicated that La could expand the c-axis of NFM due to its larger ionic radius and thus significantly increased Na+ ion diffusion efficiency, and in addition, Al doping could effectively increase the content of Ni2+ and Mn4+ and thus greatly alleviated the negative Jahn-Teller effect caused by Mn3+.

The optimized sample exhibited a high-rate capacity of 71.8 mAh g-1 at 30 C (83.1% capacity retention after 1000 cycles) and excellent performance over a wide temperature range (84.1 mAh g-1 at 60 °C and 61.4 mAh g-1 at -30 °C). In situ X-ray diffraction technology confirmed a redox solid solution and a two-phase reaction mechanism, revealing minor changes in cell volume and slight strain variations after Zr doping, effectively suppressing the structural distortion. Theoretical calculations illustrated that Zr doping largely shrinks the band gap of NMVP, enriches local electron density, and slightly alters the local element distribution and bond lengths. Moreover, full-cells have shown high energy density (259.9 Wh kg-1) and outstanding cycling stability (200 cycles). The work provides fresh insights into the synergistic effect of strain suppressing and interface engineering in promoting the development of wide temperature range and long-calendar-life SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) have been considered as potential candidates for stationary energy storage because of the low cost and wide availability of Na sources. O3‐type layered oxides have been considered as one of the most promising cathodes for SIBs. However, they commonly show inevitable complicated phase transitions and sluggish kinetics, incurring rapid capacity decline and poor rate capability. Here, a series of sodium‐sufficient O3‐type NaNi0.5Mn0.5‐ x Ti x O2 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) cathodes for SIBs is reported and the mechanisms behind their excellent electrochemical performance are studied in comparison to those of their respective end‐members. The combined analysis of in situ X‐ray diffraction, ex situ X‐ray absorption spectroscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy for NaNi0.5Mn0.2Ti0.3O2 reveals that the O3‐type phase transforms reversibly into a P3‐type phase upon Na+ deintercalation/intercalation. The substitution of Ti for Mn enlarges interslab distance and could restrain the unfavorable and irreversible multiphase transformation in the high voltage regions that is usually observed in O3‐type NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2, resulting in improved Na cell performance. This integration of macroscale and atomicscale engineering strategy might open up the modulation of the chemical and physical properties in layered oxides and grasp new insight into the optimal design of high‐performance cathode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "High-voltage layered oxide cathodes attract great attention for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to the potential high energy density, but high voltage usually leads to rapid capacity decay. Herein, a stable high-voltage NaLi0.1Ni0.35Mn0.3Ti0.25O2 cathode with a ribbon-ordered superlattice is reported, and the intrinsic coupling mechanism between structure evolution and the anion redox reaction (ARR) is revealed. Li introduction constructs a special Li-O-Na configuration activating reversible nonbonded O 2p (|O2p)-type ARR and regulates the structure evolution way, enabling the reversible Li ions out-of-layer migration instead of the irreversible transition metal ions out-of-layer migration. The reversible structure evolution enhances the reversibility of the bonded O 2p (O2p)-type ARR and inhibits the generation of oxygen dimers, thus suppressing the irreversible molecular oxygen (O2)-type ARR. After the structure regulation, the structure evolution becomes reversible, |O2p-type ARR is activated, O2p-type ARR becomes stable, and O2-type ARR is inhibited, which largely suppresses the capacity degradation and voltage decay. The discharge capacity is increased from 154 to 168 mA h g-1, the capacity retention after 200 cycles significantly increases from 35 to 84%, and the voltage retention increases from 78 to 93%.

        "abstract": "Rechargeable sodium-iodine and lithium-iodine batteries have been demonstrated to be promising and scalable energy-storage devices, but their development has been seriously limited by challenges such as their inferior stability and the poor kinetics of iodine. Anchoring iodine to 3D porous carbon is an effective strategy to overcome these defects; however, both the external architecture and internal microstructure of the 3D porous carbon host can greatly affect the ion intercalation of iodine/C electrodes. To realize the full potential of iodine electrodes, a biochemistry-enabled route was developed to enable the controllable design of different 3D porous architectures, from hollow microspheres to 3D foam, for use in iodine/C cathodes. Two types of spores with spherical cells, i.e. Cibotium Barometz (C. Barometz) and Oetes Sinesis (O. Sinesis), are employed as bio-precursors. By carefully controlling the degree of damage on the bio-precursors, different targeted carbon hosts were fabricated. Systematic studies were carried out to clarify the structural effects on modifying the ion-intercalation capabilities of the iodine/C cathodes in lithium-iodine and sodium-iodine batteries. Our results demonstrate the profound performance improvements of both 3D bio-foam and hollow sphere because their hierarchically porous structures can strongly immobilize iodine. Notably, the 3D bio-foam based iodine composites achieve faster ion kinetics and enhanced rate capability than their hollow sphere based counterparts. This was attributed to their higher micro/mesopore volume, larger surface area and improved packing density, which result in the highly efficient adsorption of iodine species. By virtue of the thinnest slices, the iodine/bio-foam derived from C. Barometz spores achieves the best high-rate long-term cycling capability, which retains 94% and 91% of their capacities in lithium-iodine and sodium-iodine batteries after 500 cycles, respectively. With the help of the biochemistry-assisted technique, our study provides a much-needed fundamental insight for the rational design of 3D porous iodine/C composites, which will promote a significant research direction for the practical application of lithium/sodium-iodine batteries.",

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is regarded as a promising cathode material for sodium ion batteries (NIBs) because of its 3D open structure suitable for Na insertion/extraction and high energy density. However, the NVP suffers from poor electrical conductivity, which restricts the rate performance and the long cycle performance of the NVP for NIBs. Here, the NVP particles embedded in the N,S co-doped 3D porous carbon matrix (denoted as NVP@3D-NSC) were prepared by a facile process. The NVP@3D-NSC can deliver high specific discharge capacities at high rates (54 mA h g-1 at 80 C). It exhibits a super long cycle life exceeding 6000 cycles (75 mA h g-1 at 20 C after 6000 cycles) and a low capacity-decay rate of 0.36% per cycle. The excellent electrochemical performance of the NVP@3D-NSC is attributed to the specific architecture of the material that combines a variety of advantages: a very short diffusion length of Na+/e- in small NVP particles, a high contact area between the electrolyte and electrode, and a 3D porous structure buffering the volume change during cycling. In addition, the N,S co-doped porous carbon matrix can not only improve the electrical conductivity, but also create some extrinsic defects and active sites, which can enhance the diffusion rate of sodium ions.",

Layered vanadium oxides are regarded as the promising candidates for SIBs because of their large interlayer spacing, high theoretical specific capacity, abundant sources and low cost. In this paper, a vanadium oxide hydrate (H2V3O8) nanowire membrane is presented as a flexible cathode for SIBs without addition of any other additives (binders or conductive compounds). Such a freestanding flexible membrane exhibits a high specific capacity of 168 mA h g(-1) at 10 mA g(-1), and its high capacity is maintained well after 100 cycles. It is found that the capacitive charge storage accounts for a relatively large proportion of the total capacity, whereas the crystal structure of H2V3O8 is highly reversible during the sodiation/desodiation processes. This research demonstrates that the H2V3O8 nanowire is an exceptional candidate for SIBs.",

However, the undesired P2-O2 phase transition at high voltages above 4.0 V leads to a large volume change and further causes the rapid decay of capacity. Herein, an electrochemical-active Co3+ substitution is introduced to suppress the P2-O2 phase transformation but not at the cost of capacity. The spherical, Co3+ substituted P2-Na2/3[Ni0.3Co0.1Mn0.6]O2 with a high tap-density of 1.86 g cm-3 is successfully synthesized by co-precipitation and solid-state reactions. As anticipated, it delivers a large specific capacity of 161.6 mA h g-1 with a high median-voltage of 3.64 V (vs. Na/Na+), translated into a high energy-density of ∼590 W h kg-1, which is comparable to that of the commercialized LiCoO2 cathode in lithium-ion batteries. Apart from improved cycling stability ascribed to the mitigated P2-O2 transition, this cathode also shows a better rate property compared with those modified by Li+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, and Ti4+ doping and Al2O3 coating. Besides, the P2-Na2/3[Ni0.3Co0.1Mn0.6]O2|hard carbon full-cells deliver a reversible capacity of 150.6 mA h g-1 and have enhanced cycle-life and high-rate capability.

        "abstract": "Layered Na-based oxides with the general composition of NaxTMO2 (TM: transition metal) have attracted significant attention for their high compositional diversity that provides tunable electrochemical performance for electrodes in sodium-ion batteries. The various compositions bring forward complex structural chemistry that is decisive for the layered stacking structure, Na-ion conductivity, and the redox activity, potentially promising new avenues in functional material properties. In this work, we have explored the maximum Na content in P2-type layered oxides and discovered that the high-content Na in the host enhances the structural stability; moreover, it promotes the oxidation of low-valent cations to their high oxidation states (in this case Ni2+). This can be rationalized by the increased hybridization of the O(2p)-TM(3d-eg*) states, affecting both the local TM environment as well as the interactions between the NaO2 and TMO2 layers. These properties are highly beneficial for the Na storage capabilities as required for cathode materials in sodium-ion batteries. It leads to excellent Na-ion mobility, a large storage capacity (>100 mAh g–1 between 2.0-4.0 V), yet preventing the detrimental sliding of the TMO2 layers (P2–O2 structural transition), as reflected by the ultralong cycle life (3000 (dis)charge cycles demonstrated). These findings expand the horizons of high Na-content P2-type materials, providing new insights of the electronic and structural chemistry for advanced cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the development of cathode materials for Na-ion batteries has gained much attention due to the abundance, low cost, and easy availability of resources. Apart from the usual metal oxides, multi-electron redox materials grabbed attention due to their high energy density and practical capacity with long cycle life. Polyoxometalates (POMs) are inorganic clusters of higher valent metals, and act as electron sponges with multi-electron redox properties. Herein we report a Keggin-type polyoxometalate [PMo10V2O40]5− with Na+ and H+ counter cations as a cathode material for Na-ion batteries. Further the formation of POM is evidenced by PXRD, FT-IR, flame photometry and XPS studies. In Na-POM, Na+ ions in the intercluster cavities provide a better pathway and easy diffusion during the charge/discharge process, and contribute to better electrochemical properties than H-POM. The DFT studies further explore the detailed mechanistic pathway of Na+ ions around the clusters in the normal and super-reduced states. Na-POM enables better cycling stability and capacity retention with a specific discharge capacity of 123 mA h g−1 at 0.1C rate at room temperature.",

        "abstract": "Undesired reactions between layered sodium transition-metal oxide cathodes and air impede their utilization in practical sodium-ion batteries. Consequently, a fundamental understanding of how layered oxide cathodes degrade in air is of paramount importance, but it has not been fully understood yet. Here a comprehensive study on a model material NaNi0.7Mn0.15Co0.15O2 reveals its reaction chemistry with air and the dynamic evolution of the degradation species upon air exposure. We find that besides the extraction of Na+ ions from the crystal lattice to form NaOH, Na2CO3, and Na2CO3·H2O in contact with air, nickel ions gradually dissolve from the bulk to form NiO and accumulate on the particle surface as revealed by subnanometer surface-sensitive time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy. The degradation species on the surface are insulating, leading to an increase in interfacial resistance and declined electrochemical performance. We also demonstrate a feasible surface coating strategy for suppressing the unfavorable degradation process. Understanding the degradation mechanism at a nanoscale can facilitate the future development of high-energy cathodes for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Substituting electrochemically active elements such as Li and Mg in P2-type layered sodium oxide is an effective strategy for developing competitive cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. However, the lack of atomic-level understanding regarding the distribution of substitution positions complicates the comprehension of the roles of substituting atoms and the mechanism of sodium-ion intercalation. In this study, we identified the stable configurations of Na in Na0.75Ni0.3Mn0.7O2 and Na0.75Li0.15Mg0.05Ni0.1Mn0.7O2 materials using the site exclusion method. Through simulating the complete charging process for both materials, the structure evolution of the cathodes during the cycling and the impact of the partial substitution of Ni elements by Li and Mg atoms were comprehensively elucidated. Our findings revealed that Mg atoms effectively regulate the distribution of forces within the materials, essentially serving as supportive pillars within the cathode. Meanwhile, Li atoms efficiently mitigated electron localization, consequently diminishing volume fluctuations during the charging process. More importantly, the substitution with Li and Mg atoms could synergistically reduce the interaction between transition metals and sodium ions, thereby reducing the diffusion energy barrier of Na ions. This study not only enhances the comprehension of substituted metal atoms in P2 layered oxides but also offers new insights for the development of sodium-ion cathode materials.",

The rational design, synthesis, and characterization of a complex heterotrimetallic single-source molecular precursor for the next generation sodium-ion battery cathode material, Na2Mn2FeO6, is described. A unique pentametallic platform [MnII(ptac)3-Na-MnIII(acac)3-Na-MnII(ptac)3] (1) was derived from the known polymeric structure of [NaMnII(acac)3]∞, through a series of elaborate design procedures, such as mixed-ligand, unsymmetric ligand, and mixed-valent approaches. Importantly, the application of those techniques results in a molecule with distinctively different transition metal positions in terms of ligand environment and oxidation states. An isovalent substitution of FeIII for the central MnIII ion forms the target heterotrimetallic precursor [MnII(ptac)3-Na-FeIII(acac)3-Na-MnII(ptac)3] (3) with an appropriate metal ratio of Na:Mn:Fe = 2:2:1. The arrangement of metal ions and ligands in this pentametallic assembly was confirmed by single crystal X-ray investigation. The unambiguous assignment of the positions and oxidation states of the Periodic Table neighbors Fe and Mn in 3 has been achieved by a combination of investigative techniques that include synchrotron resonant diffraction, X-ray multiwavelength anomalous diffraction, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, Mössbauer spectroscopy, and gas-phase DART mass spectrometry.

A water-insoluble polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) binder has been widely applied for an aqueous battery, in which the toxic and expensive organic solvent of N-methy-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) is required during the coating process. Herein, we report that the water-soluble SA can be utilized as a binder in aqueous Zn batteries because SA could cross-link with the Zn2+ ion to form a water-insoluble and mechanically super strong binder for electrodes. Aqueous Zn||LiFePO4 cells are assembled to demonstrate the performance of the SA binder for LiFePO4 cathodes. Due to the high adhesion strength of cross-linked Zn-SA, LiFePO4 with the SA binder displays a high capacity retention of 93.7% with a high Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% after 100 cycles at a 0.2 C rate, while the capacity of LiFePO4 with the PVDF binder quickly decays to 84.7% after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. In addition, the LiFePO4 cathode with the SA binder also has smaller redox polarization, faster ion diffusion rate, and more favorable electrochemical kinetics than that with the PVDF binder.",

With respect to PB cathodes, however, their intrinsic crystal regularity, vacancies, and coordinated water will lead to low specific capacity and poor rate performance, impeding their application. Herein, nanocubic porous Nax FeFe(CN)6 coated with polydopamine (PDA) as a coupling layer to improve its electrochemical performance is reported, inspired by the excellent adhesive property of PDA. As a cathode for sodium-ion batteries, the Nax FeFe(CN)6 electrode coupled with PDA delivers a reversible capacity of 93.8 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 0.2 A g-1 , and a discharge capacity of 72.6 mA h g-1 at 5.0 A g-1 . The sodium storage mechanism of this Nax FeFe(CN)6 coupled with PDA is revealed via in situ Raman spectroscopy. The first-principles computational results indicate that FeII sites in PB prefer to couple with the robust PDA layer to stabilize the PB structure. Moreover, the sodium-ion migration in the PB structure is enhanced after coating with PDA, thus improving the sodium storage properties.

Herein, we propose a topotactic epitaxy process to generate K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] (KMF) submicron octahedra and assemble them into octahedral superstructures (OSs) by tuning the kinetics of topotactic transformation. As the SIB cathode, the self-assembly behavior of KMF improves the structural stability and decreases the contact area with the electrolyte, thereby inhibiting the transition metal in the KMF cathode from dissolving in the electrolyte. More importantly, the KMF partly transforms into NMF with Na+ de/intercalation, and the existing KMF acts as a stabilizer to disrupt the long-range JT order of NMF, thereby suppressing the overall JT distortion. As a result, the electrochemical performances of KMF cathodes outperform NMF with a highly reversible phase transition and outstanding cycling performance, and 80% capacity retention after 1500/1300 cycles at 0.1/0.5 A g-1.

        "abstract": "P2-phase layered cathodes play a pivotal role in sodium-ion batteries due to their efficient Na+ intercalation chemistry. However, limited by crystal disintegration and interfacial instability, bulk and interfacial failure plague their electrochemical performance. To address these challenges, a structural enhancement combined with surface modification is achieved through trace Y doping. Based on a synergistic combination of experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the introduction of partial Y ions at the Na site (2d) acts as a stabilizing pillar, mitigating the electrostatic repulsions between adjacent TMO2 slabs and thereby relieving internal structural stress. Furthermore, the presence of Y effectively optimizes the Ni 3d-O 2p hybridization, resulting in enhanced electronic conductivity and a notable rapid charging ability, with a capacity of 77.3 mA h g-1 at 40 C. Concurrently, the introduction of Y also induces the formation of perovskite nano-islands, which serve to minimize side reactions and modulate interfacial diffusion. As a result, the refined P2-Na0.65 Y0.025 [Ni0.33 Mn0.67 ]O2 cathode material exhibits an exceptionally low volume variation (≈1.99%), an impressive capacity retention of 83.3% even at -40 °C after1500 cycles at 1 C.",

Here, an ultra-stable and ultra-thin perylene-dicyandiamide-based hydrogen organic framework (HOF) nanosheet (P-DCD) of ≈3.5 nm in thickness is developed. When applied in the cathode, the P-DCD exhibits exceptional long-term capacity retention for alkali-ion batteries (AIBs). Strikingly, for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), at current of 2 A g-1 , the large reversible capacity of 108 mA h g-1 shows no attenuation within 5 000 cycles. For sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), the related capacity retains 91.7% within 10 000 cycles compared to the initial state, significantly much more stable than conventional organic materials reported previously. Mechanism studies through ex situ and in situ experiments and theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the impressive long-term performance retention originates from the large electron delocalization, fast ion diffusion, and physicochemical stability within the ultra-thin 2D P-DCD, featuring π-π and hydrogen bonding stacking, nitrogen-rich units, and low impedance.

Herein, the composite materials of manganese-iron based Prussian white and reduced graphene oxide (PW/rGO) were synthesized via a one-step in situ synthesis method with sodium citrate, which was employed both as a chelating agent to control the reaction rate during the coprecipitation process of PW synthesis and as a reducing agent for GO. The low precipitation speed helps minimize lattice defects, while rGO enhances electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the one-step in situ synthesis method is simpler and more efficient than the traditional synthesis method. Compared with pure PW, the PW/rGO composites exhibit significantly improved electrochemical properties. Cycling performance tests indicated that the PW/rGO-10 sample exhibited the highest initial discharge capacity and the best cyclic stability. The PW/rGO-10 has an initial discharge capacity of 128 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C (1 C = 170 mA g-1), and retains 49.53% capacity retention after 100 cycles, while the PW only delivers 112 mAh g-1 with a capacity retention of 17.79% after 100 cycles. Moreover, PW/rGO-10 also shows better rate performance and higher sodium ion diffusion coefficient (DNa+) than the PW sample. Therefore, the incorporation of rGO not only enhances the electrical conductivity but also promotes the rapid diffusion of sodium ions, effectively improving the electrochemical performance of the composite as a cathode material for sodium-ion batteries.",

Evaluation of the viscosity, conductivity, and thermal and electrochemical stabilities resulted in clear structure-property relationships, rendering the ether functionalized RTILs most promising for application in SIBs. Electrochemical investigations of the ether functionalized IL electrolytes in SIB half cells (Na0.6Mn0.9Co0.1O2 as cathode material) proved their compatibility with a SIB system. Stable cycling performance was achieved with the piperidinium based RTIL IL 6 outperforming the organic electrolyte by far with a retention of 81% after 350 cycles. These results show the suitability of RTILs to enhance the performance of SIB systems and serve as a basis for the design of high performance IL electrolytes.",

Here we propose a cyanoperovskite KxMnFe(CN)6 (0 ≤ x ≤ 2) as a potassium cathode: high-spin MnIII/MnII and low-spin FeIII/FeII couples have similar energies and exhibit two close plateaus centered at 3.6 V; two active K+ per formula unit enable a theoretical specific capacity of 156 mAh g-1; Mn and Fe are the two most-desired transition metals for electrodes because they are cheap and environmental friendly. As a powder prepared by an inexpensive precipitation method, the cathode delivers a specific capacity of 142 mAh g-1. The observed voltage, capacity, and its low cost make it competitive in large-scale electricity storage applications.",

We investigated the changes in the crystal structure, surface chemistry, and particle morphology caused by Ti doping and correlated these changes to the improved performance. The enhanced rate capability and cycling stability were attributed to the enlargement of the NaO2 slab in the crystal structure because of Ti doping.

        "abstract": "The conventional P2-type cathode material Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 suffers from an irreversible P2–O2 phase transition and serious capacity fading during cycling. Here, we successfully carry out magnesium and calcium ion doping into the transition-metal layers (TM layers) and the alkali-metal layers (AM layers), respectively, of Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2. Both Mg and Ca doping can reduce O-type stacking in the high-voltage region, leading to enhanced cycling endurance, however, this is associated with a decrease in capacity. The results of density functional theory (DFT) studies reveal that the introduction of Mg2+ and Ca2+ make high-voltage reactions (oxygen redox and Ni4+/Ni3+ redox reactions) less accessible. Thanks to the synergetic effect of co-doping with Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions, the adverse effects on high-voltage reactions involving Ni–O bonding are limited, and the structural stability is further enhanced. The finally obtained P2-type Na0.62Ca0.025Ni0.28Mg0.05Mn0.67O2 exhibits a satisfactory initial energy density of 468.2 W h kg−1 and good capacity retention of 83% after 100 cycles at 50 mA g−1 within the voltage range of 2.2–4.35 V.

        "abstract": "Abstract Conventional sodium‐based layered oxide cathodes are extremely air sensitive and possess poor electrochemical performance along with safety concerns when operating at high voltage. The polyanion phosphate, Na3V2(PO4)3 stands out as an excellent candidate due to its high nominal voltage, ambient air stability, and long cycle life. The caveat is that Na3V2(PO4)3 can only exhibit reversible capacities in the range of 100 mAh g−1, 20% below its theoretical capacity. Here, the synthesis and characterizations are reported for the first time of the sodium‐rich vanadium oxyfluorophosphate, Na3.2Ni0.2V1.8(PO4)2F2O, a tailored derivative compound of Na3V2(PO4)3, with extensive electrochemical and structural analyses. Na3.2Ni0.2V1.8(PO4)2F2O delivers an initial reversible capacity of 117 mAh g−1 between 2.5 and 4.5 V under the 1C rate at room temperature, with 85% capacity retention after 900 cycles. The cycling stability is further improved when the material is cycled at 50 °C within 2.8–4.3 V for 100 cycles. When paired with a presodiated hard carbon, Na3.2Ni0.2V1.8(PO4)2F2O cycled with a capacity retention of 85% after 500 cycles. Cosubstitution of the transition metal and fluorine in Na3.2Ni0.2V1.8(PO4)2F2O as well as the sodium‐rich structure are the major factors behind the improvement of specific capacity and cycling stability, which paves the way for this cathode in sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The iron‐based pyrophosphate Na2FeP2O7 (NFP) is considered as one of the most promising cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) due to its low‐cost and superior structure stability, yet it usually suffers from poor intrinsic electronic conductivity. Herein, a two‐step carbon‐coating technique has been developed to synthesize high‐performance NFP@C cathode materials by controlling the NFP particle size and the coating layer uniformity. The first step of in‐situ carbon coating greatly restrains the excessive growth of NFP crystals with a shortened Na‐ion diffusion path. Meantime, the extra secondary carbon‐coating is adopted to repair some exposed areas, guaranteeing the full coverage of NFP particles for rapid electronic transfer. As a consequence, the as‐obtained NFP@C cathode delivers a high discharge capacity of 95.2 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C (theoretical value: 97 mAh g−1) and with high‐rate capability (75.2 mAh g−1 at 5 C) within 2.0–4.0 V. A capacity retention of 95.3% can be achieved even after 500 cycles at 5 C in coin‐type cells. Such superior electrochemical performances are expected to quickly promote the applications of NFP in SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Worries about lithium supplies have led to the development of research on sodium batteries. Sodium-ion batteries are regarded as the next generation of energy-storage devices thanks to the generous resources of sodium. In spite of that, structural changes in the electrode materials remain the main challenge of this storage technology. NaCoO2 has been widely investigated as a competitive candidate for LiCoO2. It has been found that the electrochemical cycling curves of this material present numerous potential steps as a result of electronic transitions and/or structural ordering. From this standpoint, this paper reports a novel cathode material, Na2/3Co0.95Ti0.05O2, where 5% of cobalt was replaced by titanium, prepared via a facile solid-state route. The sodiation/desodiation mechanism of this layered material was investigated. Na//Na2/3Co0.95Ti0.05O2 exhibits a first initial capacity of 119 mAh/g in the potential window 2-4.2 V with less potential jumps in the potential versus capacity curve compared to NaCoO2. Genuinely, the electrochemistry of this material demonstrated a reversibility upon the insertion/desinertion process with low polarization. In situ synchrotron investigations on Na2/3Co0.95Ti0.05O2 reveal the occurrence of reversible ordered phases. Ex situ magic-angle-spinning NMR disclosed different environments around sodium starting from the pristine state to the end of charge.",

        "abstract": "Layered transition metal oxides are widely considered as ideal cathode materials for SIBs. However, the existing P2 and O3 structures possess specific issues, which limit their practical applications. To address these issues, this work designed a novel intergrowth layered oxide cathode with P2 and O3 phases by implementing Cu and Ti into the structure with the formation of high-entropy cathode materials with superior performance for SIBs. The electrochemical test results show that the optimized high-entropy cathode with the P2/O3 intergrowth structure possesses a high initial discharge capacity of 157.85 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C, an excellent rate performance of 84.41 mAh g-1 at 10 C, and long-term stability with capacity retention of 83.25% after 500 cycles at 5C. Furthermore, the analysis results of ex situ XRD and in situ XRD indicate that the adverse phase transition of P2-O2 under high voltage is effectively suppressed. This work indicates that the integration of high-entropy strategy with the two-phase intergrowth structure can effectively stabilize the layered structure, suppress the slipping of transition metal layers, and improve electrochemical performance, which provides a new approach for designing high-performance and practical layered transition metal oxide cathode materials for advanced SIBs.",

However, this pre-metallation technique is seriously suffered from the precise regulation of decomposition potential of additive. Herein, a molecularly compensated pre-metallation (Li/Na/K) strategy has been successfully achieved through Kolbe electrolysis, in which the electrochemical oxidation potential of metal carboxylate is manipulated by the bonding energy of oxygen-metal (O-M) moiety. As theoretically predicted, the electron-donating effect of substituent and low charge density of cation can dramatically weaken the O-M bond strength, further bringing out the reduced potential. Thus, sodium acetate exhibits a superior pre-sodiation feature for sodium-ion battery accompanied with a large irreversible specific capacity of 301.8 mAh g -1 , remarkably delivering 70. 6% enhanced capacity retention after 100 cycles. Notably, this elaborate methodology has been profoundly extended to construct high-performance lithium-ion battery and lithium/sodium/potassium-ion capacitor.

X‐ray diffraction (XRD) is utilized to evaluate the crystal structure transition from Co0.2‐MnO2 to NaMnO2 with discharge to 1 V, proving that Co‐doping does indeed facilitate the acceleration of ion transport and support layer spacing to stabilize the structure of MnO2. Subsequently, highly conductive (0.0848 S cm−1) gel‐type supercapacitors are prepared by combining Co0.2‐MnO2, potassium hydroxide (KOH), and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) together. Co0.2‐MnO2 provides capacitive behavior and strengthens the hydrogen bonds between molecules. KOH acts as an ion crosslinker to enhance hydrogen bond and as electrolyte to transport ions. 5 wt% Co0.2‐MnO2@KOH/PVA has superb mechanical endurance, appreciable electrical conductivity, and ideal capacitive behavior. The quasi‐solid‐state supercapacitor demonstrates stabilized longevity (86.5% at 0.2 mA cm−3 after 500 cycles), which can greatly promote the integration of flexible energy storage fabric devices.",

In situ Raman, ex situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and soft‐X‐ray absorption spectroscopy are employed to unequivocally confirm the reversibility of O22− species formation and suggest a high degree of anionic reaction in this NMI Na‐rich material. In operando X‐ray diffraction study discloses the asymmetric structure evolution between the initial and subsequent cycles, which also explains the effect of the charge compensation mechanism on the electrochemical performance.

However, the structural defects of Mn ions inside the crystal framework reduce the sodium storage capacity, voltage plateau, and cyclic stability of the cathodes. Here, a strategy to inhibit the Mn ion defects of Na4MnCr(PO4)3 has been proposed by using different phosphate sources. It is found that Na4MnCr(PO4)3 prepared with NH4H2PO4 (NMCP-N) exhibits less noticeable voltage hysteresis than that of Na4MnCr(PO4)3 prepared with H3PO4 (NMCP-H), indicating that the site occupation defects of Mn ions in the Na4MnCr(PO4)3 crystal structure are successfully suppressed, as confirmed by theoretical calculations and structural refinements. In the case of NMCP-N, a capacity of 109.7 mAh g-1 is delivered at 0.01 A g-1, and 54.2% capacity retention can be kept after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g-1, which is much better than that of the counterpart of NMCP-H (a lower capacity of 96.1 mAh g-1 and poorer cyclability of only 22.8% capacity retention after 500 cycles), showing that the structure defects strongly affect the sodium storage properties of Na4MnCr(PO4)3 cathodes.

Even in full cell configuration, the energy density remains high at ≈380 Wh kg-1 based on the cathode mass. The high capacity of NFPP/NVTP is also attributed to the successive reduction/oxidation mechanism involving the introduction of Ti3+ and interfacial charge redistribution effect between the heterogeneous phases, which greatly improve the electronic and ionic conductivity.

        "abstract": "The carbon coating strategy has emerged as an indispensable approach to improve the conductivity of polyanionic cathodes. However, owing to the complex reaction process between precursors of carbon and cathode, establishing a unified screening principle for carbonaceous precursors remains a technical challenge. Herein, we reveal that carbonaceous precursor pyrolysis chemistry undeniably influences the formation process and performance of Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathodes from in situ insights. By investigating three types of carbonaceous precursors, it is found that O/H-containing functional groups can provide more bonding sites for cathode precursors and generate a reducing atmosphere by pyrolysis, which is beneficial to the formation of polyanionic materials and a uniform carbon coating layer. Conversely, excessive pyrolysis of functional groups leads to a significant amount of gas, which is detrimental to the compactness of the carbon layer. Furthermore, the substantial presence of residual heteroatoms diminishes graphitization. In this case, it is demonstrated that carbon dots (CDs) precursors with suitable functional groups can comprehensively enhance the Na+ migration rate, reversibility, and interface stability of the cathode material.

Li doping in layered transition-metal oxide (TMO) cathode materials is known to enhance their electrochemical properties. Nevertheless, the influence of Li at different locations in the structure has not been investigated. Here, the crystallographic role and electrochemical impact of lithium on different sites in PNNMO is investigated in LixNa0.67–yNi0.33Mn0.67O2+δ (0.00 ≤ x ≤ 0.2, y = 0, 0.1). Lithium occupancy on prismatic Na sites is promoted in Na-deficient (Na < 0.67) PNNMO, evidenced by ex situ and operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and 7Li solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance. Partial substitution of Na with Li leads to enhanced stability and slightly increased specific capacity compared to PNNMO. In contrast, when lithium is located primarily on octahedral TM sites, capacity is increased but at the cost of stability.",

The thermodynamically stable configurations of doped NASICON structures were then selected using machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP), enabling rapid consideration of various dopant site configurations. DFT calculations are followed on 796 screened materials to obtain energy density, average voltage, and volume change. Finally, 50 candidates with an average voltage of ≥3.5 V are identified.

        "abstract": "Rechargeable sodium‐ion batteries are proposed as the most appropriate alternative to lithium batteries due to the fast consumption of the limited lithium resources. Due to their improved safety, polyanion framework compounds have recently gained attention as potential candidates. With the earth‐abundant element Fe being the redox center, the uniform carbon‐coated Na3.32Fe2.34(P2O7)2/C composite represents a promising alternative for sodium‐ion batteries. The electrochemical results show that the as‐prepared Na3.32Fe2.34(P2O7)2/C composite can deliver capacity of ≈100 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C (1 C = 120 mA g−1), with capacity retention of 92.3% at 0.5 C after 300 cycles. After adding fluoroethylene carbonate additive to the electrolyte, 89.6% of the initial capacity is maintained, even after 1100 cycles at 5 C. The electrochemical mechanism is systematically investigated via both in situ synchrotron X‐ray diffraction and density functional theory calculations. The results show that the sodiation and desodiation are single‐phase‐transition processes with two 1D sodium paths, which facilitates fast ionic diffusion. A small volume change, nearly 100% first‐cycle Coulombic efficiency, and a pseudocapacitance contribution are also demonstrated. This research indicates that this new compound could be a potential competitor for other iron‐based cathode electrodes for application in large‐scale Na rechargeable batteries.",

        "abstract": "Red phosphorus (P) has been recognized as a promising material for lithium/sodium ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs) because of their high theoretical capacity. However, tremendous volume variation and low conductivity limit its widespread applications. Hence, we design and synthesize uniformly distributed honeycomb-like hierarchical micro-mesoporous carbon nanospheres (HHPCNSs) with ultralarge pore volume (3.258 cm3 g-1) on a large scale through a facile way. The large pore volume provides enough space for loading of P and the expansion of P, and the uniform distribution of the micro-mesopores makes the red P loaded uniformly. The resulted HHPCNSs/P composite exhibits extremely high capacity (2463.8 and 2367.6 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 for LIBs and SIBs, respectively), splendid rate performance (842.2 and 831.1 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1 for LIBs and SIBs, respectively) and superior cycling stability (1201.6 and 938.4 mA h g-1 at 2 and 5 A g-1 after 1000 cycles for LIBs, and 1269.4 and 861.8 mA h g-1 at 2 and 5 A g-1 after 1000 cycles for SIBs, respectively). More importantly, when coupled with LiFePO4 and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, lithium/sodium-ion full batteries display high capacity, superior rate and cycling performances, revealing the practicability of HHPCNSs/P composite. The exceptional electrochemical performance is caused by the honeycomb-like carbon network with ultralarge pore volume, uniformly distributed hierarchical micro-mesoporous nanostructure, outstanding electronic conductivity and excellent nanostructural stability, which is much better than currently reported P/C materials for both LIBs and SIBs.",

In addition, redox potentials of the materials differ significantly even though they have the same transition metal ratios. These differences are attributed to the changes in local structures of the as-prepared materials arising from the different amount of Na and possibly oxygen in the lattice. Materials with x = 0.67 and 0.75 show excellent rate performance and cycle stability when tested as cathode material of SIBs.

However, Na3V2(PO4)3 suffers from undesirable rate performance and unstable cyclability arising from low electronic conductivity. Herein, we propose a facile approach for significantly enhancing the electrochemical properties of Na3V2(PO4)3 by Ti doping at V site and constructing nanoparticle@carbon core-shell nanostructure. This material design provides fast electron conduction network within the whole active particles because of the mixed valence Ti4+/3+ in bulk and highly conductive carbon shell on the surface. Lattice doping and carbon coating reduce the electrode polarization and facilitate the electrode reaction kinetics, while the nanostructure enhances the ionic conduction by shortening the diffusion distance and offers sufficient contact of active particles with organic electrolyte. The multiple synergetic effects enable a superior electrochemical performance. The optimized Na3V1.9Ti0.1(PO4)3@C cathode shows a high specific capacity (116.6 mAh g-1 at 1C), an unprecedented rate performance (93.4 mAh g-1 at 400C), and an exceptional long-term high-rate cycling stability (capacity retention of 69.5% after 14 000 cycles at 100C, corresponding to 0.0002% decay per cycle).",

Herein, P2-Na0.67[Mn0.67Ni0.21Li0.06Zn0.06]O2 cathode is gained by moderately substituting lithium/zinc into the nickel sites. The inactive Li/Zn co-substitution is endowed with safeguard ability to stabilize the crystal structure, resulting in enhanced electrochemical kinetics and remarkable long cyclic performance in liquid & solid-state electrolyte. Thus the Li/Zn co-substituted cathode presents specific capacity of 154 mAh g1 at the first discharge process, excellent rate capability with 77 mAh g1 at a high current density of 5 C, and long cyclic stability in liquid-state batteries. Excitingly, it is also endowed with a high capacity retention of 85% after 500 cycles in solid-state batteries. Furthermore, a combination of ex-situ XRD, TEM and ex-situ XPS are applied to reveal the structural evolution and charge compensation mechanism of P2-Na0.67[Mn0.67Ni0.21Li0.06Zn0.06]O2, allowing a deep insight into the great significance of structural safeguard ability.",

        "abstract": "Sodium polyanionic compounds with transition metals are of considerable research interest for the search of new cathode materials for sodium‐ion batteries. In this work, we employed ab initio calculations to evaluate three key battery properties: phase stability, diffusion barriers and redox voltage of low‐symmetry molybdates NaMFe(MoO4)3 (M = Mg, Ni) with α‐ and β‐NaFe2(MoO4)3 structures. First, we showed that the Hubbard Ucorrection within the GGA + Uapproach is necessary to correctly refer these molybdates to semiconductors. The sodium diffusion along various pathways was thoroughly examined, which allowed us to establish the most probable pathways with the lowest migration barriers. These compounds have different directions of sodium diffusion with twice different barriers that was associated to the peculiarities of their crystal structure. The high potentials and structural stability during sodium extraction, along with low‐diffusion barriers predicted for NaMFe(MoO4)3 (M = Mg, Ni) indicate that these molybdates may be promising high‐voltage cathode materials for sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Exploring future cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries, alluaudite class of Na2Fe(II)2(SO4)3 has been recently unveiled as a 3.8 V positive insertion candidate (Barpanda et al. Nat. Commun. 2014, 5, 4358). It forms an Fe-based polyanionic compound delivering the highest Fe-redox potential along with excellent rate kinetics and reversibility. However, like all known SO4-based insertion materials, its synthesis is cumbersome that warrants careful processing avoiding any aqueous exposure. Here, an alternate low temperature ionothermal synthesis has been described to produce the alluaudite Na2+2xFe(II)2-x(SO4)3. It marks the first demonstration of solvothermal synthesis of alluaudite Na2+2xM(II)2-x(SO4)3 (M = 3d metals) family of cathodes. Unlike classical solid-state route, this solvothermal route favors sustainable synthesis of homogeneous nanostructured alluaudite products at only 300 °C, the lowest temperature value until date. The current work reports the synthetic aspects of pristine and modified ionothermal synthesis of Na2+2xFe(II)2-x(SO4)3 having tunable size (300 nm ∼5 μm) and morphology. It shows antiferromagnetic ordering below 12 K. A reversible capacity in excess of 80 mAh/g was obtained with good rate kinetics and cycling stability over 50 cycles. Using a synergistic approach combining experimental and ab initio DFT analysis, the structural, magnetic, electronic, and electrochemical properties and the structural limitation to extract full capacity have been described.",

However, the rhombohedral phase of this compound still remains elusive. This study addresses the electronic and structural properties of the rhombohedral host material, as well as its ionic conductivity. Using periodic density functional theory calculations, we identified the critical factors that determine the sodium ion site preference and their ionic mobility. Specifically, the significant role of octahedral tilting and trigonal distortions of the structure have been highlighted. The study shows that the competition between coordination and bond length governs the Na site preference in the rhombohedral phase upon distortion. The results furthermore suggest that the redox activity is dominated by the transition metals. These findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying ionic conductivity in solid hosts and could thus help enhance ion transport in battery electrodes.",

The optimized N-doped carbon coated Na3V2(PO4)3 (denoted as NVP@C-N150) displays a very thin and uniform N-doped carbon coating layer (thickness: ∼2 nm), showing an excellent sodium storage performance (85 mA h g-1 at 20 C after 5000 cycles) and high rate capability (71 mA h g-1 at 80 C). Such a superior sodium storage performance derives from the nitrogen doping carbon coating, triggering amounts of extrinsical defects and active sites in the N-doped amorphous carbon layer, which highly accelerates Na-ion and electron transport. This approach is simple, facile and shows easy scale-up. It could be extended to other materials for energy storage.",

However, the crystalline structure and the electrochemical performance of PW strongly depend on the hydration level, which is difficult to control, leading to discrepancies in the results and interpretations presented in the literature. This work aims to provide a deeper insight into the dehydration process of PW materials and a better understanding of the impact of their fast rehydration, upon exposure to moisture, on their characterization. For this purpose, a Na1.87Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.99·1.99H2O sample was synthesized by a coprecipitation method and subsequently dehydrated to remove water. After thorough characterization, our findings show that drying parameters, such as temperature and pressure, strongly influence the post-drying result. Moreover, the dehydrated samples rehydrate within minutes of exposure to air, which may explain some discrepancies observed in the literature and highlights the necessity to work under fully air-tight conditions.",

        "abstract": "High-Ni layered oxides are potential cathodes for high energy Li-ion batteries due to their large specific capacity advantage. However, the fast capacity fade by undesirable structural degradation in liquid electrolyte during long-term cycling is a stumbling block for the commercial application of high-Ni oxides. In this work, a functional gel polymer electrolyte, grafted with sodium alginate, is introduced to increase the stability of high-Ni oxide cathodes at the levels of both the particle and electrode. An in situ generated ion-conducting layer appears on the interface through the chemical interaction between transition-metal cations of the cathode and the metalophilic reticulum group in sodium alginate. Such a tailoring layer can not only enhance the interfacial compatibility on the cathode/electrolyte interface, reducing the interfacial resistance, but also inhibit the HF corrosion, suppressing the dissolution of transition-metal cations and harmful gradient distribution of components through the oxide cathode at the electrode level. Meanwhile, detrimental microcracks in oxide microspheres and between primary crystallites are impressively inhibited at the particle level. The high-Ni oxide cathode with the metalophilic gel polymer electrolyte shows excellent cycle stability with large initial capacity of 204.9 mA h g-1 at a 1.0 C rate and high discharge capacity retention within 300 cycles at high temperature.",

Herein, a topotactic syntopogenous Na3VF6/NaVF3 superlattice formulated as Na2.9V1.1F6 (NVF) was synthesized by a facile one-step low-temperature hydrothermal reaction. NVF nanoparticles show an excellent Na+ storage capacity (∼205 mAh g-1) in a high voltage window up to 4.2 V with ultralong cycling stability. That is associated with the mixed occupancy of V and Na in NVF. The multivalent V centers serve as electron reservoirs to inhibit phase transformation, and the Na-enriched Na3VF6 with better electron conductivity acts as a Na+ reservoir for effective electron transfer. Highly reversible (de)intercalation of Na+ is achieved in the channel of perovskite-type NaVF3 with structural integrity.",

However, its practical application is limited by poor rate performance, which can be tuned and improved by controlling point defects. We herein present a comprehensive study of intrinsic point defects in NMO using density functional theory (DFT) calculations in combination with thermodynamics. Using the DFT+U approach, we determine the formation energies of elementary defects and defect complexes depending on the sets of atomic chemical potentials, corresponding to a certain thermodynamic condition for the synthesis of stable NMO. Sodium interstitials are found to have the lowest formation energies in the relevant ranges of temperature and pressure. Other intrinsic point defects such as oxygen vacancies, sodium vacancies and manganese antisites can also be formed with proper formation energies and have an impact on the cathode performance. Compared to the perfect system, oxygen vacancies lower the electrode voltage, whereas manganese vacancies and antisites increase the voltage. We find that most point defects and defect complexes improve the sodium ion diffusivity, highlighting a proper control of defect formation for enhancing the performance of sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The main challenge of sodium-ion batteries is cycling stability, which is usually compromised due to strain induced by sodium insertion. Reliable high-voltage cathode materials are needed to compensate the generally lower operating voltages of Na-ion batteries compared to Li-ion ones. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) computations were used to evaluate the thermodynamic, structural, and kinetic properties of the high voltage λ-Mn2O4 and λ-Mn1.5Ni0.5O4 spinel structures as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Determination of the enthalpies of formation reveal the reaction mechanisms (phase separation vs solid solution) during sodiation, while structural analysis underlines the importance of minimizing strain to retain the metastable sodiated phases. For the λ-Mn1.5Ni0.5O4 spinel, a thorough examination of the Mn/Ni cation distribution (dis/ordered variants) was performed. The exact sodiation mechanism was found to be dependent on the transition metal ordering in a similar fashion to the insertion behavior observed in the Li-ion system. The preferred reaction mechanism for the perfectly ordered spinel is phase separation throughout the sodiation range, while in the disordered spinel, the phase separation terminates in the 0.625 < x < 0.875 concentration range and is followed by a solid solution insertion reaction. Na-ion diffusion in the spinel lattice was studied using DFT as well. Energy barriers of 0.3–0.4 eV were predicted for the pure spinel, comparing extremely well with the ones for the Li-ion and being significantly better than the barriers reported for multivalent ions. Additionally, Na-ion macroscopic diffusion through the 8a-16c-8a 3D network was demonstrated via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. For the λ-Mn1.5Ni0.5O4, MD simulations at 600 K bring forward a normal to inverse spinel half-transformation, common for spinels at high temperatures, showing the contrast in Na-ion diffusion between the normal and inverse lattice. The observed Ni migration to the tetrahedral sites at room temperature MD simulations explains the kinetic limitations experienced experimentally. Therefore, this work provides a detailed understanding of the (de)sodiation mechanisms of high voltage λ-Mn2O4 and λ-Mn1.5Ni0.5O4 spinel structures, which are of potential interest as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

This work presents a double network gel electrolyte based on poly(N-hydroxymethyl acrylamide) (PNMA) and sodium alginate (SA), overcoming this trade-off. The PNMA network provides mechanical strength and water retention, while the SA network facilitates rapid zinc-ion (Zn2+) diffusion through tailored solvation.

The SA network provides ion channels for rapid transport of hydrated Zn2+, enhancing the ionic conductivity to a ground-breaking 33.1 mS cm-1. This value is even higher than the liquid electrolytes. The growth of Zn dendrites is also suppressed due to the mechanical constraint and rapid ion conduction. In symmetrical cells, the PNMA/SA gel demonstrates exceptional cycling stability (>2000 h). Characterizations show this is because of reduced free water amount, hindering cathode material dissolution. The full cells with sodium vanadate cathode manifest a high capacity (364.8 mA h g-1 at 0.5 A g-1) and excellent capacity retention (83% after 2500 cycles at 10 A g-1).

Although considerable experimental efforts are focused on dehydrating water for capacity enhancement, there is still a deficiency of a comprehensive understanding of the low capacity of low-spin Fe resulting from interstitial water, which holds significance in Na+ storage. This study introduces a novel gas-assisted heat treatment method to efficiently remove interstitial water from Fe-based PBA (NaFeHCF) electrodes and combines experiments and theoretical calculations to reveal the iron spin state regulation that is related to the capacity enhancement mechanism. This dehydration strategy significantly enhances battery capacity, especially the portion at higher voltages (3.4-4.0 V). The increase in capacity is attributed to the following factors: an enhanced proportion of Fe2+, reduced water content which facilitates faster charge transfer, and the activation of low spin Fe2+. The optimized NaFeHCF demonstrated impressive half-cell performance of retaining 87.3% capacity after 2000 cycles at a 5 C rate and achieving 100 mAh g-1 capacity over 200 cycles when being paired with hard carbon, exhibiting its practical potential.",

An O3-type Na0.75 Ni0.82 Co0.12 Mn0.06 O2 is achieved through a facile electrochemical ion-exchange strategy in which Li+ ions are first extracted from the LiNi0.82 Co0.12 Mn0.06 O2 cathode and Na+ ions are then inserted into a layered oxide framework. Furthermore, the reaction mechanism of layered Ni-rich oxide during Na+ extraction/insertion is investigated in detail by combining ex situ X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron energy loss spectroscopy. As an excellent cathode for Na-ion batteries, O3-type Na0.75 Ni0.82 Co0.12 Mn0.06 O2 delivers a high reversible capacity of 171 mAh g-1 and a remarkably stable discharge voltage of 2.8 V during long-term cycling. In addition, the fast Na+ transport in the cathode enables high rate capability with 89 mAh g-1 at 9 C. The as-prepared Ni-rich oxide cathode is expected to significantly break through the limited performance of current sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion battery (SIB) is a candidate for the stationary energy storage systems because of the low cost and high abundance of sodium. However, the energy density and lifespan of SIBs suffer severely from the irreversible consumption of the Na-ions for the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and other side reactions on the electrodes. Here, Na3.5C6O6 is proposed as an air-stable high-efficiency sacrificial additive in the cathode to compensate for the lost sodium. It is characteristic of low desodiation (oxidation) potential (3.4-3.6 V vs. Na+/Na) and high irreversible desodiation capacity (theoretically 378 mAh g-1). The feasibility of using Na3.5C6O6 as a sodium compensation additive is verified with the improved electrochemical performances of a Na2/3Ni1/3Mn1/3Ti1/3O2ǀǀhard carbon cells and cells using other cathode materials. In addition, the structure of Na3.5C6O6 and its desodiation path are also clarified on the basis of comprehensive physical characterizations and the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This additive decomposes completely to supply abundant Na ions during the initial charge without leaving any electrochemically inert species in the cathode. Its decomposition product C6O6 enters the carbonate electrolyte without bringing any detectable negative effects. These findings open a new avenue for elevating the energy density and/or prolonging the lifetime of the high-energy-density secondary batteries.",

        "abstract": "Layered manganese-based cathode materials are of great interest due to their high specific capacities for sodium ion batteries. However, the Jahn-Teller effect and the inevitable phase transition are detrimental for achieving considerable cycling stability and rate capability. Herein, a P2-type manganese oxide nanoplate cathode material modified by Mo-substitution with oriented stacking structure and exposed {010} active facets is reported. The manganese oxide nanoplate cathode yields remarkable capacity retention of 87.8% after 1200 cycles at 10C (2000 mA g-1). The specific power density is estimated as high as 530 W Kg-1 with a specific discharge capacity 143.9 mA h g-1 at 1C and 89.6% capacity retention up to 100 cycles. The superior electrochemical performances can be attributed to the efficient chemical modification and the unique structural features of the present manganese oxide nanoplate. Mo-modification can endow manganese oxide cathode with enlarged lattice space and average oxidation state and thus favorable Na+ diffusion to inhibit the Jahn-Teller effect and improve the structure stability, thereby achieving an extremely long cycling life. Multilayer oriented stacking nanoplate structure with exposed {010} active facets is also beneficial for providing more surface active sites and shortening the Na+ diffusion path, leading to better rate capability.",

Herein, a biphasic tunnel/layered 0.80Na0.44 MnO2 /0.20Na0.70 MnO2 (80T/20L) cathode delivering exceptional rate performance through subtly regulating the sodium and manganese stoichiometry is reported. It delivers a reversible capacity of 87 mAh g-1 at 4 A g-1 (33 C), much higher than that of tunnel Na0.44 MnO2 (72 mAh g-1 ) and layered Na0.70 MnO2 (36 mAh g-1 ). It proves that the one-pot synthesized 80T/20L is able to suppress the deactivation of L-Na0.70 MnO2 under air-exposure, which improves the specific capacity and cycling stability. Based on electrochemical kinetics analysis, the electrochemical storage of 80T/20L is mainly based on pseudocapacitive surface-controlled process. The thick film of 80T/20L cathode (a single-side mass loading over 10 mg cm-2 ) also has superior properties of pseudocapacitive response (over 83.5% at a low sweep rate of 1 mV s-1 ) and excellent rate performance.

Electrochemical measurements show an initial discharge-specific capacity of 135 mA h g-1 at 1 C, and the discharge capacity maintains 82 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles at 10 C. The results indicate the improvement in electrical conductivity and electrochemical performance due to the Co doping from ZIF-67. Moreover, we calculate the diffusion coefficient of sodium ions by the cyclic voltammetry (CV, DNa+ = 1.521 × 10-11 and 2.3484 × 10-11 cm2 s-1 for charging and discharging, respectively) and the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT, DNa+ ranges from 10-11-10-15 cm2 s-1).

        "abstract": "Recently, aqueous zinc-ion batteries have become a hot research topic in the field of grid-scale application, which can be attributed to their low-cost, aqueous electrolyte and dominant theoretical reversible capacity. Nevertheless, the lack of suitable cathode materials greatly hinders the development of aqueous zinc-ion batteries. In this work, we adopt a simple one-step synthesis strategy to prepare (NH4)2V6O16 with an intercalation of Na+ and H2O, which exhibits a novel crystal structure in which the ammonium ion, crystal water, and sodium ion co-locate in the V3O8 layers. The co-intercalation not only effectively enhances the binding energy between V-O layers to suppress vanadium dissolution but also successfully improves the structural stability to alleviate the structural collapse during the cyclic process. As result, (NH4)2V6O16 with the intercalation of crystal water and Na+ presents a remarkable reversible discharge capacity of 423.9 mA h g-1 after 90 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 with an excellent energy density of 350.3 W h kg-1 and demonstrates an outstanding specific capacity of 182.5 mA h g-1 at the high current density of 5 A g-1 upon 1400 cycles during the ultra-wide voltage window of 0.1-2.0 V.",

Electronic structure regulation stands out as a highly effective approach to address the inherent limitations of P2‐type layered oxides with LOR, including sluggish kinetics, phase transitions, voltage hysteresis, and local structural distortion. Herein, a strategy involving the introduction of CoO6 octahedra with π‐interaction into Na0.6Li0.1Fe0.3−xCoxMn0.6O2 (x = 0, 0.15, 0.3) cathodes to facilitate Na‐ion transport is proposed. Furthermore, the impact of FeO6 octahedra with σ‐interaction in P2‐type cathodes on electrochemical performance is comprehensively investigated. Through multimodal in‐situ and ex‐situ characterization techniques, it is revealed that Co─O with π‐interaction effectively mitigates P2‐OP4 phase transitions by strengthening Na─O, reduces voltage hysteresis, and stabilizes the local structure. Consequently, Na0.6Li0.1Co0.3Mn0.6O2 demonstrates enhanced Na‐ion diffusion kinetics, leading to improved rate performance and a reversible capacity of 55 mAh g−1 at 10 C, significantly outperforming cathodes with Fe─O σ‐interaction.

This microsphere-structured NVPOF@P/N/C composite has a relatively high tap density of 1.22 g cm-3.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that N/P-dual-doped carbon layer is advantageous to achieve higher electronic conductivity and lower migration activation energy than the undoped and single N- or P-doped carbon layer. As cathode material for sodium-ion battery (SIB), the NVPOF@P/N/C exhibits high capacity (128 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C and 122 mAh g-1 at 2 C) and ultra-long cycle performance (only 0.037% capacity fading rate per cycle in 500 cycles at 2 C).

The orthorhombic β-Na2FePO4F material has been studied extensively and intensively since it was proposed. In this article, a novel monoclinic sodium phosphate fluoride α-Na2FePO4F is concerned. Kirsanova's experiment showed that Na and Fe ions in α-Na2FePO4F are prone to antisite, leading to strong antisite disorder. Through first-principle calculations, we show that the steric effect, the magnetic exchange and superexchange interactions between transition-metal cations are shown to be the main driving forces for Na+/Fe2+ antisite disorder. We first calculated the crystal structures, electronic properties, and cohesive energies of all the 10 antisite phases of α-Na2FePO4F and β-Na2FePO4F. Then, we compared the difference charge densities, magnetism, binding energies, and electrostatic potentials of α-Na2FePO4F and β-Na2FePO4F materials in the antisite and pristine phases. In α-Na2FePO4F, the binding energy of the antisite phase with the lowest binding energy is almost degenerate with that of the pristine phase. Moreover, only small differences of the electrostatic potential and the charge density distribution are found between the antisite (with lowest energy) and the pristine phases of α-Na2FePO4F, which also helped elaborate the facile formation of Na+/Fe2+ antisite in the α-Na2FePO4F material.

However, olivine NaFePO4 only can be synthesized from olivine LiFePO4. Accordingly, in this proposal, developing the continuous flow electrochemical solid-liquid reactor-based metal ion insertion technology is to utilize the olivine FePO4, recycled from LiFePO4, and to synthesize NaFePO4. Additionally, by employing I- as the reducing agent, NaFePO4 is successfully synthesized with a discharge-specific capacity of 134 mAh g-1 at 0.1C and a remarkable capacity retention rate of 86.5% after 100 cycles at 0.2C. And the reasons for sodium deficiency in the synthesized NFP are elucidated through first-principles calculations. Furthermore, the kinetics of the solid-solution reaction 2 (Na2/3+βPO4→ Na1-αFePO4) mechanism improve with cycling and are sensitive to temperature. Utilizing a minimal amount of reducing agent in the electrochemical reactor, NaFePO4 synthesis is successfully achieved. This innovative approach offers a new, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly strategy for preparing NaFePO4 from recycling LiFePO4.",

        "abstract": "The P2-layered metal oxide cathode materials are crucial for constructing high-rate sodium-ion batteries (SIBs); however, its practical application is hindered by the high Na+ diffusion barrier resulting from Na+/vacancy ordering. Herein, a Li/Zn cosubstitution P2-Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 (NLNZM) cathode was synthesized via a sol-gel method assisted with citric acid, which can induce the rearrangement of Na+ sites to disrupt ordered structures. The XRD Rietveld refinement confirms a higher occupancy of Na+ at Nae sites with low diffusion barriers through the Li/Zn cosubstitution. In addition, the highly reversible phase evolution of the NLNZM is confirmed through in situ XRD results, thereby ensuring the stability of the structure with low volume change rate (0.78%). Furthermore, Li and Zn can reduce the surface energy and increase the interlayered distance to achieve rapid interfacial kinetics. As a result, the NLNZM has exhibited a high reversible capacity of 152.8 mAh g-1 and an outstanding rate performance of 103.4 mAh g-1 at 5C. After 200 cycles at 5C, the capacity retention rate is 81.1%. This work proposes a cosubstitution strategy to induce Na+/vacancy disorder for achieving rapid Na+ migration as a cathode material for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "O3-type NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 (NNM) is very competitive for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high capacity and easy production. Nevertheless, the intricate phase transitions during the charging-discharging significantly impede its practical application. This paper proposes a strategy for successfully synthesizing NaNi0.5Mn0.3Ti0.2O2 (NNMT) by combining coprecipitation and a high-temperature solid-state method. This method introduces Ti elements while retaining the electrochemically active Ni2+ content, thus, the NNMT has a high initial specific capacity of 151.4 mAh g-1 at 1 C. It is demonstrated that introducing Ti4+ leads to the transition metal layers becoming disordered by ex situ XRD, thus mitigating the irreversible phase transition of the material. In addition, Ti4+ does not have an outer electron, which can reduce electron delocalization in the transition metal layer and improve the material's cyclic stability. The NNMT possesses a capacity retention rate of 60.66% after 150 cycles, much higher than the initial NNM's 18.96%. It also exhibits an excellent discharge capacity of 86.8 mAh g-1 at 5 C. In conclusion, the cycling and rate performance of the Ti-substituted NNMT are greatly improved without capacity loss, which offers innovative concepts for the modification means of the SIBs layered oxide cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "Although sodium ion batteries (NIBs) have gained wide interest, their poor energy density poses a serious challenge for their practical applications. Therefore, high-energy-density cathode materials are required for NIBs to enable the utilization of a large amount of reversible Na ions. This study presents a P2-type Na0.67Co1-xTixO2 (x < 0.2) cathode with an extended potential range higher than 4.4 V to present a high specific capacity of 166 mAh g-1. A group of P2-type cathodes containing various amounts of Ti is prepared using a facile synthetic method. These cathodes show different behaviors of the Na+/vacancy ordering. Na0.67CoO2 suffers severe capacity loss at high voltages due to irreversible structure changes causing serious polarization, while the Ti-substituted cathodes have long credible cycleability as well as high energy. In particular, Na0.67Co0.90Ti0.10O2 exhibits excellent capacity retention (115 mAh g-1) even after 100 cycles, whereas Na0.67CoO2 exhibits negligible capacity retention (<10 mAh g-1) at 4.5 V cutoff conditions. Na0.67Co0.90Ti0.10O2 also exhibits outstanding rate capabilities of 108 mAh g-1 at a current density of 1000 mA g-1 (7.4 C). Increased sodium diffusion kinetics from mitigated Na+/vacancy ordering, which allows high Na+ utilization, are investigated to find in detail the mechanism of the improvement by combining systematic analyses comprising TEM, in situ XRD, and electrochemical methods.",

The capacity of the cathode combined with that provided by the electrolyte redox reaction thus increases overall charge storage. An aqueous sodium hexacyanoferrate (Na4 Fe(CN)6 ) solution is employed as the redox-active electrolyte (Na-FC) and sodium nickel Prussian blue (Nax -NiBP) as the Na+ ion insertion/de-insertion cathode. The capacity of DESIB with Na-FC electrolyte is twice that of a battery using a conventional (Na2 SO4 ) electrolyte.

However, many of these layered materials experience severe capacity decay when operated at high voltage (>4.25 V), hindering their practical application. It is essential to design high-voltage layered cathodes with improved stability for high-energy-density operation. Herein, nano P2-Na2/3(Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13)O2 (NCM) materials are synthesized using a modified Pechini method as a prospective high-voltage sodium storage component without any modification. The changes in the local ionic state around Ni, Mn, and Co ions with respect to the calcination temperature are recorded using X-ray absorption fine structure analysis. Among the electrodes, NCM fired at 850 °C (NCM-850) exhibits excellent electrochemical properties with an initial capacity and energy density of 148 mAh g–1 and 555 Wh kg–1, respectively, when cycled between 2 and 4.5 V at 160 mA g–1 along with improved cyclic stability after 100 charge/discharge cycles. In addition, the NCM-850 electrode is capable of maintaining a 75 mAh g–1 capacity even at a current density of 3200 mA g–1. In contrast, the cell fabricated with NCM obtained at 800 °C shows continuous capacity fading because of the formation of an impurity phase during the synthesis process. The obtained capacity, rate performance, and energy density along with prolonged cyclic life for the cell fabricated with the NCM-850 electrodes are some of the best reported values for sodium-ion batteries as compared to those of other p2-type sodium intercalating materials.",

The biphasic intergrowth structure of layered cathode materials is essential for improving the sodium storage performance, which is attributed to the synergistic effect between the two phases. However, the in-depth formation mechanism of biphasic intergrowth materials remains unclear. Herein, the layered/tunnel intergrowth Na0.6MnO2 (LT-NaMO) as a model material was successfully prepared, and their formation processes and electrochemical performance were systematically investigated. In situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction displays the detailed evolution process and excellent thermal stability of the layered/tunnel intergrowth structure. Furthermore, severe structural strain and large lattice volume changes are significantly mitigated by the interlocking effect between the phase interfaces, which further enhances the structural stability of the cathode materials during the charging/discharging process. Consequently, the LT-NaMO cathode displays fast Na+ transport kinetics with a remarkable capacity retention of ∼70.5% over 300 cycles at 5C, and its assembled full cell with hard carbon also exhibits high energy density. These findings highlight the superior electrochemical performance of intergrowth materials due to interlocking effects between layered and tunnel structures and also provide unique insights into the construction of intergrowth cathode materials for SIBs.",

Under the intercalation of Fe3+ and carbon-coating, as-prepared samples turned to 3D interconnected structures, which were composed of NH4Fe0.6V2.4O7.4 nanoparticles and carbon chains. The 3D interconnected NH4Fe0.6V2.4O7.4@0.5 wt%C nanocomposite exhibits a high discharge specific capacity of 306 mA h g-1 at a current density of 20 mA g-1 and a high-rate capacity of 130 mA h g-1 at 0.4 A g-1. The results of EIS and ex situ SEM indicated that the 3D interconnected NH4Fe0.6V2.4O7.4@0.5 wt%C nanocomposite possesses good electrical conductivity and structural stability. The ex situ XRD results suggest that NH4Fe0.6V2.4O7.4@0.5 wt%C undergoes a reversible insertion/de-insertion mechanism during a charge/discharge process. Our work demonstrates that the 3D interconnected NH4Fe0.6V2.4O7.4@C nanocomposite material could be considered as a potential cathode for sodium ion batteries.",

        "title": "Realizing long-term cycling stability of O3-type layered oxide cathodes for sodium-ion batteries.",
        "abstract": "O3-type layered oxide cathodes are promising for practical sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high theoretical capacity, facile synthesis, and sufficient Na+ storage. However, they face challenges such as rapid capacity loss and poor cycling stability, mainly attributed to irreversible phase transitions. To address these challenges, a novel cathode material, Li/Sn co-substituted O3-Na0.95Li0.07Sn0.01Ni0.22Fe0.2Mn0.5O2 (LSNFM), has been designed by regulating the electronic structure, in which Li+ activates more redox reactions of Ni2+/3+ and Fe3+/4+ above 2.5 V and suppresses the redox reactivity of Mn3+/4+ below 2.5 V, while Sn4+ can prevent the charge delocalization in the transition metal layer, contributing to structural stability. Due to this synergistic effect, the as-prepared LSNFM electrode with high structural reversibility displays a 27.2% capacity increase contributed by the high-voltage transition metal ion redox activity and exhibits excellent long-term cycling stability, an 84.0% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 1 C and an 84.7% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 5 C. The fundamental mechanism is fully investigated using systematic in situ/ex situ characterization techniques and density functional theory computations. This work provides a paradigm for designing long-term cycle life cathode materials by synergistically regulating the electronic structure in practical SIBs.",

In this work, a comparative study on the electronic structures and redox reactions in oxides (LiCrO2, NaCrO2) and sulfides (LiCrS2, NaCrS2) is performed. A first-principles method has been used to calculate the Bader charge transfer, the electronic structures and the magnetic moments during the entire delithiation or desodiation process. The Bader charge analysis suggests that all the S, O and Cr ions in LiCrX2 and NaCrX2 participate in the redox reactions, where the loss of electrons of S ions is clearly larger than that of O ions. Besides, the redox processes of Cr ions are of much less significance. It is noted that, in the sulfides, Cr ions even gain a small portion of electrons rather than losing electrons during the extraction of Li/Na ions. All the charge transfer happens between the S-3p/O-2p and the Cr-3d bands. The redox reactions of O or S ions originate from the energy levels of O/S being pushed towards/across the Fermi surface due to the strong p–d hybridization.",

        "abstract": "Recently, all‐solid‐state sodium batteries (Na‐ASSBs) have received increased interest owing to their high safety and potential of high energy density. The potential of Na‐ASSBs based on sodium superionic conductor (NASICON)‐structured Na3V2(PO4)3(Na3VP) cathodes have been proven by their high capacity and a long cycling stability closely related to the microstructural evolution. However, the detailed kinetics of the electrochemical processes in the cathodes is still unclear. In this work, the sodiation/desodiation process of Na3VP is first investigated using in situ high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The intermediate Na2V2(PO4)3 (Na2VP) phase with the P21/c space group, which would be inhibited by constant electron beam irradiation, is observed at the atomic scale. With the calculated volume change and the electrode–electrolyte interface after cycling, it can be concluded that the Na2VP phase reduces the lattice mismatch between Na3VP and NaV2(PO4)3 (NaVP), preventing structural collapse. Based on the density functional theory calculation (DFT), the Na+ ion migrates more rapidly in the Na2VP structure, which facilitates the desodiation and sodiation processes. The formation of Na2VP phase lowers the formation energy of NaVP. This study demonstrates the dynamic evolution of the Na3VP structure, paving the way for an in‐depth understanding of electrode materials for energy‐storage applications.",

In this study, we apply cold sintering to a model composite cathode system to study how low-temperature densification enables a degree of control over the mixed conducting properties of such systems. The model system contains the NASICON-structured Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) active material, NASICON-structured solid electrolyte (Na3Zr2Si2PO12, NZSP), and electron-conducting carbon nanofiber (CNF). Pellets of varying weight fractions of components were cold-sintered to greater than 90% of the theoretical density at 350-375 °C, a 360 MPa uniaxial pressure, and with a 3 h dwell time using sodium hydroxide as the transient sintering aid. The bulk conductivity of the diphasic composites was measured with impedance spectroscopy; the total conductivities of the composites are increased from 3.8 × 10-8 S·cm-1 (pure NVP) to 5.81 × 10-6 S·cm-1 (60 wt % NZSP) and 1.31 × 10-5 S·cm-1 (5 wt % CNF). Complimentary direct current polarization experiments demonstrate a rational modulation in transference number (τ) of the composites; τ of pure NVP = 0.966, 60 wt % NZSP = 0.995, and 5 wt % CNF = 0.116. Finally, all three materials are combined into triphasic composites to serve as solid-state cathodes in a half-cell configuration with a liquid electrolyte.

However, to compete with mature energy storage technologies such as lithium ion batteries, further progress is needed, particularly regarding the energy density and operational lifetime. Considering these aspects as well as a circular economy perspective, the authors use biodegradable cellulose nanoparticles for the preparation of a gel polymer electrolyte that offers a high liquid electrolyte uptake of 2985%, an ionic conductivity of 2.32 mS cm-1 , and a Na+ transference number of 0.637. A balanced ratio of mechanically rigid cellulose nanocrystals and flexible cellulose nanofibers results in a mesoporous hierarchical structure that ensures close contact with metallic Na. This architecture offers stable Na plating/stripping at current densities up to ±500 µA cm-2 , outperforming conventional fossil-based NIBs containing separator-liquid electrolytes. Paired with an environmentally sustainable and economically attractive Na2 Fe2 (SO4 )3 cathode, the battery reaches an energy density of 240 Wh kg-1 , delivering 69.7 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles at a rate of 1C. In comparison, Celgard in liquid electrolyte delivers only 0.6 mAh g-1 at C/4.

        "abstract": "The abundance of raw materials is a significant advantage that positions sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) as a promising energy storage solution for the future. However, the low cycle efficiency and poor rate capacity of cathode materials have hindered the commercialization of SIBs, prompting extensive research efforts to address these challenges. Ion doping into the material structure is considered to be an effective, simple, and scalable approach to enhancing the electrical performance of cathode materials. In this work, B and F elemental ions were selectively doped into the structure of sodium-lithium-manganese-cobalt oxide material via the sol–gel method combined with calcination. The effects of B and F ion doping on the properties of the obtained materials exhibited distinct variations, particularly in the electrochemical performance. While the B-doped material (B-NLMC) exhibited a specific capacity of up to 166.5 mAh g–1 at a current density of 10 mA g–1 and maintained 72.1% capacity after 100 cycles, the material simultaneously doped with B and F ions (BF-NLMC) demonstrated lower specific capacity and cycling efficiency compared to B-NLMC. However, the BF-NLMC material exhibited significantly improved rate capability, delivering a specific capacity of up to approximately 80 mAh g–1 at a high current density of 200 mA g–1. Obviously, this research offers valuable insights into diversifying doping strategies to enhance the electrochemical performance of cathode materials, contributing to the advancement of SIB technology.",

However, the O 2p non‐bonding state can only undergo redox at high voltages and is often accompanied by severe structural distortion.

Through a systematic analysis of the orbital combinations of TMs and O, it is found that the Mg‐induced O 2p non‐bonding state as an electron donor, forming strong π‐type interactions between Ni 3d spin‐down t2g orbitals. The resulting π‐configurational oxygen occupies an anti‐bonding state just below the Fermi level, exhibiting high oxidation activity and stability. Additionally, the high covalency between Mn and O increases the strength of the Mn–O bond, mitigating the structural aberration of NNMMO. As a result, NNMMO demonstrates a high capacity of 216 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and stable battery performance, with a capacity retention of ≈90% after 500 cycles at 2 C.

        "abstract": "The peak-loading shift function of sodium-ion batteries in large-grid energy store station poses a giant challenge on the account of poor rate performance of cathodes. NASICON type Na3V2(PO4)3 with a stable three-dimensional framework and fast ion diffusion channels has been regarded as one of the potential candidates and extensively studied. Nevertheless, a multilevel integrated tactic to boost the performance of Na3V2(PO4)3 in terms of crystal structure modulation, coated carbon graphitization regulation, and particle morphology design is rarely reported and deserves much attention. In this study, organic ferric was used to prepare Fe-doped Na3V2(PO4)3@C cathode on the account of low cost, environmental friendliness, and catalytic function of Fe on carbon graphitization. The density functional theory calculation depicts that the most stable site for Fe atom is the V site and moderate replacement of Fe at V position would reduce the band gap energy from 2.19 by 0.43 eV and improve the electron transfer, which is crucial for the intrinsic poor conductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3. The experimental results show that Fe element can be introduced into the bulk structure successfully, modulating relevant structural parameters. In addition, the coated carbon layer graphitization degree is also regulated due to the catalysis function of Fe. And, the decomposition of organic ferric would infuse the formation of porous structure, which can promote electrolyte permeation and shorten the electron/ion diffusion. Finally, the optimized Na3V1.85Fe0.15(PO4)3@C could possess a high capacity of 103.69 mA h g-1 and retain 91.45% after 1200 cycles at 1.0C as well as 94.45 mA h g-1 at 20C. In addition, the excellent performance is comprehensively elucidated via ex situ X-ray diffraction and pseudocapacitance characterization. The multifunction contribution of Fe-doping may provide new clue for designing porous electrode materials and a new sight into Fe-doped carbon-coated material.",

Recently, research and development efforts on room-temperature sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) have been revitalized, as NIBs are considered promising, low-cost alternatives to the current Li-ion battery technology for large-scale applications. Herein, we introduce a novel layered oxide cathode material, Na0.78Ni0.23Mn0.69O2. This new compound provides a high reversible capacity of 138 mAh g-1 and an average potential of 3.25 V vs Na+/Na with a single smooth voltage profile. Its remarkable rate and cycling performances are attributed to the elimination of the P2-O2 phase transition upon cycling to 4.5 V. The first charge process yields an abnormally excess capacity, which has yet to be observed in other P2 layered oxides. Metal K-edge XANES results show that the major charge compensation at the metal site during Na-ion deintercalation is achieved via the oxidation of nickel (Ni2+) ions, whereas, to a large extent, manganese (Mn) ions remain in their Mn4+ state. Interestingly, electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS) results reveal differences in electronic structures in the bulk and at the surface of electrochemically cycled particles. At the surface, transition metal ions (TM ions) are in a lower valence state than in the bulk, and the O K-edge prepeak disappears. On the basis of previous reports on related Li-excess LIB cathodes, it is proposed that part of the charge compensation mechanism during the first cycle takes place at the lattice oxygen site, resulting in a surface to bulk transition metal gradient. We believe that by optimizing and controlling oxygen activity, Na layered oxide materials with higher capacities can be designed.",

        "title": "Strong Anionic Repulsion for Fast Na Kinetics in P2‐Type Layered Oxides",
        "abstract": "An intriguing mechanism for enabling fast Na kinetics during oxygen redox (OR) is proposed to produce high‐power‐density cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) based on the P2‐type oxide models, Na2/3[Mn6/9Ni3/9]O2 (NMNO) and Na2/3[Ti1/9Mn5/9Ni3/9]O2 (NTMNO) using the “potential pillar” effect. The critical structural parameter of NTMNO lowers the Na migration barrier in the desodiated state because the electrostatic repulsion of O(2p)O(2p) that occurs between transition metal layers is combined with the chemically stiff Ti4+(3d)O(2p) bond to locally retain the strong repulsion effect. The NTMNO interlayer distance moderately decreases upon charging with oxygen oxidation, whereas that of NMNO decreases at a much faster rate, which can be explained by the dependence of OR activity on the coordination environment. Fundamental electrochemical experiments clearly indicate that the Ti doping of the bare material significantly improves its rate capability during OR, and detailed electrochemical and structural analyses show much faster Na kinetics for NTMNO than for NMNO. A systematic comparison of the two cathode oxides based on experiments and first‐principles calculations establishes the “potential pillar” concept of not only improving the sluggish Na kinetics upon OR reaction but also harnessing the full potential of the anionic redox for high‐power‐density SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Layered transition‐metal (TM) oxides are ideal hosts for Li+ charge carriers largely due to the occurrence of oxygen charge compensation that stabilizes the layered structure at high voltage. Hence, enabling charge compensation in sodium layered oxides is a fascinating task for extending the cycle life of sodium‐ion batteries. Herein a Ti/Mg co‐doping strategy for a model P2‐Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 cathode material is put forward to activate charge compensation through highly hybridized O2pTM3d covalent bonds. In this way, the interlayer OO electrostatic repulsion is weakened upon deeply charging, which strongly affects the systematic total energy that transforms the striking P2–O2 interlayer contraction into a moderate solid‐solution‐type evolution. Accordingly, the cycling stability of the codoped cathode material is improved superiorly over the pristine sample. This study starts a perspective way of optimizing the sodium layered cathodes by rational structural design coupling electrochemical reactions, which can be extended to widespread battery researches.",

Further, it improves the energy density correlated with the well utilization of all Na in the compound. For Na3V2(PO4)2F3(NVPF), the extraction of the third Na, reported as the electrochemical inactivated, can be realized at a high voltage region while forming an irreversible tetragonal phase. In this study, we introduce Ti doping to the Na2VTi(PO4)2F3(NVTPF) material; we reveal that the Ti-doped NVTPF could effectively suppress the irreversible phase transformation, thus successfully harnessing Na in a wide voltage range. Experimental study discloses that the Ti-substituted Na2VTi(PO4)2F3 could take up the Na+ from Amam phase to Cmc21 phase between 1.0 V and 4.8 V reversibly accounting for the 2 Na+ transportation that shows favorable Na+ kinetics and structural stability.

        "abstract": "Flexible electrode design with robust structure and good performance is one of the priorities for flexible batteries to power emerging wearable electronics, and organic cathode materials have become contenders for flexible self‐supporting electrodes. However, issues such as easy electrolyte solubility and low intrinsic conductivity contribute to high polarization and rapid capacity decay. Herein, we have designed a flexible self‐supporting cathode based on perylene‐3,4,9,10‐tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), interfacial engineering enhanced by polypyrrole (PPy), and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), forming the interconnected and flexible PTCDA/PPy/CNTs using polymerization reaction and vacuum filtration methods, effectively curbing those challenges. When used as the cathode of sodium‐ion batteries, PTCDA/PPy/CNTs exhibit excellent rate capability (105.7 mAh g−1 at 20 C), outstanding cycling stability (79.4% capacity retention at 5 C after 500 cycles), and remarkable wide temperature application capability (86.5 mAh g−1 at −30°C and 115.4 mAh g−1 at 60°C). The sodium storage mechanism was verified to be a reversible oxidation reaction between two Na+ ions and carbonyl groups by density functional theory calculations, in situ infrared Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and in situ Raman spectroscopy. Surprisingly, the pouch cells based on PTCDA/PPy/CNTs exhibit good mechanical flexibility in various mechanical states. This work inspires more rational designs of flexible and self‐supporting organic cathodes, promoting the development of high‐performance and wide‐temperature adaptable wearable electronic devices.",

Importantly, we identify a hierarchical thermal transport mechanism in NaVO3 and the significant contribution of diffusive thermal transport. With the combined two channels, we reveal that NaVO3 has the anisotropic and ultralow thermal conductivity κ, which is derived from the bonding heterogeneity with the coexistence of strong V-O bonds and weak Na-O bonds, implying the possibility of engineering the κ of SIBs by spatially tuning the sodium concentration distribution.

        "abstract": "This study evaluates the effect of equimolar substitution of manganese by cobalt or nickel in hexacyanoferrate (HCF) open frameworks as electrode materials for Na-ion batteries. As the stability of Mn-N bonds is crucial to obtain long term stability and cyclability of manganese (Mn-HCF), the samples were analyzed thoroughly using several spectroscopic and structural methods. The XPS and infrared experiments reveal that the charge density around Fe is modulated by the presence of Co or Ni, which is associated with their high polarizing power, leading to decreased cell distortion as revealed by XRD. The Rietveld refinement demonstrated that the octahedra built by 3d metals and the cyanide nitrogen were distorted with the axial bond distances being larger than the equatorial distances. This octahedral distortion promotes the spin behavior of 3/2 for Mn2+ confirmed by magnetic experiments; the arising of this spin state is attributed to d orbital splitting determined by UV-Vis experiments. Therefore, the changes upon Mn substitution are related to the modification of the covalent character of Mn-N bonds, modulated by the effect of the Ni and Co polarizing power. All these properties improve the electrochemical stability of the Ni or Co substituted materials as Na-ion batteries, leading to higher capacity retention even at higher C-rates (5C) and good capacity recovery, in comparison with those obtained for Mn-HCF.",

However, it still suffers from unsatisfactory stability, caused by the poor reversibility of the V5+/V4+ redox couple and structure evolution. Herein, we propos a strategy that combines high-entropy substitution and electrolyte optimization to boost the reversible multielectron reactions of NVP. The high reversibility of the V5+/V4+ redox couple and crystalline structure evolution are disclosed by in situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectra and in situ X-ray diffraction. Meanwhile, the electrochemical reaction kinetics of high-entropy substitution NVP (HE-NVP) can be further improved in the diglyme-based electrolyte. These enable HE-NVP to deliver a superior electrochemical performance (capacity retention of 93.1% after 2000 cycles; a large reversible capacity of 120 mAh g-1 even at 5.0 A g-1). Besides, the long cycle life and high power density of the HE-NVP∥natural graphite full-cell configuration demonstrated the superiority of HE-NVP cathode in SIBs.

Here, we investigated more than one-electron storage of Na in Na3VCr(PO4)3. Combining a series of advanced characterization techniques such as ex situ 51V solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray absorption near-edge structure, and in situ X-ray diffraction, we reveal that V3+/V4+ and V4+/V5+ redox couples in the materials can be accessed, leading to a 1.5-electron reaction. It is also found that a light change on the local electronic and structural states or phase change could be observed after the first cycle, resulting in the fast capacity fade at room temperature. We also showed that the irreversibility of the phase changes could be largely suppressed at low temperature, thus leading to a much improved electrochemical performance.",

        "abstract": "Li‐ion batteries (LIBs) that can operate under low temperature (LT) conditions are essential for applications in orbital missions, subsea areas, and electric vehicles. Unfortunately, severe capacity loss is witnessed due to tremendous kinetic barriers that emerge at LT. Herein, to surmount such kinetic limitations, a low dielectric environment is tamed throughout the bulk electrolyte, which efficaciously brought the Li+ desolvation energy down to 30.76 kJ mol−1. At the meantime, the adoption of sodium cations (Na+) is proposed as a hetero‐cation additive, and a Li‐Na hybrid and fluoride‐rich interphase is further identified via preferential reduction of Na+‐(solvent/anion) clusters, which is found to efficiently facilitate Li+ migration through the LiF/NaF grain boundaries. Based on a N/P ratio of 1.1, the graphite/LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM) full cell (cathode loading of ≈18.5 mg cm−2) delivers a capacity as high as 125.1 mAh g−1 under −20 °C with prolonged cycling to 100 cycles. Finally, a 270 Wh kg−1 graphite/NCM pouch cell is assembled, which affords a discharge capacity of 108.7 mAh g−1 under −40 °C during the initial cycles. With an eye to both fundamental and practical aspects, this work will propel additional advancements and allow LIBs to fill more roles under extreme operation temperatures than ever before.",

However, low electrical conductivity and dissolution in organic liquid electrolytes hinder their further development.

Under the effect of the electrostatic interaction, organic cathode material, 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), is tightly attached to MXene nanosheets. Owing to the high electronic conductivity and special two-dimensional (2D) structure of MXene nanosheets, the issues of PTCDA cathode are effectively relieved. When applied in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), the MXene@PTCDA heterostructure exhibits significantly enhanced rate capability and cycling performance than bare PTCDA. The heterostructures proposed here can be applied to other (K, Zn, Al, Mg, Ca, etc.) battery systems. In addition to energy storage and conversion, the heterostructures can be also extended to many fields such as catalysis, sensors, electronics, optics, membranes, semiconductors, biomedicines, etc.",

However, their drawbacks of low Se loading, dissolution of intermediate sodium polyselenides in the electrolyte and volumetric expansion of Se impede their real applications. To address these issues, herein, we report a multifunctional Se host with MoSe2 nanosheets coupled with nitrogen-doped porous carbon hollow spheres for the first time. The N-doped hollow carbon sphere structure could provide a large space for Se loading (Se content up to 72 wt%) and accommodate the volume expansion of Se species upon cycling. MoSe2 was chosen as a polar coupling component for the carbon matrix, owing to its low conversion reaction voltage. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the MoSe2 nanosheets coupled with hollow spheres could enhance the adsorption energy of the host to polyselenides chemically, which benefits the immobilization of polyselenides. Therefore, as a cathode for Na-Se batteries, the as-prepared composite exhibits excellent energy storage performance with long cycling life and superior rate performance. Our study of introducing transition metal selenides into Na-Se batteries may stimulate the designing of diverse Se-based cathodes.",

        "abstract": "Sodium (Na) super-ionic conductor structured Na3MnTi(PO4)3 (NMTP) cathodes have garnered interest owing to their cost-effectiveness and high operating voltages. However, the voltage hysteresis phenomenon triggered by Mn Na · ${\\mathrm{Mn}}_{{\\mathrm{Na}}}^{\\mathrm{\\cdot}}$ anti-site defects ( Mn Na · ${\\mathrm{Mn}}_{{\\mathrm{Na}}}^{\\mathrm{\\cdot}}$ -ASD), namely, the occupation of Mn2+ in the Na2 vacancies in NMTP, leads to sluggish diffusion kinetics and low energy efficiency. This study employs an innovative electronic confinement-restrained strategy to achieve the regulation of Mn Na · ${\\mathrm{Mn}}_{{\\mathrm{Na}}}^{\\mathrm{\\cdot}}$ -ASD. Partial replacement of titanium (Ti) with electron-rich vanadium (V) favors strong electronic interactions with Mn2+, restraining Mn2+ migration.

        "abstract": "Based on the favorable ionic conductivity and structural stability, sodium superionic conductor (NASICON) materials especially utilizing multivalent redox reaction of vanadium are one of the most promising cathodes in sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). To further boost their application in large‐scale energy storage production, a rational strategy is to tailor vanadium with earth‐abundant and cheap elements (such as Fe, Mn), reducing the cost and toxicity of vanadium‐based NASICON materials. Here, the Na3.05V1.03Fe0.97(PO4)3 (NVFP) is synthesized with highly conductive Ketjen Black (KB) by ball‐milling assisted sol‐gel method. The pearl‐like KB branch chains encircle the NVFP (p‐NVFP), the segregated particles possess promoted overall conductivity, balanced charge, and modulated crystal structure during electrochemical progress. The p‐NVFP obtains significantly enhanced ion diffusion ability and low volume change (2.99%). Meanwhile, it delivers a durable cycling performance (87.7% capacity retention over 5000 cycles at 5 C) in half cells. Surprisingly, the full cells of p‐NVFP reveal a remarkable capability of 84.9 mAh g−1 at 20 C with good cycling performance (capacity decay rate is 0.016% per cycle at 2 C). The structure modulation of the p‐NVFP provides a rational design on the superiority of others to be put into practice.",

        "title": "High-Performance Single-Crystal Lithium-Rich Layered Oxides Cathode Materials via Na2 WO4 -Assisted Sintering.",
        "abstract": "Single-crystal lithium-rich layered oxides (LLOs) with excellent mechanical properties can enhance their crystal structure stability. However, the conventional methods for preparing single-crystal LLOs, require large amounts of molten salt additives, involve complicated washing steps, and increase the difficulty of large-scale production. In this study, a sodium tungstate (Na2 WO4 )-assisted sintering method is proposed to fabricate high-performance single-crystal LLOs cathode materials without large amounts of additives and additional washing steps. During the sintering process, Na2 WO4 promotes particle growth and forms a protective coating on the surface of LLOs particles, effectively suppressing the side reactions at the cathode/electrolyte interface. Additionally, trace amounts of Na and W atoms are doped into the LLOs lattice via gradient doping. Experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that Na and W doping stabilizes the crystal structure and enhances the Li+ ions diffusion rate. The prepared single-crystal LLOs exhibit outstanding capacity retention of 82.7% (compared to 65.0%, after 200 cycles at 1 C) and a low voltage decay rate of 0.76 mV per cycle (compared to 1.80 mV per cycle). This strategy provides a novel pathway for designing the next-generation high-performance cathode materials for Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).",

        "abstract": "P2 layered oxides have attracted more and more attention as cathode materials of high-power sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). During the charging process, the release of sodium ions leads to layer slip, which leads to the transformation of P2 phase into O2 phase, resulting in a sharp decline in capacity. However, many cathode materials do not undergo P2 -O2 transition during charging and discharging, but form a \"Z\" phase. It is proved that the iron-containing compound Na0.67 Ni0.1 Mn0.8 Fe0.1 O2 formed the \"Z\" phase of the symbiotic structure of the P phase and O phase during high-voltage charging through ex-XRD and HAADF-STEM. During the charging process, the cathode material undergoes a structural change of P2 -OP4 -O2 . With the increase of charging voltage, the O-type superposition mode increases to form an ordered OP4 phase, and the P2 -type superposition mode disappears after further charging to form a pure O2 phase. 57 Fe-Mössbauer spectroscopy revealed that no migration of Fe ions is detected. The O-Ni-O-Mn-Fe-O bond formed in the transition metal MO6 (M = Ni, Mn, Fe) octahedron can inhibit the elongation of the Mn-O bond and improve the electrochemical activity so that P2-Na0.67 Ni0.1 Mn0.8 Fe0.1 O2 has an excellent capacity of 172.4 mAh g-1 and a coulombic efficiency close to 99% at 0.1C.",

        "abstract": "P2-type sodium nickel manganese oxide-based cathode materials with higher energy densities are prime candidates for applications in rechargeable sodium ion batteries. A systematic study combining in situ high energy X-ray diffraction (HEXRD), ex situ X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy (XAFS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SS-NMR) techniques was carried out to gain a deep insight into the structural evolution of P2-Na0.66Ni0.33-xZnxMn0.67O2 (x = 0, 0.07) during cycling. In situ HEXRD and ex situ TEM measurements indicate that an irreversible phase transition occurs upon sodium insertion-extraction of Na0.66Ni0.33Mn0.67O2. Zinc doping of this system results in a high structural reversibility. XAFS measurements indicate that both materials are almost completely dependent on the Ni(4+)/Ni(3+)/Ni(2+) redox couple to provide charge/discharge capacity. SS-NMR measurements indicate that both reversible and irreversible migration of transition metal ions into the sodium layer occurs in the material at the fully charged state. The irreversible migration of transition metal ions triggers a structural distortion, leading to the observed capacity and voltage fading. Our results allow a new understanding of the importance of improving the stability of transition metal layers.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries have recently emerged as a promising alternative to lithium‐based batteries, driven by an ever‐growing demand for electricity storage systems. The present workproposes a cobalt‐free high‐capacity cathode for sodium‐ion batteries, synthesized using a high‐entropy approach. The high‐entropy approach entails mixing more than five elements in a single phase; hence, obtaining the desired properties is a challenge since this involves the interplay between different elements. Here, instead of oxide, oxyfluoride is chosen to suppress oxygen loss during long‐term cycling. Supplement to this, lithium is introduced in the composition to obtain high configurational entropy and sodium vacant sites, thus stabilizing the crystal structure, accelerating the kinetics of intercalation/deintercalation, and improving the air stability of the material. With the optimization of the cathode composition, a reversible capacity of 109 mAh g−1 (2–4 V) and 144 mAh g−1 (2–4.3 V) is observed in the first few cycles, along with a significant improvement in stability during prolonged cycling. Furthermore, in situ and ex situ diffraction studies during charging/discharging reveal that the high‐entropy strategy successfully suppresses the complex phase transition. The impressive outcomes of the present work strongly motivate the pursuit of the high‐entropy approach to develop efficient cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries.",

In this work, a Cu-modified Fe-PB composite (FeCu-PB@CuO) is successfully prepared through regulating the Fe-PB structure by Cu doping and engineering the surface by CuO coating. The density functional theory calculation results confirm that Cu preferentially replaces FeHS in the Fe-PB lattice and Cu doping reduces the bandgap. Our experiment results reveal that CuO coating can provide more active sites, inhibit side reactions, and potentially enhance the activity of FeHS. Due to the synergistic effect of Cu doping and CuO coating, FeCu-PB@CuO has a considerable initial discharge capacity of 123.5 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1. In particular, at 2 A g-1, it delivers an impressive initial capacity of 84.3 mAh g-1, and the capacity decreasing rate of each cycle is only 0.02% over 1500 cycles.

Comparative analysis revealed that the structural and electrochemical properties of Fe-PBA prepared in the microreactor outperformed those of samples prepared using traditional reactors.

        "abstract": "Prussian blue analogues are potential competitive energy storage materials due to their diverse metal combinations and wide three-dimensional ion channels. Here, we prepared a new highly crystalline monoclinic nickel-doped cobalt hexacyanoferrate via a feasible and simple one-step co-precipitation method. In the process of sodium-ion de-intercalation, three stable charge and discharge platforms, which are consistent with the cyclic voltammetry performance, are seen for the first time, showing the function of nickel ions in Prussian blue. Furthermore, the charge transfer and structural evolution caused by the transmission of sodium ions were well revealed via ex situ XRD, ex situ XPS, and in situ EIS studies. Simulation calculations are performed relating to the energy band structure and the highest-occupied bonding orbitals of the system in different charge states, revealing the charge and discharge mechanism of the nickel-doped material and the reason for the emergence of the new platform at low voltages. In addition, NaNi0.17Co0.83Fe(CN)6 also delivers a striking capacity of 146 mA h g-1 and superior cyclability, with 93% capacity retention over 100 cycles; it can be considered as a promising alternative cathode material for use in sodium-ion batteries.",

Herein, we report NASICON-structured Na3MnZr(PO4)3 as a cathode for sodium batteries that exhibits an electrochemical performance superior to those of other manganese phosphate cathodes reported in the literature. Both the Mn4+/Mn3+ and Mn3+/Mn2+ redox couples are reversibly accessed in Na3MnZr(PO4)3, providing high discharge voltage plateaus at 4.0 and 3.5 V, respectively. A high discharge capacity of 105 mAh g-1 was obtained from Na3MnZr(PO4)3 with a small variation of lattice parameters and a small volume change on extraction of two Na+ ions per formula unit. Moreover, Na3MnZr(PO4)3 exhibits an excellent cycling stability, retaining 91% of the initial capacity after 500 charge/discharge cycles at 0.5 C rate. On the basis of structural analysis and density functional theory calculations, we have proposed a detailed desodiation pathway from Na3MnZr(PO4)3 where Mn and Zr are disordered within the structure. We further show that the cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion of Mn3+ is suppressed in the cathode and that Na2MnZr(PO4)3 is a stable phase.",

        "abstract": "A new paradigm based on an anionic O2-/On- redox reaction has been highlighted in high-energy-density cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries, achieving a high voltage (~4.2 V vs. Na+/Na) with a large anionic capacity during the first charge process. The structural variations during (de)intercalation are closely correlated with stable cycleability. To determine the rational range of the anion-based redox reaction, the structural origins of Na1-xRu0.5O1.5 (0≤x≤1.0) were deduced from its vacancy(□)/Na atomic configurations, which trigger different coulombic interactions between the cations and anions. In the cation-based Ru4+/Ru5+ redox reaction, the □-solubility into fully sodiated Na2RuO3 predominantly depends on the crystallographic 4h-site when 0.0≤x≤0.25, and coulombic repulsion of the linear O2--□-O2- configuration is accompanied by increased volumetric strain. Further Na extraction (0.25≤x≤0.5) induces a compensation effect leading to Na2/3[Na□Ru2/3]O2 with the □-formation of 2b and 2c sites, which drastically reduce the volumetric strain. In the O2-/On- anionic redox region (0.5≤x≤0.75), Na removal at the 4h site generates a repulsive force in O2--□-O2- that increases the interlayer distance. Finally, in the 0.75≤x≤1.0 region, the anionic O charges are unprotected by repulsive forces and their consumption causes severe volumetric strain in Na1-xRu0.5O1.5. Coupling our mechanistic understanding of the structural origin with the □- and Na-site preferences and the coulombic interaction between lattice O and vacancies in Na1-xRu0.5O1.5, we determined the rational range of the anionic redox reaction in layered cathode materials for rechargeable battery research.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have captured widespread attention for grid-scale energy storage owing to the wide distribution and low cost of sodium resources. Delivery of high energy density with stable retention remains a challenge in developing cathode candidates for rechargeable SIBs. Inspired by the concept of \"cationic potential\", here, we present a hierarchical crystalline domain in hexagonal particles with target chemical composition (Na0.8Li0.03Mg0.05Ni0.28Fe0.05Mn0.54Ti0.05O2) from the inner bulk O3 phase (71.1 wt %) to the outer P2-type shell (28.9 wt %) of the structure. Benefiting from the mitigated mechanical stress of the predominant bulk O3 phase under the protection of the surficial P2 crystalline domain at the microscale during Na+ (de)intercalation, the brittle fracture, plastic yielding, and structural damage of the bulk O3 phase are effectively prohibited during battery cycling, thereby achieving good structural integrity. As a consequence, the biphasic P2/O3-Na0.8Li0.03Mg0.05Ni0.28Fe0.05Mn0.54Ti0.05O2 material exhibits satisfactory electrochemical properties, with a high energy density of 506 Wh kg-1 and good capacity retention of 85.5% over 200 cycles.

Herein, we successfully constructed a three-dimensional cross-linked porous architecture NMTP material (AsN@NMTP/C) by a natural microbe of Aspergillus niger (AsN), and the structure of different NMTP cathodes was optimized by adjusting different transition metal Mn/Ti ratios. Both approaches effectively altered the three-dimensional NMTP structure, not only improving electronic conductivity and controlling Na+ diffusion pathways but also enhancing the electrochemical kinetics of the material. The resultant AsN@NMTP/C-650, sintered at 650 °C, exhibits better electrochemical performance with higher reversible three-electron reactions corresponding to the voltage platforms of Ti4+/3+, Mn3+/2+, and Mn4+/3+ around 2.1, 3.6, and 4.1 V (vs Na+/Na), respectively. The capacity retention rate is up to 89.3% after 1000 cycles at a 2C rate.

        "abstract": "Sodium layered oxide with anion redox activity (SLO‐A) stands out as a promising cathode material for sodium‐ion batteries due to its impressive capacity and high voltage resulting from Mn‐ and O‐redox processes. However, the SLO‐A faces significant challenges in cycling stability and rate performance, primarily due to the poor reversibility and sluggish kinetics of the O‐redox. In this study,a novel Ti‐doped material, Na2/3Li2/9Mn53/72Ti1/24O2 (NLMTO), exhibiting remarkable characteristics such as a notable rate capacity (130 mAh g−1 at 3C, where 1C equals 200 mA g−1) and excellent cycling retention (85.4% after 100 cycles at 0.5C) is introduced. Employing electrochemical differential analyses, the contributions to the superior performance arising from the Mn‐ and O‐redox processes are quantitatively delineated. The optimized performance of NLMTO is attributed, in part, to the enhanced stability of both bulk and interface structures. The introduction of Ti through substitution not only contributes to this stability but also allows for the fine‐tuning of the material's electron configurations. This is achieved by augmenting the density of states near the Fermi energy level, as well as elevating the O 2p and Mn 3d orbits. This research advances sodium‐ion battery technology.",

We synthesize an N-doped graphene oxide wrapped Na 3 V(PO 3 ) 3 N composite with a uniform carbon coating layer, and it shows both excellent rate performance and outstanding cycling stability.

Its three-dimensional sodium diffusion pathways are explicitly demonstrated with distinctive low energy barriers. Higher reversible capacity and a higher working platform can surely be achieved if the electrolyte possesses a wider voltage tolerance window above 4.8 V.

Therefore, designing an ideal host material to suppress the polysulfides shuttle process and accelerate the redox reactions of soluble NaPSs to Na2S2/Na2S is of paramount importance for RT Na–S batteries. Here, a quasi‐solid‐state transformation of NaPSs is realized by building high efficiency MoC‐W2C heterostructure in freestanding multichannel carbon nanofibers via electrospinning and calcination methods (MoC‐W2C‐MCNFs). The multichannel carbon nanofibers are interlinked micro‐mesoporous structures that can accommodate volume change of electrode materials and confine the entire redox process of NaPSs (restraining the polysulfides shuttle process). Meanwhile, the MoC‐W2C heterostructure with abundant heterointerfaces can facilitate electron/ion transport and accelerate conversion of NaPSs. Consequently, the S/MoC‐W2C‐MCNFs cathode delivers a high capacity of 640 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 0.2 A g−1 and an excellent reversible performance of 200 mAh g−1 after ultralong 3500 cycles at 4 A g−1.

Herein, excellent Na-storage performance in fluorophosphate (Na3 V2 (PO4 )2 F3 ) cathode is achieved by lattice regulation based on charge balance theory. Lattice regulation of aliovalent Mn2+ for V3+ increases both electronic conductivity and Na+ -migration kinetics. Because of the maintaining of electrical neutrality in the material, aliovalent Mn2+ -introduced leads to the coexistence of V3+ and V4+ from charge balance theory. It decreases the particle size and improves the structural stability, suppressing the large lattice distortion during cathode reaction processes. These multiple effects enhance the specific capacity (123.8 mAh g-1 ), outstanding high-rate (68% capacity retention at 20 C), ultralong cycle (only 0.018% capacity attenuation per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1 C) and low-temperature (96.5% capacity retention after 400 cycles at -25 °C) performances of Mn2+ -induced Na3 V1.98 Mn0.02 (PO4 )2 F3 when used as cathode in SIBs.

In this study, we investigate the origin of capacity fading in P2-type layered sodium cathode materials for SIBs using a micron-sized single-crystalline P2-Na x Mn 3/4 Ni 1/4 O 2 model cathode active material. Using various electrochemical techniques, we identify the following aging effects upon cycling: (i) a state of charge (SOC)- independent increase in polarization, (ii) a SOC-dependent increase in polarization at high voltage, and (iii) a loss of active material due to electronic disconnection after prolonged cycling. With high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, we identify surface densification, resulting in 5 − 10 nm thick surface layers on cycled cathode active materials as the origin for SOC-independent increase of polarization. The corresponding oxygen loss is in accordance with gas evolution in differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) measurements. Furthermore, with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) electrode cross sections, we identify (partly) reversible cracking at a high SOC as the cause for increased polarization depending on SOC. Operando X-ray diffraction (XRD) identifies significant anisotropic volume change, which suggests mechanical stress as the cause for cracking at a high SOC and loss of active material after prolonged cycling.

        "title": "Superlattice‐Stabilized WSe2 Cathode for Rechargeable Aluminum Batteries",
        "abstract": "Rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs), with abundant aluminum reserves, low cost, and high safety, give them outstanding advantages in the postlithium batteries era. However, the high charge density (364 C mm−3) and large binding energy of three‐electron‐charge aluminum ions (Al3+) de‐intercalation usually lead to irreversible structural deterioration and decayed battery performance. Herein, to mitigate these inherent defects from Al3+, an unexplored family of superlattice‐type tungsten selenide‐sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) (S‐WSe2) cathode in RABs with a stably crystal structure, expanded interlayer, and enhanced Al‐ion diffusion kinetic process is proposed. Benefiting from the unique advantage of superlattice‐type structure, the anionic surfactant SDBS in S‐WSe2 can effectively tune the interlayer spacing of WSe2 with released crystal strain from high‐charge‐density Al3+ and achieve impressively long‐term cycle stability (110 mAh g−1 over 1500 cycles at 2.0 A g−1). Meanwhile, the optimized S‐WSe2 cathode with intrinsic negative attraction of SDBS significantly accelerates the Al3+ diffusion process with one of the best rate performances (165 mAh g−1 at 2.0 A g−1) in RABs. The findings of this study pave a new direction toward durable and high‐performance electrode materials for RABs.",

        "title": "Suppressing Cation Migration and Reducing Particle Cracks in a Layered Fe-Based Cathode for Advanced Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have huge potential in large-scale energy storage applications. Layered Fe-based oxides are one of the desirable cathode materials due to abundance in the earth crust and high activity in electrochemical processes. However, Fe-ion migration to Na layers is one of the major hurdles leading to irreversible structural degradation. Herein, it is revealed that distinct Fe-ion migration in cycling NaFeO2 (NFO) should be mainly responsible for the strong local lattice strain and resulting particle cracks, all of which results in the deterioration of electrochemical performance. More importantly, a strategy of Ru doping could effectively suppress the Fe-ion migration and then reduce the local lattice strain and the particle cracks, finally to greatly enhance the sodium storage performance. Atomic-scale characterization shows that NFO electrode after cycling presents the intense lattice strain locally, accompanied by the remarkable particle cracks. Whereas, Ru-doped NFO electrode maintains the well-ordered layered structure by inhibiting the Fe-O distortion, so as to eliminate the resulting side effect. As a result, Ru-doped NFO could greatly improve the comprehensive electrochemical performance by delivering a reversible capacity of 120 mA h g-1 , about 80% capacity retention after 100 cycles. The findings provide new insights for designing high-performance electrodes for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Development of high-performance cathode materials is one of the key challenges in the practical application of sodium-ion batteries. Among all the cathode materials, layered sodium transition-metal oxides are particularly attractive. However, undesired phase transitions are often reported and have detrimental effects on the structure stability and electrochemical performance. Cu substitution of zinc in the P2-type Na0.6Mn0.7Ni0.15Zn0.15-xCuxO2 (x = 0, 0.075, and 0.15) composites was investigated in this study for mitigating the biphase transition and enhancing the electrochemical performance of sodium-ion batteries. The coupling effect of Zn and Cu enables an excellent capacity retention of 96.4% of the initial discharge capacity after 150 cycles at 0.1 C in the Na/Na0.6Mn0.7Ni0.15Zn0.075Cu0.075O2 cell. The biphase transition that occurred in the high voltage range has been significantly suppressed after the incorporation of Cu in Na0.6Mn0.7Ni0.15Zn0.15O2, which was confirmed by in situ X-ray diffraction studies. Moreover, the substitution of the inert element Zn with electrochemically active Cu leads to the suppression of anionic redox and the occurrence of Cu2+/3+ redox reaction, and the electrolyte decomposition is impeded after the introduction of electrochemically active Cu in the Na0.6Mn0.7Ni0.15Zn0.15-xCuxO2 composite cathode. The enhanced electrochemical performance in the Na0.6Mn0.7Ni0.15Zn0.075Cu0.075O2 electrode can be ascribed to the coexistence of Zn and Cu and alleviated volumetric change as well as suppressed electrode/electrolyte side reaction after Cu substitution.",

        "abstract": "Iron trifluoride (FeF3), a conversion-type cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), is based on cheap and abundant Fe and provides high theoretical capacity. However, the applications of FeF3-based SIBs have been hindered by their low-capacity utilization and poor cycling stability. Herein, we report greatly enhanced performance of FeF3 in multiple types of ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes at both room temperature (RT) and elevated temperatures. The Pyr1,4FSI electrolyte demonstrated the best cycling stability with an unprecedented decay rate of only ∼0.023% per cycle after the initial stabilization and an average coulombic efficiency of ∼99.5% for over 1000 cycles at RT. The Pyr1,3FSI electrolyte demonstrated the best cycling stability with a capacity decay rate of only ∼0.25% per cycle at 60 °C. Cells using Pyr1,3FSI and EMIMFSI electrolytes also showed promising cycling stability with capacity decay rates of ∼0.039% and ∼0.030% per cycle over 1000 cycles, respectively. A protective and ionically conductive cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer is formed during cycling in ILs, diminishing side reactions that commonly lead to gassing and excessive CEI growth in organic electrolytes, especially at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the increased ionic conductivity and decreased viscosity of ILs at elevated temperatures help attain higher accessible capacity. The application of ILs sheds light on designing a protective CEI for its use in stable SIBs.",

Nevertheless, they still suffer fast capacity loss and voltage decay, as a result of the layered structure instability upon extended electrochemical cycling. The mechanism underlying such instability remains poorly understood. Here we unravel the TM migrations and structural evolution of a quaternary NaNi0.3Co0.12Mn0.18Fe0.4O2 compound during electrochemical cycling using atomic resolution electron microscopy and associated spectroscopies. We discover successive migrations of TM ions to Na layers that account for structure and performance degradations. The Fe ions migrate into the interstices of both tetrahedra and octahedra of the layers, whereas the Ni ions dominantly in the octahedral ones, and the Mn and Co ions mostly remain in the TM layers. Direct atomic-level observations of the TM migration process upon cycling offer a deep insight into designing high capacity and high cycle lifespan cathode materials for sodium ion batteries.",

A double-tilt TEM heating holder was used to directly characterize the changes in the morphology and the crystallographic and electronic structures of the materials with increase in temperature. The electron diffraction patterns and the electron energy loss spectra demonstrated the presence of cobalt oxides (Co3O4, CoO) and even metallic cobalt (Co) at higher temperatures as a result of reduction of Co ions and loss of oxygen. The bright-field TEM images revealed that the surface of NaxCoO2 becomes porous at high temperatures. Higher cutoff voltages result in degrading thermal stability of NaxCoO2. The observations herein provide a valuable insight that thermal stability is one of the important factors to be considered in addition to the electrochemical properties when developing new electrode materials for novel battery systems.",

However, the high diffusion barrier has hindered its application. In this work, we have theoretically studied the relationship between the strain and the diffusion barrier/path of sodium ions in layered CrN2 by first-principles calculation. Our results show that the strain can not only effectively decrease the diffusion barrier but also change the sodium diffusion path, which can be realized by alkali metal intercalation. Moreover, the diffusion barrier is as low as 0.04 eV with the Cs atoms embedding in layered CrN2 (Cs1/16CrN2), suggesting an excellent candidate cathode for SIBs. In addition, the decrease of the barrier mainly originated from the fact that interlayer electronic coupling weakened with the increase of interlayer spacing. Our findings provide an effective way to enhance sodium diffusion performance, which is beneficial for the design of SIB electrode materials.",

Phosphate compounds are promising materials for sodium-ion batteries because of their high structural stability, energy densities and capacities. Vanadium phosphates have shown high energy densities, but their sodium-ion diffusion and cation doping properties are not fully rationalized. In this work, we combine density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations to study the electronic structure, ion diffusion and cation doping properties of the Na4VO(PO4)2 compound. The calculated Na-ion activation energy of this compound is 0.49 eV, which is typical for Na-based cathode materials, and the simulations predict a Na-ion diffusion coefficient of 5.1 × 10-11 cm2 s-1. The cell voltage trends show a voltage of 3.3 V vs. Na/Na+. Partial substitution of vanadium atoms by other metals (Al3+, Co2+, Fe3+, Mn4+, Ni2+ or Ti4+) increases the cell voltage up to 1.1 V vs. Na/Na+.

        "abstract": "Transition metal layered oxide materials with a general formula NaxMO2 (M=Ni, Mn, Co, Fe) are widely researched with various possible electrode configurations. A significant improvement in structural and electrochemical performance is required to broaden the future applications of sodium‐based layered oxide materials for Na‐ion batteries. In this work, O3‐type NaNi(1‐x)/2Mn(1‐x)/2MoxO2 (x=0, 0.05,0.1) layered oxide cathode materials were synthesized by solid‐state reaction method, and its structural, thermal and electrochemical performance in Sodium (Na) ion battery was investigated. The structural analysis reveals that a single phase highly crystalline O3‐type cathode material with irregular particle shape was formed. The introduction of molybdenum (Mo) improves the thermal stability of cathode materials, which can be attributed to the improved TMO2 layers that provide stability to the material. The addition of Mo to Na layered oxide cathode materials influences their electrochemical performance. In comparison, the developed cathode materials, the NaNi0.475Mn0.475Mo0.05O2, exhibited excellent specific discharge capacity (∽154mAh/g) at C/20 rate, (an increase of ∽20% when compared to the NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2) which can be attributed to the increased capacitance effect by the addition of Mo. The EIS study reveals that the diffusion of Na+ into/from the host structure is rapid during the first cycle and then gradually reduces with subsequent cycling due to the formation of the SEI layer, which hinders Na+ migration. This has a potential effect on the improved electrochemical performance of the material.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

Conducted with lower charging cut-off voltage (4.0 V), P2-type cathode will be easier to trigger the reversible oxygen behaviors and delivers a larger capacity, better rate performance as well as stable cyclability, in contrast to the O3-type cathode. Moreover, within O3-type structure, increasing charging potential (beyond 4.3 V) would induce additional anionic oxidation capacity, but inevitably lead to the irreversible evolution of gaseous O2 and superoxo.

This study introduces a systematic methodology that leverages the meta-heuristically assisted NSGA-II algorithm to optimize multi-element doping in electrode materials, aiming to transcend conventional trial-and-error methods and enhance cathode capacity by the synergistic integration of P2 and O3 phases. A comprehensive phase analysis of the meta-heuristically designed cathode material Na0.76Ni0.20Mn0.42Fe0.30Mg0.04Ti0.015Zr0.025O2 (D-NFMO) is presented, showcasing its remarkable initial reversible capacity of 175.5 mAh g-1 and exceptional long-term cyclic stability in sodium cells. The investigation of structural composition and the stabilizing mechanisms is performed through the integration of multiple characterization techniques. Remarkably, the irreversible phase transition of P2→OP4 in D-NFMO is observed to be dramatically suppressed, leading to a substantial enhancement in cycling stability. The comparison with the pristine cathode (P-NFMO) offers profound insights into the long-term electrochemical stability of D-NFMO, highlighting its potential as a high-voltage cathode material utilizing abundant earth elements in SIBs.

        "abstract": "P2-type cobalt-free MnNi-based layered oxides are promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high reversible capacity and well chemical stability. However, the phase transformations during repeated (dis)charge steps lead to rapid capacity decay and deteriorated Na+ diffusion kinetics. Moreover, the electrode manufacturing based on polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) binder system has been reported with severely defluorination issue as well as the energy intensive and expensive process due to the use of toxic and volatile N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent. It calls for designing a sustainable, better performing, and cost-effective binder for positive electrode manufacturing. In this work, we investigated inorganic sodium metasilicate (SMS) as a viable binder in conjunction with P2-Na0.67Mn0.55Ni0.25Fe0.1Ti0.1O2 (NMNFT) cathode material for SIBs. The NMNFT-SMS electrode delivered a superior electrochemical performance compared to carboxy methylcellulose (CMC) and PVDF based electrodes with a reversible capacity of ~161 mAh/g and retaining ~83% after 200 cycles. Lower cell impedance and faster Na+ diffusion was also observed in this binder system. With these findings, SMS binder can be proposed as a powerful multifunctional binder to enable positive electrode manufacturing of SIBs and to overall reduce battery manufacturing costs.",

Following a strategy of using lithium doping in the transition-metal layer to stabilize the desodiated structure, we have designed and successfully synthesized a novel layered oxide cathode P2-Na0.66Li0.18Fe0.12Mn0.7O2, which demonstrated a high  capacity of 190 mAh g-1 and a remarkably high capacity retention of ∼87% after 80 cycles within a wide voltage range of 1.5-4.5 V.

Considering the relative ionic and Stokes radii and open frameworks with large tunnels, Na-based compounds can act as versatile cathodes for monovalent Li-ion and post-Li-ion batteries. Here, tunnel-type sodium insertion material Na0.44MnO2 is demonstrated as an intercalation host for Li-ion and K-ion batteries. The rod-shaped Na0.44MnO2 was synthesized by a solution combustion method assuming an orthorhombic structure (space group Pbam), which led to Na0.11K0.27MnO2 (NKMO) and Na0.18Li0.51MnO2 (NLMO) cathodes for K-ion batteries and Li-ion batteries, respectively, via facile electrochemical ion exchange from Na0.44MnO2. These new compositions, NKMO and NLMO, exhibited capacities of ∼74 and 141 mAh g-1, respectively (at a rate of C/20), with excellent cycling stability. The underlying mechanistic aspects (structural changes and charge storage mechanism) in these cathode compositions were probed by combining ex situ structural, spectroscopy, and electrochemical tools.

        "abstract": "O3‐type layered oxides are considered as one of the most promising cathode materials for rechargeable sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) due to their appealing energy density and feasible synthesis. Nevertheless, it undergoes complicated phase transitions and pronounced structural degradation during the cycling of charge/discharge process, rendering severe volumetric strain and poor cycling performance. Herein, a zero‐strain high‐entropy NaNi0.2Fe0.2Mn0.35Cu0.05Zn0.1Sn0.1O2 cathode for SIBs is presented by high‐entropy phase stabilization engineering. It is verified that this low‐nickel cobalt‐free high‐entropy cathode can deliver a highly reversible phase evolution, zero volumetric strain, and a significantly improved cycling performance in full cells (87% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 3.0 C). Combining X‐ray absorption spectra and first‐principles calculations, the varied elemental functions in the high‐entropy framework are clearly elucidated, namely, Ni/Fe/Cu acts as charge compensators, while Mn/Zn/Sn serve as interlayer slipping inhibitors through enhanced charge localization besides their stable valence states. By addressing the volumetric strain and cycling instability concerns for O3‐type cathode materials, this work presents a promising strategy for inhibiting irreversible phase transitions and structural degradation in intercalation electrodes, which significantly boosts the development of commercially feasible cathodes for high‐performance SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Polyanionic Na3V2(PO4)2F3 with a NASICON‐type structure is heralded as a promising cathode material for sodium‐ion batteries due to its fast ionic conduction, high working voltage, and favorable structural stability. However, a number of challenging issues remain regarding its rate capability and cycle life, which must be addressed to enable greater application compatibility. Here, a facile and effective approach that can be used to overcome these disadvantages by introducing an aqueous carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binder is reported. The resulting conductive network serves to accelerate the diffusion of Na+ ions across the interface as well as in the bulk. The strong binding force of the CMC and stable solid permeable interface protect the electrode from degradation, leading to an excellent capacity of 75 mA h g−1 at an ultrahigh rate of 70 C (1 C = 128 mA g−1) and a long lifespan of 3500 cycles at 30 C while sustaining 79% of the initial capacity value. A full cell based on this electrode material delivers an impressive energy density as high as 216 W h kg−1, indicating the potential for application of this straightforward and cost‐effective route for the future development of advanced battery technologies.",

        "abstract": "First principles calculations were performed to investigate the electrochemical performance (voltage, cycling stability, electrical conductivity, mechanical properties and safety) of the bulk phase and surface structures of Na3TMPO4CO3 (TM = Fe, Mn, Co, Ni). Na3FePO4CO3 and Na3MnPO4CO3 are estimated to be promising candidates for the cathode materials of sodium ion batteries because of the moderate voltages, good stability and high safety during the cycling process of two sodium ions per formula unit. For the purpose of improving the rate performances, Na3MnPO4CO3 was chosen as an example to explore its surface performance. The surface energies, equilibrium morphology, redox potentials and electronic conductivities of surfaces are explored in detail. The results suggest that (010), (001), (111) and (110) orientations are the dominating surfaces in the Wulff shape, while the surfaces (010) and (001) possess high second surface redox potentials, corresponding to the unsatisfactory specific capacity and ionic conductivity. Moreover, low surface band gaps are discovered in all orientations, which gives a good explanation for the enhanced electronic conductivity as a consequence of decreasing particle size. In addition, the (110), (101) and (12-1) surfaces display significantly lower surface band gaps and comparatively lower second redox potentials, thus enlarging the relative surface areas of surfaces (110), (101) and (12-1) could be an efficient methodology to further improve the specific capacity and electronic conductivity of the Na3MnPO4CO3 material.",

Herein, we propose an efficient structural evolution strategy from biphase to monophase of Na0.766+xLixNi0.33−xMn0.5Fe0.1Ti0.07O2 through Li+ substitution. The role of Li+ substitution not only simplifies the unfavorable phase transition by altering the local coordination of transition metal (TM) cations but also stabilizes the cathode–electrolyte interphase to prevent the degradation of TM cations during battery cycling.

However, its poor electronic conductivity and severe volume expansion during sodium storage need to be addressed before its intensive application could be realized. Herein, we synthesize boron-doped NVP through a facile electrospinning method. By adding boric acid into the reaction mixture during electrospinning followed by carbonization, boron could be directly inserted into the carbon matrix, giving rise to B-doped carbon nanofiber wrapped NVP. By tuning the doping amount, the boron-containing configurations can be facilely manipulated which play different roles in promoting the sodium storage properties of the composite. Based on the calculation results, BC 2 O enhances sodium diffusion by lowering the energy barrier, while BCO 2 improves the structural stability. Due to these specific functionalities of the configurations, the as-prepared composite with a balanced amount of BC 2 O and BCO 2 demonstrates superior sodium storage capacity of 113 mA h g -1 at 1 C, outstanding long cycling performance of 103 mA h g -1 at 10 C and retains 91 mA h g -1 after 1500 cycles.

        "abstract": "Copper Sulfide (CuS) semiconductors have garnered interest, but the effect of transition metal doping on charge carrier kinetics and bandgap remains unclear. In this study, the interactions between dopant atoms (Nickel, Cobalt, and Manganese) and the CuS lattice using spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis are explored. The findings show that sp-d exchange interactions between band electrons and the dopant ions, which replace Cu2+, are key to altering the material's properties. Specifically, these interactions result in a reduced bandgap by shifting the conduction and valence band edges and increasing carrier concentration. It is observed that undoped CuS nanoflowers exhibit a carrier lifetime of 2.16 ns, whereas Mn-doped CuS shows an extended lifetime of 2.62 ns. This increase is attributed to longer carrier scattering times (84 ± 5 fs for Mn-CuS compared to 53 ± 14 fs for CuS) and slower trapping (∼1.5 ps) with prolonged de-trapping (∼100 ps) rates. These dopant-induced energy levels enhance mobility and carrier lifetime by reducing recombination rates. This study highlights the potential of doped CuS as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries and emphasizes the applicability of metal sulfides in energy solutions.",

        "abstract": "Layered P2-Na0.67Mn0.67Ni0.33O2 has been considered an attractive cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, it is still burdened with hazardous phase transformation of P2-O2 under high voltage and harmful reactions at the interface of the electrode and electrolyte. These result in unfavorable structural degradation and rapid capacity decay. Herein, a gradient Mg2+ doping approach is proposed to trigger a structural transformation. During the annealing process, the bulk-diffused Mg2+ and surface residual Mg2+ induce the formation of the P2/P3@MgO structure. Consequently, this method combines the merits of the composite phases, bulk doping, and surface modification. In consequence, Na+ diffusion kinetics and electrochemical performances are remarkably enhanced. The cells using P2/P3@MgO show 69.7% capacity retention at 0.2 C within a voltage range of 1.5-4.5 V for 100 cycles, compared with the 42.6% for P2-Na0.67Mn0.67Ni0.33O2.

        "abstract": "O3-type layered oxides with high initial sodium content are promising cathode candidates for Na-ion batteries. However, affected by the undesired transition metal slab sliding and reaction with H2O/CO2, their further application is typically hindered by unsatisfactory cycling stability upon charging to high voltage and poor storage stability under humid air. Herein, we demonstrate a Fe/Ti cosubstitution strategy to simultaneously enhance the electrochemical performance and storage stability of pristine O3-NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 cathode material, via employing high redox potential and inactive stabilized dopants. The resultant Fe/Ti cosubstituted Na0.95Ni0.40Fe0.15Mn0.3Ti0.15O2 undergoes highly reversible O3-P3-OP2 phase transitions with a small cell volume change of 2.8%, instead of complex O3-O'3-P3-P'3-P3'-O1 phase transitions in NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2. Consequently, the cathode displays a high specific capacity of 161.6 mAh g-1 with an average working voltage of 3.28 V and 81.8% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 5C. Furthermore, the cathode material remains very stable after exposure to air for 7 days and even after soaking in water for 1 h, owing to the prohibition of sodium losing by elevating redox potential and contracting sodium layer spacing. This work proposes an effective method to enhance the electrochemical performance and storage stability of O3-type layered oxide cathodes and promises advancing Na-ion batteries toward large-scale industrialization.",

        "abstract": "A rechargeable Zn-ion battery is a promising aqueous system, where coinsertion of Zn2+ and H+ could address the obstacles of the sluggish ionic transport in cathode materials imposed by multivalent battery chemistry. However, there is a lack of fundamental understanding of this dual-ion transport, especially the potentiodynamics of the storage process. Here, a quantitative analysis of Zn2+ and H+ transport in a disordered sodium vanadate (NaV3O8) cathode material has been reported. Collectively, synchrotron X-ray analysis shows that both Zn2+ and H+ storages follow an intercalation storage mechanism in NaV3O8 and proceed in a sequential manner, where intercalations of 0.26 Zn2+ followed by 0.24 H+ per vanadium atom occur during discharging, while reverse dynamics happens during charging. Such a unique and synergistic dual-ion sequential storage favors a high capacity (265 mA h g-1) and an energy density (221 W h kg-1) based on the NaV3O8 cathode and a great cycling life (a capacity retention of 78% after 2000 cycles) in Zn/NaV3O8 full cells.",

The distances between the adjacent layers of VNT, Fe-VNTs and orthorhombic V2O5 are 2.7 nm, 1.2 nm and 0.44 nm, respectively. The larger interlamellar spacing results in faster Na+ diffusion reaction kinetics, and the insertion of ferric ion into vanadium oxide layers removes the organic templates between the vanadium oxide layers, leading to high conductivity and small electrochemical reaction resistance.

        "abstract": "Understanding polysulfide electrochemistry in high temperature sodium-sulfur (HT-Na-S) batteries is crucial for their practical applications. Currently the discharge capacity of commercial HT-Na-S battery achieves only one third of its theoretical capacity due to polysulfides formation, understanding of which is limited due to technical difficulty in direct imaging polysulfides. Herein, in situ transmission electron microscopy implemented with a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) heating device is used to investigate the electrochemical reactions of HT-Na-S batteries. The formation and evolution of transient polysulfides during cycling are revealed in real-time. Upon discharge, sulfur transforms to long-chain polysulfides, short-chain polysulfides, and finally Na2 S or its mixture with polysulfides, and the process is reversible during charge at high temperatures. Surprisingly, by introducing nanovoids into the sulfur cathode to buffer the large volume change thus preserving the integrity of the electronic/ionic pathways and reducing the diffusion distance of Na+ ions, the sulfur cathode is fully discharged to Na2 S rather than the conventionally observed Na2 S2 at 300 °C. Moreover, the electrochemical reaction is swift and highly reversible. The in situ studies provide not only new understanding to the polysulfide electrochemistry, but also critical strategies to boost the capacity and cyclability of HT-Na-S batteries for large-scale energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "The stable phase transformation during electrochemical progress drives extensive research on vanadium‐based polyanions in sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), especially Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP). And the electron transfer between V3+/4+ redox couple in NVP could be generally achieved, owing to the confined crystal variation during battery service. However, the more favorable V4+/5+ redox couple is still in hard‐to‐access situation due to the high barrier and further brings about the corresponding inefficiency in energy densities. In this work, the multilevel redox in NVP frame (MLNP) alters reaction pathway to undergo homeostatic solid solution process and breaks the high barrier of V4+/5+ at high voltage, taking by progressive transition metal (V, Fe, Ti, and Cr) redox couple. The diversified reaction paths across diffusion barriers could be realized by distinctive release/uptake of inactive Na1 site, confirmed by the calculations of density functional theory. Thereby its volume change is merely 1.73% during the multielectron‐transfer process (≈2.77 electrons). MLNP cathode could achieve an impressive energy density of 440 Wh kg−1, driving the leading development of MLNP among other NASICON structure SIBs. The integration of multiple redox couples with low strain modulates the reaction pathway effectively and will open a new avenue for fabricating high‐performance cathodes in SIBs.",

However, the cyclic stability of NaCrO2 needs to be further improved in order to compete with other state-of-the-art NIB cathodes. In this study, we show that Cr2O3-coated and Al-doped NaCrO2, which is synthesized through a simple one-pot synthesis, can achieve unprecedented cyclic stability. We confirm the preferential formation of a Cr2O3 shell and a Na(Cr1-2xAl2x)O2 core, rather than xAl2O3/NaCrO2 or Na1/1+2x(Cr1/1+2xAl2x/1+2x)O2, through spectroscopic and microscopic methods. The core/shell compounds exhibit superior electrochemical properties compared to either Cr2O3-coated NaCrO2 without Al dopants or Al-doped NaCrO2 without shells because of their synergistic contributions. As a result, Na(Cr0.98Al0.02)O2 with a thin Cr2O3 layer (5 nm) shows no capacity fading during 1000 charge/discharge cycles while maintaining the rate capability of pristine NaCrO2. In addition, the compound is inert against humid air and water. We also discuss the reasons for the excellent performance of Cr2O3-coated Na(Cr1-2xAl2x)O2.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have grabbed worldwide attention as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries on account of the abundance and accessibility of the sodium element in nature. For the sake of meeting the requirements for various applications containing grid-scale energy storage system, electric vehicles, and so forth, a stable and high-voltage cathode is decisive to enhance the energy and power density of SIBs. In this research, sodium super ionic conductor structured Na3V1.5-xCr0.5+x(PO4)3 with different V/Cr ratios to balance the V3+/V4+ and V4+/V5+ redox couples was investigated as the potential cathode for SIBs. Among these candidates, Na3V1.3Cr0.7(PO4)3 manifested high energy density together with good cycling performance and rate capability. Combining the structural analysis and density functional theory calculation, the underlying mechanism of V3+ substitution by Cr3+ was uncovered, accounting for the improvement of electrochemical performance.",

        "title": "Carboxymethylcellulose Induced the Formation of Amorphous MnO2 Nanosheets With Abundant Oxygen Vacancies for Fast Ion Diffusion in Aqueous Zinc‐Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "Manganese dioxide with high theoretical capacity has drawn a great deal of attention for aqueous zinc‐ion batteries (ZIBs). Nevertheless, their sluggish diffusion kinetics, low electrical conductivity and limited active sites are still hindering the potential application in batteries. Herein, amorphous MnO2 nanosheets with abundant oxygen vacancies are facilely prepared by using carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC) as a capping agent. During the growth process, CMC can preferentially attach to the (003) facet of MnO2 to guide its crystal growth and morphology. The small nanosheets can expose abundant edge sites, along with the surface oxygen vacancies, to facilitate the insertion/extraction of H+ and Zn2+ in ZIBs. Moreover, the presence of CMC can stabilize the Mn3+ to inhibit the Jahn–Teller effect in the preparation process. As a result, CMC‐MnO2 based ZIB can provide a specific capacity of 324 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, and achieve 86.2% retention after a long cycle test of 1000 cycles. Furthermore, the energy storage mechanism may be attributed to the insertion/extraction of H+/Zn2+, dissolution/deposition of MnO2 and Zn4SO4(OH)6·nH2O, and irreversible transformation of vermiculite during long cycles. This work may open new perspectives for the development of MnO2‐based cathodes in ZIBs.",

        "abstract": "As a promising alternative for lithium ion batteries, room-temperature sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have become one significant research frontier of energy storage devices although there are still many difficulties to be overcome. For the moment, the studies still concentrate on the preparation of new electrode materials for SIBs to meet the applicability. Herein, one new P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn5/9Al1/9O2 (NMA) cathode material is successfully prepared via a simple and facile liquid-state method. The prepared NMA is layered transition metal oxide, which can keep stable crystal structure during sodiation/desodiation as demonstrated by the ex situ X-ray diffraction, and its electrochemical properties can be further enhanced by connecting the cake-like NMA microparticles with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) using a ball milling method. Electrochemical tests show that the formed RGO-connected NMA (NMA/RGO) can deliver a higher reversible capacity of up to 138 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and also exhibit a superior high-rate capabilities and cycling stability in comparison to pure NMA. The much improved properties should be attributed to the reduced particle size and improvement of electrical conductivity and apparent Na(+) diffusion due to RGO incorporation, which is comprehensively verified by the electrochemical technologies of galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry at various scan rate as well as ex-situ X-ray diffraction studies.",

        "abstract": "Activating multielectron reactions of sodium superionic conductor (NASICON)-type cathodes toward higher energy density remains imperative to boost their application feasibility. However, multisodium storage with high stability is difficult to achieve due to the sluggish reaction kinetics, irreversible phase transitions, and negative structural degradation. Herein, a kind of NASICON-type Na2.5V1.5Ti0.5(PO4)3/C (NVTP-0.5) hierarchical microsphere consisting of abundant primary nanoparticles is designed, realizing a reversible 3.2-electron reaction with high stability. The optimized NVTP-0.5 cathode demonstrates an ultrahigh discharge capacity of 192.42 mAh g-1, energy density of up to 497.3 Wh kg-1 at 20 mA g-1, and capacity retention ratio of 94.1% after 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1. Additionally, the NVTP-0.5 cathode delivers excellent tolerance to extreme temperatures while also achieving a high-energy density of 400 Wh kg-1 (based on the cathode mass) in a full-cell configuration. Systematic in situ/ex situ analysis results confirm the multisodium storage processes of NVTP-0.5 involving successive redox reactions (V2+/V3+, Ti3+/Ti4+, and V3+/V4+ redox couples) and reversible structure evolution (solid-solution and biphasic mechanisms), which contribute to the high capacity and excellent cycling stability.

However, oxidation and reduction of lattice‐oxygen are always asymmetric, showing poor reversibility upon charging and discharging due to the activated oxygen loss and subsequent structural rearrangement. Here, a layered Na0.7[Li0.2Mn0.7Co0.1]O2 (NLMCO) is developed by balancing lattice‐oxygen activity and reversibility, which can deliver a record energy density of 729.7 Wh kg−1, further exceeding the state‐of‐the‐art Na0.75[Li0.25Mn0.75]O2 (NLMO, 638.4 Wh kg−1). In light of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, in situ differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy, and electrochemical testing results, the highly activated lattice‐oxygen is effectively stabilized in NLMCO without oxygen molecule release while obvious oxygen release is detected in the highly activated NLMO. Benefiting from the enhanced transition metal‐oxygen covalency and reduced band energy gap, the NLMCO electrode demonstrates simultaneously high lattice‐oxygen activity and reversibility, thus resulting in excellent rate and cycling performance, as well as ultra‐high energy density. The findings highlight the critical association of energy density and lattice‐oxygen redox reversibility, which will inspire more interest in anionic redox‐based high‐energy batteries.",

        "abstract": "Low-temperature synthesis of polyanionic cathodes for sodium-ion batteries is highly desirable but often plagued by prolonged reaction times and suboptimal crystallinity. To address these challenges, a novel self-adaptive coordination field regulation (SACFR) strategy based on a dynamic lock-and-release (DLR) mechanism is introduced. Specifically, urea is used as a DLR carrier during synthesis, which dynamically \"locks\" and \"releases\" vanadium ions for controlled release, simultaneously \"locking\" H+ ions to enhance phosphate group release, thereby creating a self-adaptive coordination field that can intelligently respond to real-time demands of the reaction system. This dynamic coordination behavior contributes to both an improvement in reaction kinetics and a significant reduction in Gibbs free energy change (ΔG). As a result, the kinetic efficiency and thermodynamic spontaneity of the reaction are greatly enhanced, enabling the efficient synthesis of high-crystalline Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) at 90 °C within just 3 hours. The as-prepared NVOPF cathode exhibits exceptional rate performance and ultra-stable cycling stability across a broad temperature range. Furthermore, the successful kilogram-scale synthesis underscores the practical potential of the innovative strategy. This work pioneers the regulation of coordination field chemistry for polyanionic cathode synthesis, providing transformative insights into material design.",

The Si−O and Mn−O bonds with prominent probability density peaks validated structural stability. Wide‐band gap of 2.35 (ϵ=0 %) and 2.54 eV (ϵ=−4 %), and narrow bandgap of 2.24 eV (ϵ=+4 %) estimated with stronger coupling of p–d σ bond than that of the p–d π bond, mainly contributed from the oxygen p‐state and manganese d‐state. Na+‐ion diffusivity was found to be enhanced by three orders of magnitude as the applied biaxial strain changed from compressive to tensile. According to the findings, the rational design of biaxial strain would improve the ionic and electronic conductivity of Na2MnSiO4 cathode materials for advanced rechargeable sodium‐ion batteries.",

With high ionic conductivity and excellent stability with Li, Ta‐doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZTO) is an effective option. However, the poor solid–solid interface contact induced by the lithiophobic Li2CO3 layer hinder its practical application. Herein, a versatile strategy is proposed based on the hydrolysis of sodium tetrafluoroborate (NaBF4), aiming to convert the Li2CO3 into multifunctional hybrid layer containing LiF, LiBO2, and NaF. Among them, LiF and LiBO2 serve as the primary Li ion conductors, the introduction of NaF with high surface energy not only enhances the interface wettability, but also further elevates the critical dendrite strength against Li dendrites. All three components serve as excellent electronic insulators, suppressing electron invasion at the interface and preventing Li dendrite growth in the solid electrolyte. As expected, the interfacial impedance of the NaBF4 treated symmetric cell is reduced to 6.0 Ω cm2, the critical current density (CCD) comes to 2.0 mA cm−2, and cycles over 3000 h at 0.3 mA cm−2 and 1500 h at 0.5 mA cm−2 respectively.

        "abstract": "The P2‐type layered transition metal oxide cathodes confront formidable challenges, including irreversible deleterious phase transitions, transition metals migration, and sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics, which hamper their rapid commercial application in sodium ion batteries (SIB). In this work, an entropy tuning with dual‐site substitution strategy is proposed to address the aforementioned issues. In the tailored [Na0.67Zn0.05]Ni0.22Cu0.06Mn0.66Ti0.01O2 (NZNCMTO) cathodes, the strategic incorporation of Zn ions serves to occupy Na sites, intentionally disrupting the Na/vacancy ordering and establishing a reinforcing “pillar” effect within the layered framework. Furthermore, the substitution of Cu and Ti for Ni and Mn bolsters covalent bonding with the lattice oxygen, thereby impeding the migration of the transition metal ions and leading to a near‐zero strain structural evolution during charge and discharge process. Density functional theory calculations confirmed that entropy‐tuned NZNCMTO substantially lowered the migration energy barrier for Na+ ions diffusion and improved electronic conductivity. Consequently, the NZNCMTO cathode exhibits an impressive high practical capacity of 91.54 mAh g−1 at a high discharge rate of 10 C, along with outstanding cycling stability, maintaining near 100% capacity retention over 500 cycles at a current density of 10 C.

A combined experimental and theoretical investigations on Na3V2P3–xBxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) are undertaken to reveal the evolution of crystal and electronic structures and Na storage properties associated with various concentration of B. X‐ray diffraction results indicate that the crystal structure of Na3V2P3–xBxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1/3) consisted of rhombohedral Na3V2(PO4)3 with tiny shrinkage of crystal lattice. X‐ray absorption spectra and the calculated crystal structures all suggest that the detailed local structural distortion of substituted materials originates from the slight reduction of V–O distances. Na3V2P3‐1/6B1/6O12 significantly enhances the structural stability and electrochemical performance, giving remarkable enhanced capacity of 100 and 70 mAh g−1 when the C‐rate increases to 5 C and 10 C.

The battery with the NCCNs-based cathode shows significant improvement on rate and cycle performance at 190 oC.

Furthermore, in-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals faster electron and ion transport process precisely on the charging and discharging processes of the NCCNs-based cathode. It is found that the NCCNs can not only play the role of a continuous conductivity network, but also limit the growth of grains.

Synchrotron operando X‐ray diffraction demonstrates that Te substitution can suppress the O3−P3−O1‐phase transition during charge and discharge processes effectively, benefited from the strong TeO covalent bonds. The resulted Na2.2Ni2Sb0.2Te0.8O6 cathode exhibits a high capacity retention of 70.9% after 1000 cycles at 1C, with an elevated operating voltage of ≈3.8 V. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduced TeO bonds break the symmetric distribution of charge in Ni/Sb honeycomb structure and elevate the operation voltage by increased valence band width. Proper Te substitution can promote the rate and cycle capability of the cathode by suppressing phase transition and decreasing the bandgap.",

        "abstract": "Na3 V2 (PO4 )2 O2 F (NVPOF) is widely accepted as advanced cathode material for sodium-ion batteries with high application prospects ascribing to its considerable specific capacity and high working voltage. However, challenges in the full realization of its theoretical potential lie in the novel structural design to accelerate its Na+ diffusivity. Herein, considering the important role of polyanion groups in constituting Na+ diffusion tunnels, boron (B) is doped at the P-site to obtain Na3 V2 (P2- x Bx O8 )O2 F (NVP2- x Bx OF). As evidenced by density functional theory modeling, B-doping induces a dramatic decrease in the bandgap. Delocalization of electrons on the O anions in BO4 tetrahedra is observed in NVP2- x Bx OF, which dramatically lowers the electrostatic resistance experienced by Na+ . As a result, the Na+ diffusivity in the NVP2- x Bx OF cathode has accelerated up to 11 times higher, which secures a high rate property (67.2 mAh g-1 at 60 C) and long cycle stability (95.9% capacity retention at 108.6 mAh g-1 at 10 C after 1000 cycles). The assembled NVP1.90 B0.10 OF//Se-C full cell demonstrates exceptional power/energy density (213.3 W kg-1 @ 426.4 Wh kg-1 and 17970 W kg-1 @ 119.8 Wh kg-1 ) and outstanding capability to withstand long cycles (90.1% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 105.3 mAh g-1 at 10 C).",

        "abstract": "The electrochemical performance of room‐temperature sodium‐sulfur batteries (SSBs) is limited by slow reaction kinetics and sulfur loss in the form of sodium polysulfides (SPSs). Here, it is demonstrated that through electron spin polarization, at no additional energy cost, an external magnetic field (M on) generated by a permanent magnet can significantly improve the SPSs adsorption capacity and reaction dynamics of a ferrimagnetic sulfur host. More specifically, the preparation of a carbon nanofiber/CoFe2O4/S (CNF/CoFe2O4/S) cathode with unprecedented performance and stability at ambient temperature is detailed when M on. It is experimentally and theoretically demonstrated that the magnetic field polarizes the electrons of Co ions, enhancing the adsorption of SPSs and their catalytic conversion. CNF/CoFe2O4/S cathodes with spin polarization provide unprecedented decay rates down to 0.0039% per cycle at 1.0 C for 2700 cycles. The performance of SSBs is further tested, which has 248 mAh g−1 under 1.0 C after 100 cycles when M on. Furthermore, it is evidenced that even when removing the external magnetic field, the magnetic polarization effect persists, opening the door for practical applications. This study not only demonstrates an effective strategy to improve electrochemical performance in SSBs, but also contributes to the enrichments of spin effects in the fields of electrocatalysis.",

However, their low capacity and high diffusion barrier remain unsolved problems. In this work, we systematically studied the theoretical capacity and sodium ion diffusion barrier in a new family of layered transition metal compounds, named MX2 (M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, and Fe; X = C, N, and O), as the cathode materials of SIBs. The results indicate that all 2H-phase MX2 materials possess a high theoretical capacity of over 300 mA h g−1. Moreover, it is found that the 2H-phase CrN2 exhibits a desirable sodium ion diffusion barrier, indicating high mobility of sodium ions. In addition, the layered CrN2 has a remarkable voltage window (3.1–3.8 V) and outstanding electrochemical performance arising from the charge transfer between Na and N atoms, which is induced by the large electronegativity of nitrogen. Our research provides a promising candidate for application in SIB cathode materials in the future.",

        "abstract": "Solid‐state sodium‐ion/metal batteries (SSSBs) are highly desirable for next‐generation energy storage systems, while very limited Na‐ion solid‐state electrolytes are explored. The borohydride‐based solid electrolytes are expected to achieve the high energy density target, due to their low redox potential, low Young's modulus as well as high stability toward alkali metals. However, the biggest challenge of borohydride‐based electrolyte is the low ionic conductivity. In this study, an anti‐perovskite solid‐state electrolyte (SSE) material rich in vacancy defects is explored, Na2BH4NH2, to solve above problems. Benefitting from rich vacancy defects, a high ionic conductivity of 7.56 × 10−4 S cm−1 with a low activation energy for Na+ migration of 0.67 eV at 90 °C are achieved. The NaSn|Na2BH4NH2|NaSn symmetric cell cycles at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2 for 500 h. Moreover, the universality of Na2BH4NH2 electrolyte is verified by TiS2 cathode, indicating that Na2BH4NH2 has good compatibility with electrode material. These outstanding performances suggest that it is a viable strategy to increase the ionic conductivity by forming vacancy defects, leading to the further development of solid electrolytes with superior properties.",

In particular, sulfide-based electrolytes, which show very high ionic conductivity and good malleability, exhibit degradation reactions at the interface with electrode materials and carbon additives. A new group of solid electrolytes, i.e., sodium halides, shows wider potential windows and better stability at typical cathode potentials. A detailed investigation of the interface reactions of Na3SbS4 and Na2.4Er0.4Zr0.6Cl6 as catholytes in cathodes and their cycling performance in full cells is performed. X-ray spectroscopy, time-of-flight spectrometry, and impedance spectroscopy are used to study the interface of each catholyte with a transition metal oxide cathode active material. In addition, impedance measurements were used to study the separator electrolyte Na3SbS4 with the catholyte Na2.4Er0.4Zr0.6Cl6.

        "abstract": "Sodium vanadate NaV6O15 (NVO) is one of the most promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries because of its low cost and high theoretical capacity. Nevertheless, NVO suffers from fast capacity fading and poor rate capability. Herein, a novel free-standing NVO/multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composite film cathode was synthesized and designed by a simple hydrothermal method followed by a dispersion technique with high safety and low cost. The kinetics analysis based on cyclic voltammetry measurements reveals that the intimate integration of the MWCNT 3D porous conductive network with the 3D pillaring tunnel structure of NVO nanorods enhances the Na+ intercalation pseudocapacitive behavior, thus leading to exceptional rate capability and long lifespan. Furthermore, the NVO/MWCNT composite exhibits excellent structural stability during the charge/discharge process. With these benefits, the composite delivers a high discharge capacity of 217.2 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 in a potential region of 1.5-4.0 V. It demonstrates a superior rate capability of 123.7 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1. More encouragingly, it displays long lifespan; impressively, 96% of the initial capacity is retained at 5 A g-1 for over 500 cycles.

Although surface reconstruction strategies are widely used to solve the above issues, the utilization of the low‐cost wet chemical method is extremely challenging for moisture‐sensitive Na‐based oxide materials. Here, the solvation tuning strategy is proposed to overcome the deterioration of NaNi1/3Mn1/3Fe1/3O2 in water‐based solution and conduct the surface reconstruction. When capturing the water molecules by the solvation structure of cations, here is Li+, the structural collapse and degradation of layered oxides in water‐based solvents are greatly mitigated. Furthermore, Li(H2O)3EA+ promotes the profitable Li+/Na+ exchange to build a robust surface, which hampers the decomposition of electrolytes and the structural evolution upon cycling. Accordingly, the lifespan of Li‐reinforced materials is prolonged to three times that of the pristine one. This work represents a step forward in understanding the surface reconstruction operated in a water‐based solution for high‐performance sodium layered oxide cathodes.",

We demonstrate that thermal dehydration leads to a significantly improved cycling stability of over 300 cycles at 15 mA g-1 with coulombic efficiency of >99.9%. In particular, the electrode with the lowest water content exhibited the fastest Na+-ion insertion/extraction as evidenced by the larger CV peak currents during successive scans compared to hydrated samples.

        "abstract": "Layered transition metal oxides are promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries due to their high energy density and appropriate operating potential. However, the poor structural stability is a major drawback to their widespread application. To address this issue, B3+ is successfully introduced into the tetrahedral site of Na0.67 Fe0.5 Mn0.5 O2 , demonstrating the effectiveness of small-radius ion doping in improving electrochemical performance. The obtained Na0.67 Fe0.5 Mn0.5 B0.04 O2 exhibits excellent cycling performance with 88.8% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1 C and prominent rate performance. The structure-property relationship is constructed subsequently by neutron powder diffraction, in situ X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, which reveal that the Jahn-Teller distortion and the consequent P2-P2' phase transformation are effectively mitigated because of the occupancy of B3+ at the interstitial site. Furthermore, it is found that the transition metal layers are stabilized and the transition metal dissolution are suppressed, resulting in excellent cycling performance. Besides, the prominent rate performance is attributed to the enhanced diffusion kinetics associated with the rearrangement of Na+ . This work provides novel insight into the action mechanism of interstitial site doping and demonstrates a universal approach to improve the electrochemical properties of P2-type manganese-based sodium cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "Manganese-based layered oxides are considered promising cathodes for sodium ion batteries due to their high capacity and low-cost manganese and sodium resources. Triggering the anionic redox reaction (ARR) can exceed the capacity limitation determined by conventional cationic redox. However, the unstable ARR charge compensation and Jahn-Teller distortion of Mn3+ ions readily result in structural degradation and rapid capacity fade. Here, we report a P2-type Na0.8Li0.2Mn0.7Cu0.1O2 cathode that shows a capacity retention of 84.5% at 200 mA/g after 200 cycles. Combining in situ X-ray diffraction and multi other ex situ characterizations, we reveal that the enhanced cycling stability is ascribed to a slow release of cationic redox activity which can well suppress the Jahn-Teller distortion and favor the ARR reversibility. Furthermore, density-functional theory calculations demonstrate that the inhibited interlayer migration and reduced band gap facilitate the stability and kinetic behavior of ARR. These findings provide a perspective for designing high-energy-density cathode materials with ARR activity.",

However, high water and vacancies content of PBAs lower their energy density and bring safety issues, impeding their large-scale application in SIBs. Herein, a facile \"potassium-ions assisted\" strategy is proposed to synthesize highly crystallized PBAs. By manipulating the dominant crystal plane and suppressing vacancies, the as-prepared PBAs exhibits increased redox potential resulting in high energy density up to ~450 Wh kg-1, which is at the same level of the well-known LiFePO4 cathodes for lithium-ion batteries. Remarkably, unconventional highly-reversible phase evolution and redox-active pairs were identified by multiple in-situ techniques for the first time. The preferred guest-ion storage sites and migration mechanism were systematically analysed through theoretical calculations. We believe these results could inspire the designing of safe SIBs with high energy density.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) are promising candidates for specific stationary applications considering their low-cost and cost-effective energetic property compared to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Additional cost cutbacks are achievable by employing natural materials as active cathode materials for NIBs. In this work, we report the use of natural pyrolusite (β-MnO2) as a precursor for the synthesis of a NaMnO blend (a mixture of layered P2-Na0.67Mn0.85Al0.15O2 without any doping technique combined with a post-spinel NaMn2O4 without any high-pressure synthesis). The synthesized powder was characterized by XRD, evidencing these two phases, along with two additional phases. Tests for Na-ion insertion registered a reversible discharge capacity of 104 mA h/g after 10 cycles with a well-defined plateau at 2.25 V. After 500 cycles at a C/4 current density, a high Coulombic efficiency between 96 and 99% was achieved, with an overall 25% capacity retention loss. These pilot tests are encouraging; they provide economic relief since the natural material is abundant (low-cost). Desirable, energetic assurances and ecological confirmations are obtainable if these materials are implemented in large-scale stationary applications. The synthesis technique does not use any toxic metals or toxic solvents and has limited side product formation.",

        "abstract": "Aqueous zinc ion battery (AZIB) has been widely investigated in recent years because of its advantages of green, safe and abundant raw materials. It is necessary to continue to study how to prepare cathode materials with excellent performance and high cycling stability toward future commercialization. In this work, we proposed a strategy that uses sodium lignosulfonate as both carbon and sodium source to obtain a sodium pre-intercalated vanadium oxide/carbon (VO/LSC) composite as the cathode of AZIB. The carbon matrix could improve the electronic conductivity of vanadium oxide, while the sodium lignosulfonate can provide sodium ions pre-intercalated into the layered vanadium oxide simultaneously. Through this strategy, we obtained a vanadium-based cathode materials with high stability and excellent rate capability. The VO/LSC cathode delivered high capacities of 350 and 112.8 mAh g -1 at 0.1 and 4.0 A g -1 resepectively. We selected zinc sulfate and zinc trifluoromethyl sulfonate as electrolytes respectively, and analyzed the influence of electrolytes on the performance of VO/LSC. What's more, we used the oxygen in the environment to oxidize the low-priced vanadium oxide to achieve a self-charging AZIB. This paper provide a valuable strategy for the design of vanadium-base cathode material for AZIB, which can broaden the research and application of AZIB.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal layered oxides (NaxTMO2), boasting a high theoretical specific capacity and affordability, have emerged as prominent cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Their potential, however, is hindered when operating at higher voltage range (4.0–4.3 V) due to irreversible phase transition, heterogeneous surface reconstruction, and side reaction. Herein, using a straightforward room‐temperature liquid‐phase reductive method, a dual conformal protective layer is in situ constructed on the surface of NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2(NFM). This layer comprises both a spinel structure and an amorphous CoxB coating, thereby achieving a layered‐spinel‐CoxB configuration. The spinel structure provides 3D Na+ transport channels and works as a pillar to anchor the intrinsic layered structure. Simultaneously, the external CoxB layer effectively mitigates O loss, transition metal ion dissolution, and undesired side reactions on the surface. Benefiting from the synergistic effects on both the material's bulk and surface, the 1wt% CoxB coated cathode displays superior stability. After 300 cycles, the capacity retention is 79.6% between 2 and 4 V, significantly outperforming pristine‐NFM's(p‐NFM) 51.4%. When charged to 4.3 V, its capacity retention stands at 70%, much higher than that of p‐NFM (51.2%). This work provides new insights into exploiting high‐voltage stable cathode through constructing a dual conformal protective layer for high energy density SIBs.",

However, the practical application of this material is limited by its poor cyclic stability and insufficient rate capability. Here, a strategy to substitute the Fe3+ in NaNi0.25Fe0.5Mn0.25O2 with Al3+ is adopted to address these issues. The substitution of Fe3+ with Al3+ enhances the framework stability and phase transition reversibility of the parent NaNi0.25Fe0.5Mn0.25O2 material by forming a stronger TM-O bond, which improves the cycling stability. Moreover, partial Al3+ substitution increases the interslab distance, providing a spacious path for Na+ diffusion and resulting in fast diffusion kinetics, which lead to improved rate capability. Consequently, the target NaNi0.25Fe0.5-xAlxMn0.25O2 sample with optimal x = 0.045 exhibits a remarkable electrochemical performance in a Na-ion cell with a large reversible capacity of 131.7 mA h g-1, a stable retention of approximately 81.6% after cycling at 1C for 100 cycles, and a rate performance of 81.3 mA h g-1 at 10C.

        "abstract": "In the development of practical sodium‐ion batteries, electrochemical performance and cost efficiency of the electrode materials are vital considerations. Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have emerged as promising cathode materials due to their affordability, high theoretical capacity, and cycling stability. However, low crystallinity can negatively impact their performance. This study introduces a straightforward “chelating agent‐assisted” method for producing highly crystalline PBAs. The resulting cathode boasts excellent characteristics, including a high capacity of 150 mAh g−1, an initial Coulombic efficiency of 87.2 %, a long cycling lifespan of 1000 cycles, and superior rate performance. Furthermore, the study shows that the low structure distortion and high sodium diffusion coefficient can be attributed to the suppression of structural defects, as evidenced by in situ synchrotron powder diffraction. We believe these findings have the potential to enable the widespread use of PBAs in sodium‐ion batteries for an affordable and large‐scale energy storage system.",

        "abstract": "Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) with stable framework structures are ideal cathodes for rechargeable Na-ion batteries (SIBs). The chelating-agent-assisted co-precipitate method is an effective way to obtain low-defect PBAs that can limit the appearance of too many vacancies and water molecules and achieve an optimized Na-storage performance. However, for this method, the mechanism of chelating-agent-assisted synthesis is still unclear. Herein, the synthesis process of nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) has been investigated by in-situ infrared spectroscopy detection, with the results showing that the chelating agent oxalate makes the nucleation process slows down and effectively inhibits the formation of the Fe-C≡N-Ni frame in the aging process, producing highly-crystallized and low-defect NiHCF samples. The high-quality NiHCF presents high specific capacity as 86.3 mAh g-1 (the theoretical value ~85 mAh g-1), an ultra-stable cyclic retention of 90% over 800 cycles, and a remarkable high capacity retention as 74.6% at a current density of 4250 mA g-1 (50 C).

        "abstract": "Enhancing the energy density of layered oxide cathode materials is of great significance for realizing high-performance sodium-ion batteries and promoting their commercial application. Lattice oxygen redox at high voltage usually enables a high capacity and energy density. But the structural degradation, severe voltage decay, and the resultant poor cycling performance caused by irreversible oxygen release seriously restrict the practical application. Herein we introduce a novel fence-type superstructure (2a × 3a type supercell) into O3-type layered cathode material Na0.9Li0.1Ni0.3Mn0.3Ti0.3O2 and achieve a stable cycling performance at a high voltage of 4.4 V. The fence-type superstructure effectively inhibits the formation of the vacancy clusters resulting from out-of-plane Li migration and in-plane transition metal migration at high voltage due to the wide d-spacing, thereby significantly reducing the irreversible release of lattice oxygen and greatly stabilizing the crystal structure. The cathode exhibits a high energy density of 545 Wh kg-1, a high rate capability (112.8 mAh g-1 at 5C) and a high cycling stability (85.8%@200 cycles with a high initial capacity of 148.6 mAh g-1 at 1C) accompanied by negligible voltage attenuation (98.5%@200 cycles). This strategy provides a distinct spacing effect of superstructure to design stable high-voltage layered cathode materials for Na-ion batteries.",

Its unique oriented stacking nanosheet constructed hierarchical book-like structure is the origin of the high electrochemical performance, which is able to shorten the diffusion distances of Na+ and electrons, and a certain gap between the nanosheets can also relieve the stress and strain of volume generated during the cycle.

It is reported that utilizing both cationic and anionic redox reactions is a promising method for higher energy density cathodes.

The Ni3+/Ni4+ redox couple and the anionic redox reaction are proven to have a competitive relationship.

In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements and galvanostatic charging/discharging derived dV/dQ, representing resistance changes with time, are obtained to reveal the mechanism of the anionic redox reaction.

More importantly, their capacity degradation mechanism remains to be established. In this paper, we introduce an O3-type Ni-rich AlF3-coated nanorod gradient Na[Ni0.65Co0.08Mn0.27]O2 cathode with enhanced electrochemical performance in both half-cells and full cells. AlF3-coated nanorod gradient Na[Ni0.65Co0.08Mn0.27]O2 particles were synthesized through a combination of dry ball-mill coating and columnar composition gradient design and deliver a discharge capacity of 168 mAh g-1 with 90% capacity retention in half cells (50 cycles) and 132 mAh g-1 with 90% capacity retention in full cells (200 cycles) at 75 mA g-1 (0.5C, 1.5-4.1 V).

        "abstract": "Li-ion capacitors (LICs) are emerging as complementary energy storage devices to Li-ion batteries to satisfy some specific applications where high power density and long cycle life are required. Due to the wide usage of LICs, LICs with promising energy density are urgently needed; however, at this stage, the achievement of this type of LICs is the main challenge. In this study, we increased the energy density of LICs via both material optimization and charge storage mechanism exploration. Moreover, porous carbon with a high surface area of over 2800 m2 g-1 was fabricated from alkali lignin via a traditional KOH activation method assisted by self-activation. A wide voltage window of 1.0-4.8 V was applied where the synergistic storage of anions and cations was achieved. This shows that a deep discharge down to 1.0 V is necessary for the complete desorption of anions, which also triggers the adsorption of cations (Li+), resulting in increased capacity. However, a compromise must be made in the energy efficiency due to intensified battery polarization upon deep discharging. Furthermore, considering the natural abundance of sodium and potassium over lithium, Na- and K-ion capacitors have been investigated for sustainable development using the as-prepared carbon materials.",

Na2Mn3O7 [Na4/7[Mn6/7□1/7]O2, □ for the transition metal (TM) vacancies] with native and ordered TM vacancies can conduct a reversible oxygen redox and be a promising high-energy cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, its phase transition at low potentials (∼1.5 V vs Na+/Na) induces potential decays. Herein, magnesium (Mg) is doped on the TM vacancies to form a disordered Mn/Mg/□ arrangement in the TM layer. The Mg substitution suppresses the oxygen oxidation at ∼4.2 V by reducing the number of the Na-O-□ configurations. Meanwhile, this flexible disordering structure inhibits the generation of the dissolvable Mn2+ ions and mitigates the phase transition at ∼1.6 V. Therefore, the Mg doping improves the structural stability and its cycling performance in 1.5-4.5 V. The disordering arrangement endows Na0.49Mn0.86Mg0.06□0.08O2 with a higher Na+ diffusivity and improved rate performance.

Herein, a doping-integrated coating strategy based on zinc element is proposed to modify P2-type Na0.66Ni0.33Mn0.67O2, which can be achieved by a facile one-step solid-state reaction. The formation mechanism of Na0.66Ni0.26Zn0.07Mn0.67O2@0.06ZnO (NNZM@0.06ZnO) is investigated, revealing that the spinel and P3 intermediate phases appear prior to the formation of the P2 phase. Ni2+ can be preferentially incorporated into the P2 structure in competition with Zn2+ at high temperature, resulting in a uniform enrichment of ZnO on the surface. A small amount of Zn2+ doping significantly suppresses the Na+/vacancy ordering effect and improves the structural reversibility. Furthermore, the electrolyte decomposition is effectively reduced because of the presence of the ZnO coating layer, leading to the formation of a thin cathode electrolyte interphase film that is favorable to fast Na+ diffusion. In virtue of the Zn2+ doping and in situ formed ZnO coating, NNZM@0.06ZnO exhibits excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 83.7% after 100 cycles at 100 mA g-1 and rate performance with a discharge capacity of 56.4 mAh g-1 at 2000 mA g-1, which significantly outperforms the uncoated Na0.66Ni0.26Zn0.07Mn0.67O2 and the Na0.66Ni0.26Zn0.07Mn0.67O2/0.06ZnO with the coating layer introduced by mechanical milling.

Nondestructive analysis was made through the electrode/electrolyte interface of the first electrochemical cycle to ensure access to information not only on the active material, but also on the passivation layer formed at the electrode surface and referred to as the solid permeable interface (SPI). This investigation clearly shows the role of the SPI and the complexity of the redox reactions. Cobalt, nickel, and manganese are all electrochemically active upon cycling between 4.5 and 2.0 V; all are in the 4+ state at the end of charging. Reduction to Co(3+), Ni(3+), and Mn(3+) occurs upon discharging and, at low potential, there is partial reversible reduction to Co(2+) and Ni(2+). A thin layer of Na2 CO3 and NaF covers the pristine electrode and reversible dissolution/reformation of these compounds is observed during the first cycle. The salt degradation products in the SPI show a dependence on potential. Phosphates mainly form at the end of the charging cycle (4.5 V), whereas fluorophosphates are produced at the end of discharging (2.0 V).",

The feasibility of the experiment is also confirmed by theoretical analysis. Benefiting from stable crystal structure and the removal of interstitial water, the as-prepared Na2NixMnyFe(CN)6 sample exhibits a high reversible capacity of 150 mA h g-1. In addition, a high rate performance of 77 mA h g-1 is achieved at a current density of 1600 mA g-1. Most noteworthy, the Coulombic efficiency and specific capacity gradually increase in the first few cycles, which can be ascribed to the formation of a passivation layer on the surface of the electrode.

        "abstract": "Sodium ion technology is increasingly investigated as a low-cost solution for grid storage applications. Among the reported cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries, Na3V2(PO4)2FO2 is considered as one of the most promising materials due to its high operation voltage and good cyclability. Here, the de-sodiumization process of Na3V2(PO4)2FO2 has been systematically examined using first-principles calculations to uncover the fundamental questions at the atomic level. Four stable intermediate products during the de-sodiumization process are firstly determined based on the convex hull, and three voltage platforms are then predicted. Except for two voltage platforms (3.37 V and 3.75 V) close to the experimental values, the platform up to 5.28 V exceeds the stability window (4.8 V) of a typical electrolyte, which was not observed experimentally. Excitingly, the change of volume is only 2% during the sodiumization process, which should be the reason for the good cycling stability of this material. Electronic structure analysis also reveals that the valence states of V ions will be changed from V5+ to V4+ during the sodiumization process, resulting in a weak Jahn-Teller distortion in VO5F octahedra, and then making the lattice-constants asymmetrically change. More seriously, combined with a bandgap of 2.0 eV, the conduction band minimum mainly composed of V-t2g non-bonding orbitals has strong localized characteristics, which should be the intrinsic origin of poor electron transport properties for NaxV2(PO4)2FO2. Nonetheless, benefiting from the layer-like structure features with F-segmentation, this material has an ultrafast sodium ionic conductivity comparable to that of NASICON, with an activation energy of only 82 meV. Therefore, our results indicate that maintaining layer-like features and regulating V atoms will be important directions to improve the performance of NaxV2(PO4)2FO2.",

        "abstract": "The development of high-rate cathodes particularly with remarkable wide-temperature-tolerance sodium-storage capability plays a significant role in commercial applications of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we devise a scaled-up electrospinning avenue to fabricate nanocrystal-constructed ultralong layered NaCrO2 nanowires (NWs) toward SIBs as a wide-temperature-operating cathode. The resultant one-dimensional (1D) NaCrO2 nanoarchitecture is endowed with orientated and shortened electronic/ionic transport and remarkable structural tolerance to stress change over sodiation-desodiation processes. Benefiting from these structural superiorities, the NaCrO2 NWs are featured with prominent Na+-storage behaviors in the wide-operating-temperature range from -15 to 55 °C. Promisingly, the NaCrO2 NWs exhibit extraordinary high-rate capacities of ∼108.8 and ∼87.2 mAh g-1 at 10 and 50 C rates at 25 °C, and even 94.6 (55 °C) and ∼60.1 (-15 °C) mAh g-1 at 10 C, along with outstanding cyclic stabilities with capacity retentions of ∼80.6% (-15 °C), 88.4% (25 °C), and ∼86.9% (55 °C). The overall performance of our NaCrO2 is superior to other reported NaCrO2-based cathodes, even with conductive nanocarbon coating. Encouragingly, a competitive energy density of ∼161 Wh kg-1 can be obtained by the NaCrO2 NWs-based full cell. Therefore, our NaCrO2 NWs can be highly anticipated as advanced cathode for commercial wide-temperature-tolerance SIBs.",

Upon insertion of sodium into the array of parallel ladders of V2O5, it was confirmed that lattice parameter of c is increased by 9.09%, corresponding to the increase in the unit-cell volume of 9.2%.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) as a promising technology for large-scale energy storage have received unprecedented attention. However, the cathodes in SIBs generally suffer from detrimental cathode-electrolyte interfacial side reactions and structural degradation during cycling, which leads to severe capacity fade and voltage decay. Here, we have developed an ultra-stable Na0.72Ni0.20Co0.21Mn0.55Mg0.036O2 (NCM-CS-GMg) cathode material in which a Mg-free core is encapsulated by a shell with gradient distribution of Mg using coprecipitation method with Mg-hysteretic cascade feedstock followed by calcination. From the interior to outer surface of the shell, as the content of electrochemically inactive Mg gradually increases, the Na+ deintercalation amount gradually decreases after charged. Benefiting from this surface gradient desodiation, the surface transition metal (TM) ion migration from TM layers to Na layers is effectively inhibited, thus suppressing the layered-to-rock-salt phase transition and the resultant microcracks. Besides, the less formation of high-valence TM ions on the surface contributes to a stable cathode-electrolyte interface. The as-prepared NCM-CS-GMg exhibits remarkable cycling life over 3000 cycles with a negligible voltage drop (0.127 mV per cycle). Our findings highlight an effective way to developing sustainable cathode materials without compromising on the initial specific capacity for SIBs.",

Herein, the electrochemical behavior of three organosulfur compounds, i.e., 4,4′‐thiobisbenzenethiol (TBBT), 1,4‐benzenedithiol (1,4‐BDT), and diphenyl disulfide (DPDS), is revealed in room‐temperature rechargeable sodium (Na) batteries, which show significantly improved performances when sodiated Nafion membranes are used. Large oligomers of organosulfur can be formed during charging, and they are readily blocked by the nanosized ion‐conducting clusters in the Nafion membrane. In addition, large organosulfur monomers can also be blocked. Only 5.4% of TBBT diffuses through the Nafion membrane after 800 h. The Na|TBBT cell sustains 77% of the theoretical capacity after 300 cycles (2420 h). Moreover, the Na|TBBT redox flow cell shows promising rechargeability.

        "abstract": "Room‐temperature sodium–sulfur batteries are potential candidate for sustainable large‐scale energy storage systems due to their high energy density and low cost. However, the shuttling effect of high‐order polysulfides (Na2Sn, 4 < n ≤ 8) usually leads to rapid capacity fading, while the reaction kinetics of low‐order polysulfides (Na2Sn, 1 ≤ n ≤ 4) are slow. In this work, microporous‐mesoporous carbon derived from mangosteen peels is reported as cathode materials for RT Na–S batteries. The designed micro‐mesoporous structure not only effectively suppresses the shuttling effect of sodium polysulfides (NaPS), but also has high electrical conductivity and porosity, which facilitates electron/ion diffusion. Oxygen functional groups on the surface provide high catalytic activity for efficient low‐order NaPS conversion. The obtained Na–S battery exhibits high reversible capacity with excellent long‐term cycle performance (526.1 mAh g−1 at 4 A g−1 after 1000 cycles) and outstanding rate performance (676.59 mAh g−1 at 16 A g−1).

By means of synchrotron X-ray diffraction, we reveal a layered structure consisting of pentaborate B5O10 groups connected through M2+ in tetrahedral coordination, providing possible three-dimensional Na-ion migration pathways. Inspired by these structural features, we examined the electrochemical performances versus sodium and showed that Na3FeB5O10 is active at an average potential of 2.5 V vs Na+/Na0, correlated to the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple as deduced from ex situ Mössbauer measurements. This contrasts with the case for Na3CoB5O10, which is electrochemically inactive.

        "abstract": "O'3-Na3Ni2SbO6 with a honeycomb cation order, as a potential cathode, presents simplified phase-transition steps and a high average voltage. To mitigate the intrinsic phase irreversibility, Mg, Zn, and Co have been introduced to displace part of the Ni, which inevitably reduces the theoretical capacity related to the Ni2+/Ni3+ redox reaction. In this work, an unusual dual-site substitution is carried out to increase the P'3-O'3 structure reversibility without sacrificing the practical capacity. In addition, it is found that special stacking faults along the c-axis direction can be induced by doping to result in incomplete Sb/Ni disorder, though the honeycomb order remains in every TM (transition-metal) layer. The codoped Na2.85Cs0.15Ni1.9Mg0.1SbO6 has a high degree of disorder, which breaks the ideal monoclinic symmetry (C2/m) and partly upgrades its structure to higher-symmetry models. Profiting from the influence of stacking disorder and doping ions on the coordination environment around Na, more gradual and smaller variations of the lattice parameters appear upon Na-ion extraction/insertion. Consequently, this cathode displays a high initial discharge capacity (120 mAh g-1), long-term cycling stability, and excellent rate performance (66 mAh g-1 under 10 C). These findings reveal that not only a full TM-disordered arrangement but also this incomplete stacking disorder can effectively improve the performance of a layered cathode.",

Ex situ X-ray diffraction demonstrates a single-phase reaction mechanism, and the density functional theory calculations display two one-dimensional sodium migration paths with low energy barriers in Na3.12Mn2.44(P2O7)2, which is vital for the facile sodium storage. We believe that this compound will be a competitive cathode material for large-scale SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Safety hazards caused by flammable electrolytes have been major obstacles to the practical application of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The adoption of nonflammable all-phosphate electrolytes can effectively improve the safety of SIBs; however, traditional low-concentration phosphate electrolytes are not compatible with carbon-based anodes. Herein, we report an anion-cation interaction modulation strategy to design low-concentration phosphate electrolytes with superior physicochemical properties. Tris(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) phosphate (TFEP) is introduced as a cosolvent to regulate the ion-solvent-coordinated (ISC) structure through enhancing the anion-cation interactions, forming the stable anion-induced ISC (AI-ISC) structure, even at a low salt concentration (1.22 M). Through spectroscopy analyses and theoretical calculations, we reveal the underlying mechanism responsible for the stabilization of these electrolytes. Impressively, both the hard carbon (HC) anode and Na4Fe2.91(PO4)2(P2O7) (NFPP) cathode work well with the developed electrolytes. The designed phosphate electrolyte enables Ah-level HC//NFPP pouch cells with an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of over 99.9% and a capacity retention of 84.5% after 2000 cycles. In addition, the pouch cells can operate in a wide temperature range (-20 to 60 °C) and successfully pass rigorous safety testing. This work provides new insight into the design of the electrochemically compatibility electrolyte for high-safety and long-lifetime SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Fierce phase transformation and limited sodium ion diffusion dynamics are critical obstacles that hinder the practical energy storage applications of P2-type layered sodium transition metal oxides (NaxTMO2). Herein, a synergistic strategy of electronic state tailoring and pillar effect was carefully implemented by substituting divalent Mg2+ into Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 material with unique oriented hollow rodlike structures. Mg2+substitution can not only facilitate the anionic oxygen redox reactions and electronic conductivity through increasing the electronic states at Femi energy but also act as pillars within TMO2 layers to alleviate the severe phase transformation to improve structure stability. Moreover, the oriented hollow structure incorporating sufficient buffer spaces and rationally exposed electrochemically active facets effectively alleviates the stresses induced by low volume changes of 8% and provides more open channels for Na+ ion diffusion without crossing multiple grain boundaries. Hence, the Na0.67Mg0.08Ni0.25Mn0.67O2 cathode showed a superior rate capability with high energy density and cycling stability for sodium-ion storage. The underlying mechanisms of these achievements were deciphered through diversified dynamic analysis and the first principle calculations, providing new insights into P2-type NaxTMO2 cathodes for the infinite prospect as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Rapid capacity fading and structural collapse, along with other deep‐rooted challenges in the high‐voltage region, are insufficient to meet the requirements for commercial applications of O3‐type layered cathodes. Hereby, rare earth metal (RE) within the IIIB group are utilized as the robust dopants for O3‐NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) to achieve the purpose of reconstructing the crystal lattice and regulating the interlayer structure. The inactive RE3+ acts as a pillar, reinforces the TMO6 octahedron, and broadens the Na+ diffusion layer in the configuration of O‐Na‐O‐TM (RE)‐O‐Na‐O, giving rise to the enhanced crystal stability and accelerating the transmission of sodium ions. More impressively, the scandium incorporation is working as a “vitamin” that improves Ni/Fe redox reversibility, alleviating the irreversible P3‐O3’‐P3’ phase transformation and further restraining the disordered Fe migration into the neighboring Na layer, which is firmly validated by in situ X‐ray diffraction coupled with the synchrotron X‐ray absorption spectroscopy. Consequently, the as‐designed NFM‐Sc exhibits impressive rate capability (82.5 mAh g−1 at 10 C) and excellent cycle stability with 80.2% capacity retention after 500 cycles at the high voltage of 4.2 V. Given this, the elaborate work may shed new insight into the operational mechanism of rare metal through strategically regulating the structure for sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The Mn-based polyanion compound Na3MnTi(PO4)3 (NMTP) with a Na superionic conductor (NASICON) structure has attracted incremental attention as a potential cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. However, the occupation of Mn2+ on Na+ vacancies usually leads to severe voltage hysteresis, which in turn results in significant capacity loss, slow Na+ diffusion kinetics, and poor cycling stability. Herein, anion-substituted compounds Na3MnTi(PO4)3-x(SiO4)x (x = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) are synthesized. It reveals that the SiO44- substitution could induce partial oxidation of Mn2+ to Mn3+, and the latter has a lower occupancy preference on Na+ vacancies. By the proposed charge compensation strategy, the Mn2+ occupation on Na+ vacancies can be significantly suppressed. As a result, the voltage hysteresis is substantially inhibited, and greatly improved electrochemical performance is achieved. This study offers an alternative strategy to address the voltage hysteresis associated with NMTP and other Mn-based NASICON cathode materials.",

Herein, a solid-solution strategy is proposed to partition Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 into 2NaFePO4·Na2FeP2O7 from the angle of molecular composition. Via regulating the starting ratio of NaFePO4 and Na2FeP2O7 during the synthesis process, the nonstoichiometric pure-phase material could be successfully synthesized within a narrow NaFePO4 content between 1.6 and 1.2.

        "abstract": "How to tune the activity and reversibility of oxygen anion redox (OAR) is a critical issue for O3‐type sodium‐ion battery (SIB) cathodes. Herein, the key role of electronegativity‐difference configuration on the activation of OAR is find out, and further tune electronegativity‐difference configuration with La incorporation to construct non‐bonded O 2p orbitals and achieve the reversible anionic redox in O3‐type NaMn1/3Fe1/3Ni1/3O2. Owing to the special extranuclear electronic structure of La3+ [Xe], the La electron cloud is difficult to be disturbed by the O electron cloud, and some O electrons do not participate in the formation of ionic bonds, thus retaining the non‐bonded electrons of O 2p and activating OAR. Moreover, La3+ doping also decreases the Coulomb force between Na+ and O2− favoring Na+ migration as well as strengthening the La─O bonds inhibiting the irreversible phase transition. La2O3 coating layer also plays a role on inhibiting the reaction between molecular oxygen and the electrolyte, and making OAR reversible. After modification, the cycling stability is significantly improved (86.9% vs 27.3%@2C@200cycles; 90.8% vs 52.9%@5C@300 cycles).

However the NaxMn[Fe(CN)6]y prepared by simple co-precipitation of Mn2+ and [Fe(CN)6]4- usually show poor cycling performance which hinder their practical application. In this work, electrochemical performance of a Na1.6Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.9 (PBM) sample prepared by simple precipitation method was greatly improved by coating with Na3(VOPO4)2F (NVOPF) via a solution precipitation method. The as-prepared PBM@NVOPF with a coating quantity of 2.0 % molar ratio showed enhanced rate capability and superior cyclic stability. The discharge capacities of PBM@NVOPF were 101.5 mAh g-1 (1C) and 91.4 mAh g-1 (10C), with capacity retention of 84.3% after 500 cycles at 1C, 20 °C. It also exhibited excellent cyclic stability at elevated temperature with initial capacity of 109.5 mAh g-1 and capacity retention of 78.8% after 200 cycles at 1C, 55 °C. In comparison, uncoated PBM showed discharge capacity of 105.7 mAh g-1 (1C) and 76.7 mAh g-1 (10C), with capacity retention of only 42.0% after 500 cycles at 1C, 20 °C. The high temperature performance of bare PBM was very poor the capacity retention was only 35.7% after 40 cycles due to serious Mn/Fe dissolution which caused structural deterioration of PBM. NVOPF coating protected the PBM from suffering corrosion in the electrolyte thus ensured the framework stability of PBM during long term cycling and contributed to the excellent electrochemical performance.",

However, their rate capability and durability are limited by tortuous Na+ diffusion channels and complicated phase evolution during Na+ extraction/insertion. Here we report our findings in unravelling the mechanism for dramatically enhancing the stability and rate capability of O3-NaNi0.5Mn0.5-xSbxO2 (NaNMS) by substitutional Sb doping, which can alter the coordination environment and chemical bonds of the transition metal (TM) ions in the structure, resulting in a more stable structure with wider Na+ transport channels. Furthermore, NaNMS nanoparticles are obtained by surface energy regulation during grain growth. The synergistic effect of Sb doping and nanostructuring greatly reduces the ionic migration energy barrier while increasing the reversibility of the structural evolution during repeated Na+ extraction/insertion. An optimized NaNMS-1 electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 212.3 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C and 74.5 mAh g-1 at 50 C with minimal capacity loss after 100 cycles at a low temperature of -20 °C.

Additionally, NVFP‐HE can also retain 66.7% of initial capacity after 10 000 charge–discharge cycles at 50C.

        "abstract": "As global energy storage demand increases, sodium‐ion batteries are often considered as an alternative to lithium‐ion batteries. Hexacyanoferrate cathodes, commonly referred to as Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), are of particular interest due their low‐cost synthesis and promising electrochemical response. However, because they consist of ~50 wt% cyanide anions, a possible release of highly toxic cyanide gases poses a significant safety risk. Previously, we observed the evolution of (CN)2 during cycling via differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), but were unable to determine a root cause or mechanism. In this work, we present a systematical investigation of the gas evolution of Prussian white (PW) with different water content via DEMS. While H2 is the main gas detected, especially in hydrated PW and during overcharge (4.6 V vs. Na+/Na), the evolution of CO2 and (CN)2 depends on the electrolyte conductive salt. The use of oxidative NaClO4 instead of NaPF6 is the leading cause for the formation of (CN)2. Mass spectrometric evidence of trace amounts of HCN is also found, but to a much lower extent than (CN)2, which is the dominant safety risk when using NaClO4‐containing electrolyte. Despite being a good model salt, it is not a viable option for commercial applications.",

        "abstract": "The practical application of Li-S batteries, which hold great potential as energy storage devices, is impeded by various challenges, such as capacity degradation caused volume change, polysulfide shuttling, poor electrode kinetics, and safety concerns. Binder plays a crucial role in suppressing volume change of cathode side, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries. In this research, a novel network binder (SA-Co-PEDOT) composed of sodium alginate is presented, Co2+ ions as cross-linking agent and PEDOT as an electronic conductor. The theoretical analysis and experimental testing confirm that the SA-Co-PEDOT binder with synergistic combination of catalytic center and electron transfer network effectively mitigates large volumetric changes during cycling while simultaneously enhancing electrode kinetics through controlling the deposition morphology of sulfur end product and its nucleation and dissolution. As a result, it achieves a capacity of 844 mAh g-1 after 150 cycles at 0.2 C. Moreover, the electrode with SA-Co-PEDOT binder subjected a bending test maintains a capacity of 395 mAh g-1 after 500 cycles at 0.5 C, exhibiting an impressively low decay rate of only 0.11%. Even with an ultra-low content of 2 wt.% SA-Co-PEDOT binder, the electrode still maintains a capacity of 999.7 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.5 C.",

Nevertheless, the inevitable interface problems like sluggish interfacial electrochemical reaction kinetics and poor interfacial ion storage capacity seriously hinder its application. Construction of chemical bonding is a highly effective way to solve interface problems. Herein, NVPOF with interfacial V-F-C bonding (CB-NVPOF) is developed. The CB-NVPOF cathode exhibits high rate capability (65 mA h g-1 at 40C) and long-term cycling stability (a capacity retention of 77% after 2000 cycles at 20C). Furthermore, it shows impressive electrochemical performance at temperatures as low as -40 °C, delivering a capacity of 56 mA h g-1 at 10C and a capacity retention of ∼80% after 500 cycles at 2C. The interfacial V-F-C bond engineering significantly advances the electronic conductivity, Na+ diffusion, as well as interface compatibility at -40 °C.

        "abstract": "An anionic redox reaction is an extraordinary method for obtaining high-energy-density cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The commonly used inactive-element-doped strategies can effectively trigger the O redox activity in several layered cathode materials. However, the anionic redox reaction process is usually accompanied by unfavorable structural changes, large voltage hysteresis, and irreversible O2 loss, which hinders its practical application to a large extent. In the present work, we take the doping of Li elements into Mn-based oxide as an example and reveal the local charge trap around the Li dopant will severely impede O charge transfer upon cycling. To overcome this obstacle, additional Zn2+ codoping is introduced into the system. Theoretical and experimental studies show that Zn2+ doping can effectively release the charge around Li+ and homogeneously distribute it on Mn and O atoms, thus reducing the overoxidation of O and improving the stability of the structure. Furthermore, this change in the microstructure makes the phase transition more reversible. This study aimed to provide a theoretical framework for further improve the electrochemical performance of similar anionic redox systems and provide insights into the activation mechanism of the anionic redox reaction.",

        "abstract": "Ni/Mn-based oxide cathode materials have drawn great attention due to their high discharge voltage and large capacity, but structural instability at high potential causes rapid capacity decay. How to moderate the capacity loss while maintaining the advantages of high discharge voltage remains challenging. Herein, the replacement of Mn ions by Ga ions is proposed in the P2-Na2/3 Ni0.2 Mn0.8 O2 cathode for improving their cycling performances without sacrificing the high discharge voltage. With the introduction of Ga ions, the relative movement between the transition metal ions is restricted and more Na ions are retained in the lattice at high voltage, leading to an enhanced redox activity of Ni ions, validated by ex situ synchrotron X-ray absorption spectrum and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Additionally, the P2-O2 phase transition is replaced by a P2-OP4 phase transition with a smaller volume change, reducing the lattice strain in the c-axis direction, as detected by operando/ex situ X-ray diffraction. Consequently, the Na2/3 Ni0.21 Mn0.74 Ga0.05 O2 electrode exhibits a high discharge voltage close to that of the undoped materials, while increasing voltage retention from 79% to 93% after 50 cycles.

        "abstract": "With the increasing demand for clean energy sources, the need for large-scale energy storage systems to ensure the stable output of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, has also increased. Sodium-ion batteries have emerged as a potential solution for these storage systems owing to their high energy density, abundance in the Earth's crust, and low cost. However, the larger atomic radius of sodium ions results in higher energy barriers for ion migration in cathode materials, which can affect the cycle life and rate performance of the battery. Therefore, developing a suitable structure that facilitates rapid sodiation and desodiation and maintains good cycling stability remains a significant challenge. This study aimed to reduce the content of trivalent manganese ions and minimize the impact of the Jahn-Teller effect to enhance the capacity retention of manganese-based layered oxides. Additionally, a series of P2-type Na0.78Li0.1ZnxNi0.15-xMn0.75O2 compounds were successfully synthesized through doping with divalent zinc ions. Structural analyses of the doped material indicated that Zn doping did not alter the crystal structure but increased the interlayer distance of the transition metals. Electrochemical performance tests revealed that appropriate Zn2+ doping promoted sodium-ion diffusion and improved the reversible capacity of the battery. This study provides a promising approach for developing sodium-ion batteries with rapid charging and discharging capabilities.",

Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) show a lot of promise to provide the required stationary storage at the grid level at low cost owing to the natural abundance and geographical availability of sodium. In addition, alkali-rich cathode materials exhibiting anionic redox contributions have garnered much attention over the past decade as a strategy to increase the specific capacity. In this work, we investigate for the first time the sodium-rich compound Na5FeO4 as a potential low-cost, environment-friendly cathode for sodium ion batteries from first principles using density functional theory. We investigate three low-energy polymorphs related to the antifluorite structure, verify their dynamical and mechanical stabilities, and show that they exhibit promising ion diffusive properties. As alkali-rich cathode materials are prone to oxygen loss during cycling, we investigate cycling stability with respect to phase transformations and oxygen loss and identify in particular one promising cycling interval that can reversibly shuttle 1.5 Na+ per formula unit between Na5FeO4 and Na3.5FeO4 with a gravimetric energy density exceeding 360 W h kg−1. Investigations into possible redox mechanisms reveal that the charge compensation occurs simultaneously on Fe- and O-atoms in FeO4-tetrahedra, which suggests that Na5FeO4, if realised experimentally as a cathode material, would join the family of combined cationic/anionic redox compounds.",

        "abstract": "Manganese-rich layered oxide materials hold great potential as low-cost and high-capacity cathodes for Na-ion batteries. However, they usually form P2 phase and suffer from fast capacity fade. In this work, an O3 phase sodium cathode has been developed out of a Li and Mn-rich layered material by leveraging the creation of transition metal (TM) and oxygen vacancies and the electrochemical exchange of Na and Li. The Mn-rich layered cathode material remains primarily O3 phase during sodiation/desodiation and can have a full sodiation capacity of ~220 mAh/g. It delivers ~160 mAh/g specific capacity between 2-3.8V with >86% retention over 250 cycles. Systematic characterizations and computational studies revealed that the TM and oxygen vacancies pre-formed in the sodiated material enables a \"reversible\" migration of TMs from the TM layer to the tetrahedral sites in the Na layer upon de-sodiation and sodiation. The migration creates metastable states, leading to increased kinetic barrier that prohibits a complete O3-P3 phase transition, hence stabilizing the structure and battery performance. This work provides a critical insight on the role of vacancies in TM migration and stabilization of phase transition, and sheds light on the future development of high performance and stable cathode materials for Na-ion batteries and beyond.",

        "abstract": "Though considerable Mg-doped layered cathodes have been exploited, some new differences relative to previous reports can be concluded by doping a heavy dose of Mg via two rational strategies. Unlike the common unit cell of the P63/mmc group by X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction reveals a large supercell of the P63 group and enhanced ordering for Na11/18Mg1/18[Ni1/4Mg1/9Mn11/18]O2 with Mg occupying both the Na and Mn sites. Compared with only one obvious voltage plateau of Na0.5[Ni0.25Mn0.75]O2 (NNM), Na11/18Mg1/18[Ni1/4Mg1/9Mn11/18]O2 (NMNMM) shows more severe voltage plateaus but with excellent electrochemical performance. Na0.5[Mg0.25Mn0.75]O2 (NMM) with Mg only occupying the Ni site displays a highly reversible whole-voltage-range oxygen redox chemistry and smooth voltage curves without any voltage hysteresis. Cationic Ni2+/Ni4+ couples are responsible for the charge compensations of NNM and NMNMM, while only the oxygen anionic reaction accounts for the capacity of NMM between 2.5 and 4.3 V. Interestingly, the Mn3+/Mn4+ pair contributes all capacity for all cathodes between 1.5 and 2.5 V. All cathodes undergo a double-phase mechanism: an irreversible P2-O2 phase transition for NNM, an enhanced reversible P2-O2 phase transition for NMNMM, and a highly reversible P2-OP4 phase transition for NMM. In addition, the designed cathodes display excellent rate capability and long-term cycling stability but with a large difference in the various voltage ranges of 2.5-4.3 and 1.5-2.5 V, respectively. This work provides a good understanding of ion doping and some new insights into exploiting high-performance materials.",

X-ray photoelectron spectra, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectra show that the P2-structure and the oxidation state of cobalt and manganese of the pristine oxide are not affected by CeO2 surface modification, and a small amount of Ce4+ ions have been reduced to Ce3+ ions, and a few Ce ions have entered the crystal lattice of the P2-oxide surface during modification with CeO2. In a voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V at a current density of 20 mA g−1, 2.00 wt% CeO2-modified Na0.67Co0.25Mn0.75O2 delivers a maximum discharge capacity of 135.93 mA h g−1, and the capacity retentions are 91.96% and 83.38% after 50 and 100 cycles, respectively. However, the pristine oxide presents a low discharge capacity of 116.14 mA h g−1, and very low retentions of 39.83% and 25.96% after 50 and 100 cycles, respectively. It is suggested that the CeO2 modification enhances not only the maximum discharge capacity, but also the electric conductivity and the sodium ion diffusivity, resulting in a significant enhancement of the cycling stability and the kinetic characteristics of the P2-type oxide cathode.",

        "abstract": "NASICON‐type cathode with remarkable ionic conductivity is perspective candidate for fast‐charging sodium‐ion battery. However, severely restricted by low electrical conductivity and poor interfacial kinetics, it usually delivers poor charge transfer kinetics. Different from traditional carbon compositing with high carbon contents, herein, a trace carbon incorporation tactic is proposed based on a typical NASICON‐structured Na3V2(PO4)3. First, particle‐growth process of Na3V2(PO4)3 is regulated via incorporating carbon dot, significantly reducing its particle size to shorten charge diffusion path. Second, electrical conductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3 is improved without sacrificing its high electrochemical activity due to the incorporated trace carbon content (0.76 wt.%). Third, Na3V2(PO4)3‐electrolyte interface structure is optimized by abundant functional groups from the incorporated carbon dot, enabling a thin and stable NaF‐rich CEI layer to boost interface kinetics. As a result, carbon dot endows Na3V2(PO4)3 with ultrastable cyclability up to 20 k cycles (capacity retention of 98.4%) and excellent rate capability (up to 200 C) in half cell, as well as high energy density (368.7 Wh kg−1) and fast charging property (≈110.2 s per charging with 250.8 Wh kg−1 input) in full cell. This study carves a new path for developing fast‐charging cathode, as is increasingly desired for present energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "Biochemistry-directed synthesis of functional nanomaterials has attracted great interest in energy storage, catalysis and other applications. The unique ability of biological systems to guide molecule self-assembling facilitates the construction of distinctive architectures with desirable physicochemical characteristics. Herein, we report a biochemistry-directed \"bottom-up\" approach to construct hollow porous microspheres of polyanion materials for sodium ion batteries. Two kinds of polyanions, i.e. Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na3.12Fe2.44(P2O7)2, are employed as cases in this study. The microalgae cell realizes the formation of a spherical \"bottom\" bio-precursor. Its tiny core is subjected to destruction and its tough shell tends to carbonize upon calcination, resulting in the hollow porous microspheres for the \"top\" product. The nanoscale crystals of the polyanion materials are tightly enwrapped by the highly-conductive framework in the hollow microsphere, resulting in the hierarchical nano-microstructure. The whole formation process is disclosed as a \"bottom-up\" mechanism. Moreover, the biochemistry-directed self-assembly process is confirmed to play a crucial role in the construction of the final architecture. Taking advantage of the well-defined hollow-microsphere architecture, the abundant interior voids and the highly-conductive framework, polyanion materials show favourable sodium-intercalation kinetics. Both materials are capable of high-rate long-term cycling. After five hundred cycles at 20 C and 10 C, Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na(3.12)Fe2.44(P2O7)2 retain 96.2% and 93.1% of the initial capacity, respectively. Therefore, the biochemistry-directed technique provides a low-cost, highly-efficient and widely applicable strategy to produce high-performance polyanion-based cathodes for sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Polymer cathode materials are promising alternatives to inorganic counterparts for both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high theoretical capacity, adjustable molecular structure, and strong adaptability to different counterions in batteries, etc. However, they suffer from poor practical capacity and low rate capability because of their intrinsically poor conductivity. Herein, we report the synthesis of self-assembled graphene/poly(anthraquinonyl sufide) (PAQS) composite aerogel (GPA) with efficient integration of a three-dimensional (3D) graphene framework with electroactive PAQS particles via a novel dispersion-assembly strategy which can be used as a free-standing flexible cathode upon mechanical pressing. The entire GPA cathode can deliver the highest capacity of 156 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C (1 C = 225 mAh g-1) with an ultrahigh utilization (94.9%) of PAQS and exhibits an excellent rate performance with 102 mAh g-1 at 20 C in LIBs. Furthermore, the flexible GPA film was also tested as cathode for SIBs and demonstrated a high-rate capability with 72 mAh g-1 at 5 C and an ultralong cycling stability (71.4% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 0.5 C) which has rarely been achieved before. Such excellent electrochemical performance of GPA as cathode for both LIBs and SIBs could be ascribed to the fast redox kinetics and electron transportation within GPA, resulting from the interconnected conductive framework of graphene and the intimate interaction between graphene and PAQS through an efficient wrapping structure. This approach opens a universal way to develop cathode materials for powerful batteries with different metal-based counter electrodes.",

Herein, we design a highly dense graphene encapsulated nitrogen-doped carbon@Sn (HD N-C@Sn/G) compact monolith with Sn nanoparticles double-encapsulated by N-C and graphene, which exhibits a high density of 2.6 g cm-3 and a high conductivity of 212 S m-1.

Specifically, it delivers a high volumetric capacity of 2692 mAh cm-3 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 and an ultra-long cycling stability exceeding 1500 cycles at 1.0 A g-1 with only 0.019% capacity decay per cycle in lithium ion batteries. Besides, in-situ TEM and ex-situ SEM have revealed that the unique double-encapsulated structure effectively mitigates drastic volume variation of the tin nanoparticles during electrode cycling. Furthermore, the full cell using HD N-C@Sn/G as anode and LiCoO2 as cathode displays a superior cycling stability.

However, the sodiation reagents reported so far are basically polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) wth low reductive potential (~0.1 V vs. Na+/Na), which could easily cause over-sodiation and structural deterioration of the presodiated cathodes. In this work, Aromatic ketones (AKs) are rationally designed as mild presodiating reagents by introducing a carbonyl group (C=O) into PAHs to balance the conjugated and inductive effect. As the representatives, two compounds 9-Fluorenoneb (9-FN) and Benzophenone (BP) manifest favorable equilibrium potential of 1.55 V and 1.07 V (vs. Na+/Na), respectively. Note that 9-FN demonstrates versatile presodiating capability toward multiple Na uptake hosts (tunneled Na0.44MnO2, layered Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2, polyanionic Na4Fe2.91(PO4)2P2O7, Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)2F3), enabling greatly improved initial charging capacity of the cathode to balance the irrevisible capacity of the anode.

        "abstract": "The development of solid‐state sodium‐ion batteries (SSSBs) heavily hinges on the development of an superionic Na+ conductor (SSC) that features high conductivity, (electro)chemical stability, and deformability. The construction of heterogeneous structures offers a promising approach to comprehensively enhancing these properties in a way that differs from traditional structural optimization. Here, this work exploits the structural variance between high‐ and low‐coordination halide frameworks to develop a new class of halide heterogeneous structure electrolytes (HSEs). The halide HSEs incorporating a UCl3‐type high‐coordination framework and amorphous low‐coordination phase achieves the highest Na+ conductivity (2.7 mS cm−1 at room temperature, RT) among halide SSCs so far. By discerning the individual contribution of the crystalline bulk, amorphous region, and interface, this work unravels the synergistic ion conduction within halide HSEs and provides a comprehensive explanation of the amorphization effect. More importantly, the excellent deformability, high‐voltage stability, and expandability of HSEs enable effective SSSB integration. Using a cold‐pressed cathode electrode composite of uncoated Na0.85Mn0.5Ni0.4Fe0.1O2 and HSEs, the SSSBs present stable cycle performance with a capacity retention of 91.0% after 100 cycles at 0.2 C.",

        "abstract": "Iron-based Prussian blue (FeHCF) has great application potential in the large-scale production of sodium-ion (Na+) batteries because of its high theoretical capacity and abundant Fe ore resources. However, the Fe(CN)6 vacancies and crystal water seriously affect the electrochemical performance. Herein, a Cu-doped FeHCF (Cu-FeHCF) cathode material is successfully prepared directly by a coprecipitation method. After Cu doping, the monoclinic structure and the quasi-cubic morphology are retained, but the electrochemical performance is significantly improved. In addition to few Fe(CN)6 vacancies and low crystal water, the improved performance is also related to the enhanced electrochemical activity of low-spin Fe and the stabilizing effect of Cu on the crystal structure. Moreover, Cu doping also controls the side reaction to a certain extent. As a result, after Cu doping, the initial discharge capacity is enhanced from 107.9 to 127.4 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1, especially the capacities contributed by low-spin Fe increase from 30.0, 21.7, and 16.7 mA h g-1 to 48.8, 45.4, and 43.7 mA h g-1 for the first three cycles, respectively. Even at 2 A g-1, Cu-FeHCF still has a promising initial capacity of 82.3 mA h g-1 and only a 0.047% capacity decay rate for each cycle over 500 cycles. Therefore, Cu-FeHCF shows excellent application potential in the field of Na+ energy storage batteries.",

However, the irreversible anionic redox activity of Na-ion layered cathode materials results in structural distortion and poor capacity retention upon cycling. Herein, we develop a facile doping strategy by incorporating copper into the layered cathode material lattice to relieve the irreversible oxygen oxidation at high voltages. On the basis of a comprehensive comparison with the Cu-free material, both the over-oxidation of O2- to trapped molecular O2 and Mn-related Jahn-Teller distortion have been effectively inhibited by restraining both the oxygen activity and participation of Mn4+/Mn3+ redox activity. Not limited to discovering stable cycling behavior at high voltages after Cu substitution, our findings also highlight an effective strategy to stabilize the anionic redox activity and elucidate the stabilization mechanism of Cu substitution, thus paving the way for further improvement of layered oxide cathode materials for high-energy Na-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "A detailed study of the intercalation/de‐intercalation mechanisms of PF6‐ anions in a graphite cathode of sodium dual‐ion batteries is carried out by cyclic voltammetry. The influence of the continuous anion intercalation/de‐intercalation on the graphite structure is investigated by ex‐situ XRD after cycling. It was concluded that the intercalation/de‐intercalation occurs through a combination of diffusion‐controlled and pseudocapacitive mechanisms. Initially, the contribution of the diffusion‐controlled is significant, specifically at the highest voltage and at the lowest scan rates which agrees with the slow kinetic of this mechanism and its usual prevalence in carbon materials with a graphitic structure. However, the continuous anion intercalation/de‐intercalation causes some deterioration of the graphite structural order, even from the initial cycles, as it was demonstrated by the evolution of the crystalline parameters, interlayer spacing, d002, and crystallite size, Lc. This deterioration hinders the diffusion‐controlled anion intercalation/de‐intercalation and, as a consequence, the pseudocapacitive becomes the main mechanism along cycling. Therefore, since graphite is capable of intercalating PF6‐ anions at high voltages through a capacitive mechanism, with its consequent rapid kinetics, this carbon material is an excellent candidate for using as cathode in high power sodium dual‐ion batteries, in which, kinetically fast mechanisms are required.",

        "abstract": "Lacking strategies to simultaneously address the narrow interlayer spacing, irreversible phase transitions, dissolution and electrical transport issues of vanadium oxides is restricting their application in aqueous zinc‐ion batteries. Herein, to address these challenges concurrently, an organic‐inorganic hybrid cathode is explored, HNaV6O16·4H2O‐Glu (HNVO‐Glu), through a guest material‐mediated NVO synthesis strategy utilizing glutamic acid (Glu) to induce Na substituted by proton and enable crystal transformation of Na2V6O16·3H2O (NVO). Specially, Glu insertion kills three birds with one arrow: i) induces the formation of a structurally stable monoclinic HNaV6O16·4H2O phase by introducing H into the NVO framework, preventing structural phase change and collapse of NVO material; ii) acts as a pillar to expand the interlayer spacing, which improves the Zn2+ diffusion kinetics; moreover, the polar groups on the Glu surface weaken the electrostatic interaction between Zn2+ and the host materials, further enhancing the zinc‐ionic transport rate; iii) enhances the electrical conductivity of HNVO by converting the p‐type semiconductor into the n‐type semiconductor structure. Consequently, the HNVO‐Glu exhibits a high specific capacity (354.6 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1), excellent Zn2+ diffusion capability (10−9 to 10−7 cm2 s−1) and outstanding cycling stability with a capacity retention of 87.2% after 12 000 cycles at 10 A g−1.",

It is induced by the synergistic incorporation of Ni and Ti for the reinforced O(2p)-Mn(3d-eg*) hybridization, which leads to mitigated Jahn-Teller distortion of MnO6 octahedra, contracted transition-metal oxide slabs, and enlarged Na layer spacings. The thermodynamically favorable solid solution pathway rewards the SIBs with excellent cycling stability (87.2% capacity retention after 500 cycles) and rate performance (100.5 mA h g-1 at 2500 mA g-1).

        "abstract": "Several major roadblocks, including the \"shuttle effect\" caused by the dissolved higher-order sodium polysulfides (NaPSs), extremely poor conductivity of sulfur cathodes, and sluggish conversion kinetics of charging-discharging reactions, have hindered the commercialization of sodium-sulfur batteries (NaSBs). In our study, representative C2N-based single-atom catalysts (SACs), TM@C2N (TM = Fe, Ni and V), are proposed to improve the comprehensive performance of NaSBs. Based on first-principles calculations, we first discuss in detail the anchoring behavior of all adsorption systems, TM@C2N/(S8 and NaPSs). The results indicate that compared to pristine C2N, TM@C2N substrates exhibit a stronger capability to capture S8/NaPSs clusters through physical/chemical binding, with V@C2N showing the most outstanding capability ranging from -2.37 to -5.03 eV. The density of states analysis reveals that metallic properties can be well maintained before and after adsorption of polysulfides. More importantly, TM@C2N configurations can greatly reduce the energy barriers of charging and discharging reactions, thereby accelerating the conversion efficiency of NaSBs. It is worth mentioning that V@C2N has lower charge-discharge energy barriers and Na ion migration rates, since the embedded TM atom weakens the strong binding of Na+ in the N6 cavity of C2N. The intrinsic mechanism analysis reveals that the interaction between the d orbitals of V and the p orbitals of S leads to the weakening of Na-S bonds, which can not only effectively inhibit the shuttle effect, but also promote the dissociation of Na2S. Overall, this work not only offers excellent catalytic materials, but also provides vital guidance for designing SACs in NaSBs.",

        "abstract": "Ultrafast-charging is the focus of next-generation rechargeable batteries for widespread economic success by reducing the time cost. However, the poor ion diffusion rate, intrinsic electronic conductivity and structural stability of cathode materials seriously hinder the development of ultrafast-charging technology. To overcome these challenges, an interfacial dynamics and thermodynamics synergistic strategy is proposed to synchronously enhance the fast-charging capability and structural stability of polyanion cathode materials. As a case study, a Na3V2(PO4)3 composite (NVP/NSC) is successfully obtained by introducing an interface layer derived from N/S co-doped carbon dots. Density functional theory calculations validate that the interfacial bonding effect of V–N/S–C significantly reduces the Na+ transport energy barrier. D-band center theory analysis confirms the downward shift of the V d-band center enhances the strength of the V–O bond and considerably inhibits irreversible phase transformation. Benefitting from this interfacial synergistic strategy, NVP/NSC achieves a high capability and excellent cycling stability with a surprisingly low carbon content (2.23%) at an extremely high rate of 100C for 10 000 cycles (87.2 mA h g−1, 0.0028% capacity decay per cycle). Furthermore, a superior performance at 5C (115.3 mA h g−1, 92.1% capacity retention after 800 cycles) is exhibited by the NVP/NSC‖HC full cell. These findings provide timely new insights for the systematic design of ultrafast-charging cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "The ever-increasing demand for large-scale energy storage has driven the prosperous investigation of sodium-ion batteries (NIBs). As a promising cathode candidate for NIBs, P2-type Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 (NaNMO), a prototype sodium layered oxide, has attracted extensive attention because of its high operating voltage and high capacity density. Although its electrochemical properties have been extensively investigated, the fundamental charge compensation mechanism, i.e., the cationic and anionic redox reactions, is still elusive. In this report, we have systematically investigated the transition metal and oxygen redox reactions of NaNMO nanoflakes using bulk-sensitive soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS) and full-range mapping of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (mRIXS) from an atomic-level view. We show that the bulk Mn3+/Mn4+ redox couple emerges from the first discharge process with the increment of inactive Mn3+ upon cycling, which may have a negative effect on the cyclability. In contrast, the bulk Ni redox mainly stems from the Ni2+/Ni3+ redox couple, in contrast to the conventional wisdom of the Ni2+/Ni4+ redox couple. The quantitative analysis provides unambiguous evidence for the continuous reduction of the average valence state of Mn and Ni over extended cycles, leading to the voltage fading. In addition, we reveal that the oxygen anions also participate in the charge compensation process mainly through irreversible oxygen release rather than reversible lattice oxygen redox. Such understanding is vital for the precise design and optimization of NaNMO electrodes for rechargeable NIBs with outstanding performance.",

        "abstract": "As one of the important devices for large-scale electrochemical energy storage, sodium-ion batteries have received much attention due to the abundant resources of raw materials. However, whether it is a base station power source, an energy storage power station, or a start-stop power supply, long energy cycle life (more than 5000 cycles), high stability, and safety performance are application prerequisites. Regrettably, currently, few sodium-ion batteries can meet this requirement, mainly due to shortcomings in positive electrode performance. We report a sufficiently stable sodium-ion battery cathode material, Na2Fe0.95P2O7, that retains 97.5% capacity after 5000 charge/discharge cycles. The use of nonstoichiometry in the lattice enables simultaneous modification of the crystal and electronic structure, promoting Na2Fe0.95P2O7 to be extremely stable while still being able to achieve a capacity of 92 mAh g-1 and stable cycling at high temperatures up to 60 °C. Our results confirm the positive effect of nonstoichiometric ratios on the performance of Na2Fe0.95P2O7 and provide a reliable idea to promote the practical application of sodium-ion batteries.",

The optimized and modified nitrogen and boron codoped carbon layer, Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (denoted as NVPF-PCNB-20), illustrated better rate capability and cycling performance. The discharge capacities of NVPF-PCNB-20 at 0.5C and 10C were 109 and 90 mAh g-1, respectively, and the capacity retention rate was 93.2% after 100 cycles at 0.5C and 92.8% after 750 cycles at 10C. Through in situ X-ray diffraction analysis of NVPF-PCNB-20, the results show that the modified Na3V2(PO4)2F3 has excellent cycle reversibility. The scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images reveal that NVPF-PCNB-20 particles were finer and covered by a uniform coating. The results show that the ionic liquid-acrylic acid copolymer not only make the material dispersion more uniform but also enhance the electronic conductivity and sodium storage performance of Na3V2(PO4)3F3 effectively.

X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared measurements were used to characterize the materials and their surface species before and after controlled-atmosphere storage. It was determined that the exposure of untreated NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 powders to moisture results in desodiation and material degradation, leading to poor cycling.

        "abstract": "NASICON (sodium superionic conductor) materials are promising host compounds for the reversible capture of Na+ ions, finding prior application in batteries as solid-state electrolytes and cathodes/anodes. Given their affinity for Na+ ions, these materials can be used in Faradaic deionization (FDI) for the selective removal of sodium over other competing ions. Here, we investigate the selective removal of sodium over other alkali and alkaline-earth metal cations from aqueous electrolytes when using a NASICON-based mixed Ti-V phase as an intercalation electrode, namely, sodium titanium vanadium phosphate (NTVP). Galvanostatic cycling experiments in three-electrode cells with electrolytes containing Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Li+ reveal that only Na+ and Li+ can intercalate into the NTVP crystal structure, while other cations show capacitive response, leading to a material-intrinsic selectivity factor of 56 for Na+ over K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+. Furthermore, electrochemical titration experiments together with modeling show that an intercalation mechanism with a limited miscibility gap for Na+ in NTVP mitigates the state-of-charge gradients to which phase-separating intercalation electrodes are prone when operated under electrolyte flow. NTVP electrodes are then incorporated into an FDI cell with automated fluid recirculation to demonstrate up to 94% removal of sodium in streams with competing alkali/alkaline-earth cations with 10-fold higher concentration, showing process selectivity factors of 3-6 for Na+ over cations other than Li+. Decreasing the current density can improve selectivity up to 25% and reduce energy consumption by as much as ∼50%, depending on the competing ion. The results also indicate the utility of NTVP for selective lithium recovery.",

However, the development of an HCF cathode with high cycling stability and voltage retention is still impeded by the unavoidable Fe(CN)6 vacancies (VFeCN) and H2O in the materials. Here, a repair method is proposed that significantly reduces the VFeCN content in potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate (KMHCF) enabled by the reducibility of sodium citrate and removal of ligand H2O at high temperature (KMHCF‐H). The KMHCF‐H obtained at 90 °C contains only 2% VFeCN, and the VFeCN is concentrated in the lattice interior. Such an integrated Fe–CN–Mn surface structure of the KMHCF‐H cathode with repaired surface VFeCN allows preferential decomposition of potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (KFSI) in the electrolyte, which constitutes a dense anion‐dominated cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) , inhibiting effectively Mn dissolution into the electrolyte. Consequently, the KMHCF‐H cathode exhibits excellent cycling performance for both half‐cell (95.2 % at 0.2 Ag−1 after 2000 cycles) and full‐cell (99.4 % at 0.1 Ag−1 after 200 cycles).

However, the concomitant inorganic salt is usually recognized as impurities and plays an obscure and even contradictory effect on the regulation of pore structure in HCs. Herein, a two-step pyrolysis procedure to the representative salty coal is performed, in which the acid washing program is selectively inserted. It is illuminated that salt acts as a template or activating agent for the generation of open pores at low temperatures but inhibits the closure of pores during the following high-temperature carbonization. The optimized HC delivers a reversible capacity of 322.4 mAh g-1, a high plateau capacity of 192 mAh g-1, and an initial coulombic efficiency of 80%, outperforming to most coal-based HCs.

In this study, we prepared an NVP@C composite using a one-step hydrothermal method (at 180 °C) and consecutively calcined at different temperatures (750, 800, 850, and 900 °C). All the samples were thoroughly characterized and the changes in the crystal structure and particle size distribution were investigated using a Rietveld refinement method. NVP calcined at 850 °C exhibits the best battery performance with a discharge capacity of 94 mA h g−1 and retention up to 90% after 250 cycles at 2C. It also exhibits remarkable cycling stability with 94% (63 mA h g−1) retention after 2000 cycles at high-rate endurance (10C). The observed electrochemical performances of the samples were correlated with improved electrical conductivity due to the conductive carbon mixing with Na3V2(PO4)3 and enhancement in the crystallinity.",

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries have attracted great attention for large scale energy storage devices to replace lithium-ion batteries. As a promising polyanionic cathode material of sodium-ion batteries, Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) belonging to NASICON exhibits large gap space and excellent structural stability, leading to a high energy density and ultralong cycle lifespan. To improve its stability and Na ion mobility, K+ cations are introduced into NVPF crystal as in situ partial substitution for Na+. The influence of K+ in situ substitution on crystal structure, electronic properties, kinetic properties, and electrochemical performance of NVPF are investigated. Through ex situ examination, it turns out that K+ occupied Na1 ion, in which the K+ does not participate in the charge-discharge process and plays a pillar role in improving the mobility of Na+. Moreover, the doping of K+ cation can reduce the bandgap energy and improve the electronic conductivity. Besides, the optimal K+ doping concentration in N0.92K0.08VPF/C is found so as to achieve rapid Na+ migration and reversible phase transition. The specific capacity of N0.92K0.08VPF/C is as high as 128.8 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C, and at 10 C its rate performance is excellent, which shows a capacity of 113.3 mAh g-1.",

        "abstract": "The development of aqueous rechargeable sodium batteries (ARSBs) demands high-performance electrode materials, especially anode materials with low operating potential and competent electrochemical properties. The lithium/sodium vanadium phosphate family with good structural stability and abundant vanadium chemistry versatility is a promising series for energy storage applications. Herein, a new member in the sodium vanadium phosphate family, i.e. NaV3(PO4)3, is introduced as a novel anode candidate for ARSBs. For the first time, its sodium intercalation mechanism in an aqueous electrolyte is explored, and moreover, the well-aligned NaV3(PO4)3@porous carbon nanofiber is constructed to fulfil its full potential. Based on the reversible phase transformation and 3D open framework, the NaV3(PO4)3 is demonstrated to be reliable in the aqueous electrolyte. Favored by the well-aligned, highly porous and hierarchical 1D nanoarchitecture, the freestanding aligned NaV3(PO4)3@porous carbon hybrid film achieves fast electron/ion transport capability and good mechanical flexibility, resulting in its superior high-rate properties and excellent cycling durability. Moreover, a full cell is fabricated using the aligned NaV3(PO4)3@C nanofiber as the anode and Na0.44MnO2 as the cathode. The cell is capable of high-rate long-term cycling, which retains 84% of the capacity after five hundred cycles at alternate 20 and 5C. Therefore, this work not only demonstrates a novel high-performance anode material for ARSBs, but also introduces a general applicable and highly efficient architecture of aligned 1D nanofibers for energy storage applications.",

However, the sluggish kinetics and inferior stability of conventional sodium-ion storage anode materials are major challenges for the practical utilization of SICs. In this work, interconnected urchin-like hollow Na2Ti3O7 (Na2Ti3O7-IcUH) chains were designed and prepared by a simple one step template-assisting method. Through a variety of controlled experiments, we explored how to effectively engineer the crystal-oriented growth and string the urchin-like spheres together. Benefiting from its urchin-like hollow structure and fully exposed (001) facet, the resulting Na2Ti3O7-IcUH exhibits a superior rate capability of 96.2 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1. Meanwhile, the interconnected three-dimensional (3D) primary structure endows Na2Ti3O7-IcUH with excellent cyclic stability (15% capacity loss at 5 A g-1 after 2000 cycles). By coupling with an active carbon cathode, the as-assembled SIC successfully demonstrates a high energy density of 134.3 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 125 W kg-1 and 38.2 Wh kg-1 at a high-power density of 2500 W kg-1, as well as a superior capacity retention of 75% after 2000 cycles at 2 A g-1 within 1-4 V.",

        "abstract": "O3-type layered oxide cathode exhibits great application potential for practical sodium-ion batteries, due to its cost-effectiveness, abundant sodium and manganese resources, and high theoretical capacity. However, the irreversible phase transition, coupled with rapid capacity decay, which is primarily attributed to the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn3+, remains a significant bottleneck for commercial application. Additionally, the sluggish kinetics during the (de)sodiation process require urgent improvement. Herein, an electronic structure regulation strategy is proposed by low-valence Li/Cu co-substitution to address these issues. The roles of Li/Cu on the electronic structure, structural evolution, and electrochemical properties in the Na0.96Ni0.22Fe0.2Mn0.5Li0.04Cu0.04O2 (NFMLC) cathode are comprehensively explored through systematic in situ/ex situ characterization techniques and theoretical calculations. The results reveal that this strategy effectively activates more Ni2+/3+ and Fe3+/4+ redox reactions above 2.5 V, while suppressing Mn3+/4+ redox activity below 2.5 V, thereby achieving highly structural reversibility. Therefore, the NFMLC electrode displays excellent long-term cycling stability (81.5% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 5 C), and significantly enhanced rate performance (from 45.5% to 80.4% under a ratio of 5 C to 0.5 C).

In this work, we aim to form thin films of sodium manganese oxide (NMO) cathode materials for NIBs using atomic layer deposition (ALD) with the vision to isolate and study these interfacial processes in the absence of bulk NMO. We combine established chemistries for ALD of manganese oxide (MnOx) using Mn(thd)3/O3 and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) using NaOtBu/H2O and adjust the sequence and ratios of these two chemistries to form NaxMnyO alloy films. We identify that increasing the O3 exposure during Mn(thd)3/O3 ALD beyond previously reported values increases the growth rate of MnOx from 0.23 to 0.62 Å per cycle and provides improved uniformity, yielding predominantly Mn5O8. Furthermore, alloying Mn(thd)3/O3 with NaOtBu/H2O mutually enhances the growth rate of both ALD chemistries, yielding a growth rate of ∼9 Å per supercycle for a 1 : 1 cycle ratio. This enhancement in growth arises from sub-surface reactions, including the reaction of NaOtBu to a depth of ∼1.3 nm into bulk MnOx to form Na2MnOx. By tuning cycle ratios and growth conditions, we demonstrate control over the NaxMnyO composition and measure different electrochemical properties depending on the composition. The formation of NMO thin films with controlled thickness and composition established in this work provides a means to systematically study interfacial processes occurring in NMO cathode materials for NIBs.",

By reasonably modulating the ratio of water and ethanol in the solution, the as-synthesized NVP/C sample exhibited a three-dimensional interconnected structure with hierarchical micro/meso/macro-pores.

        "abstract": "Compared to Li+ and Na+ ion‐conducting sulfides with conductivities of ≈10⁻2 S cm⁻1 at room temperature, oxide ceramics typically exhibit conductivities an order of magnitude lower, rendering them less attractive as electrolytes for all‐solid‐state batteries (ASSBs). This study presents NASICON‐based electrolyte, achieving a remarkable conductivity of 6.0 × 10⁻3 S cm⁻1 at room temperature, rivaling that of sulfide‐based electrolytes. This is accomplished by optimizing the composition in the range Na3+x+yZr2−yAlySi2+xP1−xO12 (0.10 ≤ x ≤ 0.50, 0 ≤ y ≤ 0.1). Despite the issue of reduced sinterability with increasing Si/P ratio due to the formation of a viscous SiO2‐rich grain boundary interphase, the addition of Al2O3 effectively reduces the viscosity and improves the sinterability. In other words, a strategy of engineering the liquid phase that is in situ generated from the host phase is viable. The enhanced conductivity is attributed not only to the lowered grain boundary resistivity but also to lattice expansion from modified Na occupations in the crystal structure. Furthermore, this material demonstrates a wide electrochemical window, suppressed partial electronic conductivity, low polarization voltage in direct contact with a Na anode, and charge‐discharge cycles with minimal polarization when directly interfaced with a NASICON‐type cathode, repositioning it as a promising electrolyte for ceramic ASSBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted widespread attention for large‐scale energy storage, but one major drawback, i.e., the limited capacity of cathode materials, impedes their practical applications. Oxygen redox reactions in layered oxide cathodes are proven to contribute additionally high specific capacity, while such cathodes often suffer from irreversible structural transitions, causing serious capacity fading and voltage decay upon cycling, and the formation process of the oxidized oxygen species remains elusive. Herein, a series of Al‐doped P2‐type Na0.6Ni0.3Mn0.7O2 cathode materials for SIBs are reported and the corresponding charge compensation mechanisms are investigated qualitatively and quantitatively. The combined analyses reveal that Al doping boosts the reversible oxygen redox reactions through the reductive coupling reactions between orphaned O 2p states in NaOAl local configurations and Ni4+ ions, as directly evidenced by X‐ray absorption fine structure results. Additionally, Al doping also induces an increased interlayer spacing and inhibits the unfavorable P2 to O2 phase transition upon desodiation/sodiation, which is common in P2‐type Mn‐based cathode materials, leading to the great improvement in capacity retention and rate capability. This work provides deeper insights into the development of structurally stable and high‐capacity layered cathode materials for SIBs with anion–cation synergetic contributions.",

        "abstract": "Self-healing functional materials can repair cracks and damage inside the battery, ensuring the stability of the battery material structure. This feature minimizes performance degradation during the charging and discharging processes, improving the efficiency and stability of the battery. Here, we have developed a novel healing conductive two-dimensional sulfur iodide (SI4) composite cathode. This process integrates both sulfur and iodine compounds into carbon nanocages, forming a SI4@C core-shell structure. This cathode design improves electrical conductivity and repairability, facilitates rapid activation, and ensures structural integrity, resulting in a typical Na-SI4 battery with high capacity and an exceptionally long cycle life. At 10.0 A g-1, the capacity of the Na-SI4 battery can still reach 217.4 mAh g-1 after more than 500 cycles, and the capacity decay rate per cycle is only 0.06%. In addition, the cathode exhibits a cascade redox reaction involving S and I, contributing to its high capacity. The in situ growth of a carbon shell further enhances the conductivity and structural robustness of the entire cathode. The flexibility and bendability of SI4@C-carbon cloth make it applicable for flexible electronic devices, providing more possibilities for battery design. The strategy of engineering a two-dimensional self-healing structure to construct a superior cathode is expected to be widely applied to other electrode materials. This study provides a new pathway for designing novel binary-conversion-type sodium-ion batteries with excellent long-term cycling performance.",

LNCM in the proposed sodium-ion battery demonstrates good rate capability whose discharge capacity reaches about 90 mA h g(-1) at 10 C rate and excellent cycle stability with specific capacity of about 105 mA h g(-1) for 200 cycles at 5 C rate. Moreover, ex situ ICP-OES suggests interesting mixed-ions migration processes: In the initial two cycles, only Li(+) can intercalate into the LNCM cathode, whereas both Li(+) and Na(+) work together as the electrochemical cycles increase. Also the structural evolution of LNCM is examined in terms of ex situ XRD pattern at the end of various charge-discharge scans.

        "abstract": "P2-type Mn-based layered oxides have emerged as one of the most promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries owing to their advantages of facile preparation and high theoretical capacity. However, challenges such as phase transition and irreversible oxygen release during cycling often lead to rapid structural distortion and the formation of oxygen vacancies, ultimately resulting in rapid capacity decay. Herein, a covalency modulation strategy is adopted to address these challenges and successfully achieved a stable P2-type Mn-based layered oxide by introducing strong covalent Ni─O bonds. The robust Ni─O motif plays a crucial role in maintaining the rigidity of transition metal (TM) layered frameworks, which efficiently alleviates the structural distortion and degradation of the coordination environments of local TM sites, thereby achieving durable structural stiffness over extended cycles. In addition, the strong covalent Ni─O bonds can also stabilize the local oxygen environment, effectively suppressing the irreversible oxygen release. Benefiting from these advancements, the as-designed Na0.6Mg0.15Mn0.7Ni0.15O2 cathode displays a full solid-solution behavior with a low volume change of only 0.9% and an enhanced reversibility of lattice oxygen redox (OR) reaction. This investigation emphasizes the crucial role of covalency modulation in regulating OR chemistry and structural integrity to achieve high-energy-density Mn-based layered oxides.",

In this paper, vanadium hexacyanoferrate cathodes was firstly used for constructing rechargeable aqueous sodium-ion batteries (VHCF/WO3), and tested in the new-type electrolyte (NaP-4.6) consisting of polyethylene glycol (PEG)/H2O/NaClO4 electrolyte with a low H+ concentration (molar ratio of [H2O]:[Na+] is 4.6), which performs high stability at a high current density as high as 1000 mA g-1 with a capacity retention of 90.3% after 2000 cycles at high coulombic efficiency (above 97.8%). To understand the outstanding performance, the proton-assisted sodium ion storage mechanism and interphase chemistry of VHCF is investigated by solid-state NMR technology. It is suggested that H+ storage reaction is accompanied by the redox of vanadium atoms, and Na+-intercalation is accompanied by the redox of iron atoms. It is also observed that the complex of polyethylene glycol (PEG) with Na+ (PEG-Na+) exists on the VHCF surface which facilitates the stability of VHCF and promotes the alkali ion transfer at a high current density.

In this study, we propose a strategy to enhance the electrochemical properties of P3-type manganese-based layered oxide cathode by introducing a small amount of layered P2 and Li-O'3 phases. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) structural refinement and aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) are performed to confirm the microstructures of different samples. PXRD refinement results show that the elevated annealing temperature leads to a partial conversion of the P3 phase to the P2 phase and the addition of lithium results in the formation of a new O'3 phase in the P3/P2-layered matrix. STEM results identify the intergrowth of P3/P2 and P3/P2/O'3 in biphasic and triphasic materials, respectively. Electron energy loss spectroscopy verifies that the alkali metal layer in the O'3 phase is occupied by the lithium ion. The intergrowth of biphasic and triphasic materials in these layered P3/P2 and P3/P2/O'3 hybrid structures brings forth a positive effect on the electrochemical properties. In particular, the formation of P3/P2/O'3-intergrown hybrid structures greatly improves the cycling stability of the P3 phase that the capacity retention of P3/P2/O'3 hybrid structures remains 78%, while capacity retention of the pure P3 phase is only 54.1% after 50 cycles at a rate of 0.2 C, and the rate performance of the P3 phase has also been enhanced.",

Simply optimizing the electrode materials or designing the electrode components is no longer effective in improving the performance of CMs. Binders, as one of the electrode components, play a vital role in improving the electrochemical performance of batteries. Here we rationally designed FeF2 electrodes for the first time by optimizing electrode materials with the introduction of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and combined with a sodium alginate (SA) binder based on strong interactions. We show that the FeF2@CNTs‐SA cathode does not suffer from TM ion dissolution and delivers a high capacity of 184.7 mAh g−1 at 10 mA g−1. Moreover, the capacity of FeF2@CNTs‐SA is as high as 99.2 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1, which is a twofold increase compared to FeF2@CNTs‐PVDF. After calculating the average capacity decay rate per cycle of them, we find that FeF2@CNTs‐SA is about one‐third lower than FeF2@CNTs‐PVDF. Therefore, the SA binder can be broadly used for electrodes comprising several CMs, providing meaningful insights into mechanisms that lead to their improved electrochemical performances.",

Herein, we reveal that the solvation structure induced by different sodium salt anions determines the Na+ desolvation kinetics and interfacial film evolution process. Specifically, the weak interaction between Na+ and PF6- promoted sodium desolvation and storage kinetics. The solvation structure involving PF6- induced the anion's preferential decomposition, generating a thin, inorganic compound-rich cathode-electrolyte interphase that ensured interface stability and inhibited solvent decomposition, thereby guaranteeing electrode stability and promoting the charge transfer kinetics. This study provides clear evidence that NaPF6 is not only more compatible with industrial processes but also more conducive to battery performance. Commercial electrolyte design employing NaPF6 will undoubtedly promote the industrialization of SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion battery (SIB) is a reasonable alternative to lithium-ion battery (LIB) in the field of grid-scale energy storage systems. Unfortunately, the development of appropriate cathode material is a bottleneck in the field of SIB. In the present work, (p-TQ)-VO, formulated as (p-TQ)0.2V2O5·0.38H2O, was synthesized based on a facile hydrothermal reaction of V2O5 and methylhydroquinone (p-HTQ). And when V2O5 was replaced by VN, (p-TQ)-VN, formulated as (p-TQ)0.22V2(O/N)5, was prepared instead. The (p-TQ)-VO sample displays good electrochemical performance as the SIB cathode. And (p-TQ)-VN shows a much higher capacity at a small current density, and it can maintain structural integrity with partial topotactic phase transformation into NaxV2O5 during the discharge/charge process. A series of characterizations of (p-TQ)-VO and (p-TQ)-VN reveals the successful intercalation of p-TQ into the layered V2O5 with a (001) lattice spacing of 13.7 and 10.7 Å, respectively. In (p-TQ)-VN, partial terminal oxygen (Ot) atoms from the V-O-V layer have been substituted by N atoms, which can boost the orbital hybridization of V 3d and Ot 2p, shorten the V-Ot bonds in the c-axial direction, and elongate the V-O bonds in the ab plane with compressed {VO4N2} octahedra, giving rise to mixed-anion coordination effect. As a result, the enhanced electron densities around the Ot atoms of the V-O-V layer can facilitate the affinity toward the inserted Na+ ions, leading to partial phase conversion into NaNO2/NaNO3. Moreover, density functional density (DFT) calculations reveal that the N-incorporation can improve electron conductivity with richer molecular orbital energy levels, resulting in multistep redox reactions and enhanced capacity.",

        "abstract": "Most active materials for sodium-ion batteries suffer from the problem of low energy efficiency in the first cycle due to the loss of active sodium-ions consumed for the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI). To make up for the lost sodium-ion, pre-sodiation treatments have been applied, which are effective ways to mitigate the low initial efficiency. Here, we developed a direct-contact method to achieve the pre-sodiation for cathode and anode electrodes and demonstrated the enhanced coulombic efficiency of the first cycle with improved cyclability and reversible capacity. Moreover, we proved the formation of a thick passivation layer at the cathode-electrolyte interface during the pre-sodiation process; this contributes to the improved cycle stability by preventing the dissolution of the active material and its deposition on the anode surface. The direct-contact method is a simple and cost-effective way to complete pre-sodiation, and this simple process will be widely applicable for practical battery manufacturing.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), using the resourceful Mn-based materials as cathodes, have been considered as promising candidates for large-scale energy-storage applications. However, the representative P2-type Mn-based layered oxide cathode usually suffers from a limited specific capacity and a poor cycle life in Na-ion intercalation and deintercalation processes because of the unavoidable phase transition at a high voltage. Herein, we developed Ru-substituted P2-Na0.6MnO2 as a promising sodium host with a high reversible capacity and cycle life. The multiple characterization investigations reveal that Ru substitution could improve the electronic and ionic conductions and particularly suppress the phase transition of P2-OP4, resulting in the extension of the single-phase reaction region. Ru substitution not only enhances the specific capacity (209.3 mA h g-1) but also improves the rate capability (∼100 mA h g-1 at 50 C) and cycling stability. This work may open a new avenue for designing and fabricating SIBs by using Mn-based cathodes with high capacity and stability.",

        "abstract": "The instability of interfacial solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer of metallic sodium (Na) anode during cycles results in the rapid capacity decay of sodium metal batteries (SMBs). Herein, the concept of interfacial protection engineering of Na nanoparticles (Na-NPs) is proposed first to achieve stable, dendrite-free, and long-life SMB. Employing an ion-exchange strategy, conformal Sn-Na alloy-SEI on the interface of Na-NPs is constructed, forming Sn@Na-NPs. The stable alloy-based SEI layer possesses the following three advantages: 1) significantly enhancing the transport dynamics of Na+ ions and electrons; 2) enabling the well-distributed deposition of Na+ ions to avoid the growth of dendrites; and 3) protecting the Sn@Na-NPs anode from the attack of electrolyte, thereby reducing the parasitic reaction and boosting the Coulombic efficiency of SMBs. Because of these virtues, the symmetric Sn@Na-NPs cell shows an ultralow voltage hysteresis of 0.54 V at 10 mA cm-2 after 600 h. Paired with the Na3 V2 (PO4 )2 O2 F (NaVPF) cathode, the NaVPF-Sn@Na-NPs full cell exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 89.2 mAh g-1 at 1 C and a high capacity retention of 81.6% after 600 cycles.",

Herein, a delicate multicomponent modulation strategy is proposed to tackle these two issues simultaneously, in which Li+ and Ti4+ are introduced to replace the Ni2+ and Mn4+, respectively, whereas the Na+ content is also designed according to the principle of charge balance. Consequently, the designed cathode (Na0.72Ni0.28Li0.05Mn0.57Ti0.10O2) can deliver an enchanting cycling stability of 80% at 1 C after 200 cycles along with a considerable rate performance of 82.7 mAh g−1 at 5 C. In situ X‐ray diffraction measurement demonstrates the destructive P2‐O2 phase transition is suppressed and converted into a P2‐Z phase transition with superior reversibility as well as smooth charge/discharge curves with better Na+/vacancy disordering. In addition, the full cell matched with hard carbon anode delivers an excellent energy density of 263.4 Wh kg−1 at 37.3 W kg−1, exhibiting great practicality.

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is one of the most potential cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), but its actual electrochemical performance is limited by the defects of large electron and ion transfer resistance. Multicomponent design is considered an effective method to optimize the conductivity of NVP electrodes. Therefore, Cr and Si are added in NVP to form a multielement component of Na3V1.9Cr0.1(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1 (NVP-CS). It is confirmed that 3d electrons of Cr are beneficial for improving the conductivity and increasing the average potential by activating V4+/V5+. Theoretical calculations show that the introduction of Si changes the electronic structure of V and O, thus promoting the electrochemical reaction of V3+/V4+ to exert higher capacity. Due to the coordination of the two elements, a lower migration barrier is obtained in NVP-CS. Specifically, NVP-CS retains the advantages of single-doped electrodes very well (capacity retention of 90% after 300 cycles at 1 C and a high capacity of 94.1 mA h g-1 at 5 C, compared to NVP with only 82.6% capacity retention at 1 C and 59.4 mA h g-1 at 5 C). The excellent electrochemical performance results show that NVP can be successfully optimized by the introduction of Cr and Si.

        "abstract": "This research highlights the efficacy of NaNbO3 as a coating for P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 cathodes in sodium-ion batteries. The coating enhances the kinetic behavior and cyclability of the electrochemical cells, as shown by electrochemical measurements. XRD analysis indicates that Nb does not incorporate into the cathode structure, implying a physical interaction between the coating and the cathode material. XRF analysis and EDX mapping confirm the actual composition and uniform dispersion of elements throughout the sample, while the electron micrographs evidence the occurrence of NaNbO3 particles modifying the surface of the layered oxide. The Ni4+/Ni3+ and Ni3+/Ni2+ redox pairs, along with the partially reversible oxidation of oxide to peroxide anions, contribute significantly to cell capacity, as revealed by XPS spectra. This last effect and the appearance of a co-intercalated phase at high voltage are positive factors to provide fast kinetics. Cyclic voltammograms show that samples coated with 2–3% NaNbO3 have superior rate capability, with high capacitive response and apparent diffusion coefficients. These samples also have low impedance at the electrode–electrolyte interface, which helps deliver a high capacity at 5C. Further cycling at 1C shows improved cyclability in the bare and 3% coated samples, due to their higher diffusion coefficients on charging. Notably, the 3% NaNbO3-coated sample exhibits excellent cyclability below 0 °C, making it a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries.",

However, during the synthesis, crystal defects such as vacancies and the incorporation of crystal water can lead to issues such as diminished capacity and suboptimal cycling stability. In the current study, a Y-tube assisted coprecipitation method was used to synthesize iron-based Prussian blue analogues, and the optimized feed flow rate during synthesis contributed to the successful preparation of the material with a formula of Na1.56Fe[Fe(CN)6]0.90□0.10·2.42H2O, representing a low-defect cathode material. This approach cleverly utilizes the Y-tube component to enhance the micro-mixing of materials in the co-precipitation reaction, featuring simplicity, low cost, user-friendly, and the ability to be used in continuous production. Electrochemical performance tests show that the sample retains 69.8% of its capacity after 200 cycles at a current density of 0.5C (1C = 140 mA g−1) and delivers a capacity of 71.9 mA h g−1 at a high rate of 10C.

Here, we present a Li/Ti cosubstitution strategy to modify the electronic configuration of oxygen elements in the O3-type layered oxide cathode. This deliberate modulation simultaneously mitigates the phase transitions and counteracts the weakening of the shielding effect resulting from the extraction of sodium ions, thus enhancing the electrostatic bonding within the TM layer and inducing and optimizing the O3-OP2 phase transition occurring in the voltage range of 2.0-4.3 V. Consequently, the cosubstituted NaLi1/9Ni1/3Mn4/9Ti1/9O2 exhibits an astounding capacity of 161.2 mAh g-1 in the voltage range of 2.0-4.3 V at 1C, and stable cycling up to 100 cycles has been achieved.

However, the electrochemical performance of sodium‐ion full cells (SIFCs) suffers severely from the irreversible consumption of sodium ions of cathode during the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation of hard carbon anode. Here, a high‐efficiency cathode sodiation compensation reagent, sodium oxalate (Na2C2O4), which possesses both a high theoretical capacity of 400 mA h g−1 and a capacity utilization as high as 99%, is proposed. The implementation of Na2C2O4 as sacrificial sodium species is successfully realized by decreasing its oxidation potential from 4.41 to 3.97 V through tuning conductive additives with different physicochemical features, and the corresponding mechanism of oxidation potential manipulation is analyzed. Electrochemical results show that in the full cell based on a hard carbon anode and a P2‐Na2/3Ni1/3Mn1/3Ti1/3O2 cathode with Na2C2O4 as a sodium reservoir to compensate for sodium loss during SEI formation, the capacity retention is increased from 63% to 85% after 200 cycles and the energy density is improved from 129.2 to 172.6 W h kg−1.

Therefore, it is quite necessary to reveal the underlying structural evolution mechanism and diffusion kinetics to improve the structural/electrochemical stability for application in SIBs. Here, we synthesize a P2 type Na0.78Al0.05Ni0.33Mn0.60O2 material by small dose of Al replacing the Mn, aiming at enhancing the structural stability without sacrificing the average discharge voltage and theoretical capacity. The etching XPS and EDX mapping/line scan results indicate that the Al doping induces the dual effects of the Al2O3 surface coating and the bulk lattice doping, which efficiently suppress the accumulation of structural irreversible changes from P2 to O2, the volume changes and surface reactions at high voltage. Obvious improvements are further found on the diffusion kinetics of Na ions as well as the decrease of overall voltage polarization. Interestingly, the dual effects of Al doping lead to the significant increase of capacity retention after 50 cycles and improvement of rate capability compared with the undoped counterpart between 2.0 - 4.5 V.

The most typical electrode materials (i.e., Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 (NVP), MoS2 , and TiO2 ) are anchored onto the 3DPGFs-NS matrix (denoted as NVP@C@3DPGFs-NS; MoS2 @C@3DPGFs-NS and TiO2 @C@3DPGFs-NS) to demonstrate its general process to boost the energy density of NIBs. The N, S co-doped porous graphene structure with a large surface area offers fast ionic transport within the electrode and facilitates efficient electron transport, and thus endows the 3DPGFs-NS-based composite electrodes with excellent sodium storage performance. The resulting NVP@C@3DPGFs-NS displays excellent electrochemical performance as both cathode and anode for NIBs.

        "abstract": "Superior sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) greatly need cathode materials with higher capacity and better durability. Herein, the anion group substitution strategy is proposed to design a cathode material with extraordinary Na+ storage performance, NASICON-Na4Fe3(PO4)1.9(SiO4)0.1P2O7 (NFPP-Si0.1). The experimental and theoretical research revealed that modification in the local structure by anion substitution significantly boosts the ionic/electronic transfer kinetics via optimizing the electronic conductivity and reducing the Na+ diffusion energy barrier. Furthermore, the SiO44- substitution generates a slight expansion of the crystal lattice to broaden the Na+ diffusion channel. Specifically, the custom-designed NFPP-Si0.1 could deliver a high rate capability of 77.6 mAh g-1 at constant 50 C charge-discharge and excellent recyclability of 79.4% retention rate after 7000 cycles at 10 C. Besides, it also possesses outstanding low temperature reversible capacity of 95.5 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C and long-term cyclability of 93.6% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 5 C in -10 °C. This strategy of heterogeneous and isostructural anion group substitution provides a method for unlocking high-rate and long-life-span mixed polyanionic cathodes.",

To address this issue, a medium‐entropy concept is proposed, and a novel medium‐entropy Na3Mn2/3V2/3Ti2/3(PO4)3/C@CNTs (ME‐NMVTP) cathode is designed. The as‐prepared ME‐NMVTP achieves a successive redox reaction, delivering a highly reversible specific capacity of 147.9 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 together with a long‐term lifespan of 1000 cycles at 500 mA g−1 (capacity retention of 88.3%), which is superior to low‐entropy cathodes such as Na4MnV(PO4)3/C@CNTs (LE‐NMVP) and Na3MnTi(PO4)3/C@CNTs (LE‐NMTP). Moreover, benefiting from the entropy effect, solid‐solution and biphasic reactions with reversible structure evolution and small volume change are achieved during the multi‐sodium storage process. First‐principles calculation and kinetic analysis results affirm the enhanced electronic conductivity and facilitated Na+ migration of the ME‐NMVTP cathode derived from the synergistic effect of the three transition‐metal elementals in a medium‐entropy crystalline state. The strategy of engineering medium‐entropy to construct cathodes with superior performance is expected to be widely applicable to other electrode materials.",

Herein, a high‐entropy substitution strategy, to alter the detailed crystal structure of NVPF without changing the central active V atom, is pioneeringly utilized, achieving simultaneous electronic conductivity enhancement and diffusion barrier reduction for Na+, according to theoretical calculations. The as‐prepared carbon‐free high‐entropy Na3V1.9(Ca,Mg,Al,Cr,Mn)0.1(PO4)2F3 (HE‐NVPF) cathode can deliver higher mean voltage of 3.81 V and more advantageous energy density up to 445.5 Wh kg−1, which is attributed by the diverse transition‐metal elemental substitution in high‐entropy crystalline. More importantly, high‐entropy introduction can help realize disordered rearrangement of Na+ at Na(2) active sites, thereby to refrain from unfavorable discharging behaviors at low‐voltage region, further lifting up the mean working voltage to realize a full Na‐ion storage at the high voltage plateau. Coupling with a hard carbon (HC) anode, HE‐NVPF//HC SIB full cells can deliver high specific energy density of 326.8 Wh kg−1 at 5 C with the power density of 2178.9 W kg−1.

Herein, NVP is successfully optimized by dual-doping K/Co and enwrapping carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through a sol-gel method. Naturally, the occupation of K and Co in the Na1 sites and V sites can efficiently stabilize the crystal cell and provide the expanded Na+ transport channels. The existence of tubular CNTs could restrict the crystal grain growth and effectively downsize the particle size and provide a shorter pathway for the migration of electrons and ions. Moreover, the amorphous carbon layers combined with the conductive CNTs form a favorable network for the accelerated electronic transportation. Furthermore, the ex situ XPS characterization reveals that an extra redox reaction pair of Co2+/Co3+ is successfully activated at the high voltage range, resulting in superior capacity and energy density property for KC0.05/CNTs composites. Comprehensively, the optimized KC0.05/CNTs electrode exhibits a distinctive electrochemical property. It delivers an initial reversible capacity of 119.4 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C, surpassing the theoretic value for the NVP system (117.6 mA h g-1).

Herein, a high-entropy substitution strategy is employed in NFPP to address these limitations. Ex situ X-ray diffraction analysis reveals a single-phase electrochemical reaction during the sodiation/desodiation processes and the increased configurational entropy in HE-NFPP endows an enhanced structure, which results in a minimal volume variation of only 1.83%.

A flexible NIC device based on the m-Nb2 O5 /CNF anode and the graphene framework (GF)/mesoporous carbon nanofiber (mCNF) cathode, is further constructed, and delivers an ultrahigh power density of 60 kW kg-1 at 55 Wh kg-1 (based on the total weight of m-Nb2 O5 /CNF and GF/mCNF). More importantly, owing to the free-standing flexible electrode configuration, the m-Nb2 O5 /CNF//GF/mCNF NIC exhibits high volumetric energy and power densities (11.2 mWh cm-3 , 5.4 W cm-3 ) based on the full device, which holds great promise in a wide variety of flexible electronics.",

        "title": "Metastable layered lithium-rich niobium and tantalum oxides via nearly instantaneous cation exchange.",
        "abstract": "Lithium-rich early transition metal oxides are the source of excess removeable lithium that affords high energy density to lithium-rich battery cathodes. They are also candidates for solid electrolytes in all-solid-state batteries. These highly ionic compounds are sparse on phase diagrams of thermodynamically stable oxides, but soft chemical routes offer an alternative to explore new alkali-rich crystal chemistries. In this work, a new layered polymorph of Li3NbO4 with coplanar [Nb4O16]12- clusters is discovered through ion exchange chemistry. A more detailed study of the ion exchange reaction reveals that it takes place almost instantaneously, changing the crystal volume by more than 22% within seconds. The transformation of coplanar [Nb4O16]12- in L-Li3NbO4 into the supertetrahedral [Nb4O16]12- clusters found in the stable cubic c-Li3NbO4 is also explored. Furthermore, this synthetic pathway is extended to access a new layered polymorph of Li3TaO4. NMR crystallography with 6,7Li, 23Na, and 93Nb NMR, X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, and first-principles calculations is applied to A3MO4 (A = Li, Na; M = Nb, Ta) to identify local and long-range atomic structure, to monitor the unusually rapid reaction progression, and to track the phase transitions from the metastable layered phases to the known compounds found using high-temperature synthesis. A mechanism is proposed whereby some sodium is retained at short reaction times, which then undergoes proton exchange during water washing, forming a phase with hydrogen bonds bridging the coplanar [Nb4O16]12- clusters. This study has implications for lithium-rich transition metal oxides and associated battery materials and for ion exchange chemistry in non-framework structures. The role of techniques that can detect light elements, local structure, and subtle structural changes in soft-chemical synthesis is emphasized.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) hold great promise owing to the naturally abundant sodium resource and high safety. The research focus of SIBs is usually directed toward electrode materials, while the binder as an important component is rarely investigated. Herein, a cross-linked sodium alginate (SA)/graphene oxide (GO) binder is judiciously designed to serve as a robust artificial interphase on the surface of both anode and cathode of SIBs. Benefiting from the cross-linking continuous network structure as well as the highly hydrophilic nature, the SA-GO binder possesses a large tensile strength of 197.7 Mpa and a high ionic conductivity of 0.136 mS cm-1 , superior to pure SA (93.8 Mpa, 0.025 mS cm-1 ). Moreover, the structural design of SA-GO binder exhibits a strong binding ability to guarantee structural integrity during cycling. To demonstrate its effectiveness, polyanion-type phosphates (e.g., Na3 (VO)2 (PO4 )2 F) and chalcogenides (e.g., MoS2 , VS2 ) are adopted as cathode and anode materials of SIBs, respectively. As compared to traditional binders (e.g., PVDF, SA), electrodes with the SA-GO binder exhibits significantly increased rate capability and cycling stability, such as Na3 (VO)2 (PO4 )2 F (40 C fast-charge, 84% capacity retention after 1000 cycles). This work highlights the role of novel aqueous-based binders in developing next-generation sodium-storage devices.",

Herein, an effective strategy of polymorph engineering is proposed to boost the volumetric capacity of FeSe. Owing to the inherent metallic electronic conductivity of tetragonal‐FeSe, a conductive additive‐free electrode (hereafter denoted as CA‐free) can be assembled with an enhanced sodium storage volumetric capacity of 1011 mAh cm−3, significantly higher than semiconducting hexagonal‐FeSe. Impressively, the CA‐free electrode can achieve an extremely high active material utilization of 96.7 wt% and high initial Coulombic efficiency of 96%, superior to most of the anodes for Na‐ion storage. Moreover, the design methodology is branched out using tetragonal FeSe as the cathode for Li‐ion batteries. The CA‐free tetragonal‐FeSe electrode can achieve a high volumetric energy density of 1373 Wh L−1 and power density of 7200 W L−1, outperforming most metal chalcogenides. Reversible conversion reactions are revealed by in situ XRD for both sodium and lithium systems.

        "abstract": "Porous carbon has been widely used as an efficient host to encapsulate highly active molecular sulfur (S) in Li–S and Na–S batteries. However, for these sub‐nanosized pores, it is a challenge to provide fully accessible sodium ions with unobstructed channels during cycling, particularly for high sulfur content. It is well recognized that solid interphase with full coverage over the designed architectures plays critical roles in promoting rapid charge transfer and stable conversion reactions in batteries, whereas constructing a high‐ionic‐conductivity solid interphase in the pores is very difficult. Herein, unique continuous carbonaceous pores are tailored, which can serve as multifunctional channels to encapsulate highly active S and provide fully accessible pathways for sodium ions. Solid sodium sulfide interphase layers are also realized in the channels, showing high Na‐ion conductivity toward stabilizing the redox kinetics of the S cathode during charge/discharge processes. This systematically designed carbon‐hosted sulfur cathode delivers superior cycling performance (420 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 after 2000 cycles), high capacity retention of ≈90% over 500 cycles at current density of 0.5 A g−1, and outstanding rate capability (470 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1) for room‐temperature sodium–sulfur batteries.",

        "abstract": "Titanium-based polyanions have been intensively investigated for sodium-ion batteries due to their superior structural stability and thermal safety. However, their low working potentials hindered the further applications. Here, we introduce a cation and anion dual doping strategy to boost the redox potential of Ti-based cathodes of Na 3 Ti 0.5 V 0.5 (PO 3 ) 3 N as a new cathode material for sodium ion batteries. Both the Ti 3+ /Ti 4+ and V 3+ /V 4+ redox couples are reversibly accessed, leading to two distinctive voltage platforms at ~ 3.8 V and ~3.3 V, respectively. The remarkably improved cycling stability (86.3%, 3000 cycles) can be ascribed to the near-zero volume strain in this unusual cubic symmetry, which has been demonstrated by the in-situ synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction. First-principles calculations reveal its well-interconnected three-dimensional Na diffusion pathways with low energy barriers, and the two-sodium-extracted intermediate NaTi 0.5 V 0.5 (PO 3 ) 3 N is also a stable phase according to the formation energy calculations. The nitridophosphate family will provide insights for the development of high-energy sodium batteries, with breakthroughs on wide-voltage-window solid-solid electrolytes expected in the near future.",

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are considered one of the most promising alternatives for large-scale energy storage due largely to the abundance and low cost of sodium. However, the lack of high-performance cathode materials at low cost represents a major obstacle toward broad commercialization of SIB technology. In this work, we report a green route strategy that allows cost-effective fabrication of carbon-coated Na2FePO4F cathode for SIBs. By using vitamin C as a green organic carbon source and environmentally friendly water-based polyacrylic latex as the binder, we have demonstrated that the Na2FePO4F phase in the as-derived Na2FePO4F/C electrode shows a high reversible capacity of 117 mAh g-1 at a cycling rate of 0.1 C. More attractively, excellent rate capability is achieved while retaining outstanding cycling stability (∼85% capacity retention after 1000 charge-discharge cycles at a rate of 4 C). Further, in operando X-ray diffraction has been used to probe the evolution of phase structures during the charge-discharge process, confirming the structural robustness of the Na2FePO4F/C cathode (even when charged to 4.5 V). Accordingly, the poor initial Coulombic efficiency of some anode materials may be compensated by extracting more sodium ions from Na2FePO4F/C cathode at higher potentials (up to 4.5 V).",

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)2F3 is recognized as a promising cathode for high energy density sodium-ion batteries due to its high average potential of ∼3.95 V (vs Na/Na+). A high-voltage-resistant electrolyte is of high importance due to the long duration of 4.2 V (vs Na/Na+) when improving cyclability. Herein, a targeted electrolyte containing additives with two -C≡N groups like succinonitrile has been designed. In this design, one -C≡N group is accessible to the solvation sheath and enables the other -C≡N in dinitrile being exposed and subsequently squeezed into the electric double layer. Then, the squeezed -C≡N group is prone to a preferential adsorption on the electrode surface prior to the exposed -CH2/-CH3 in Na+-solvent and oxidized to construct a stable and electrically insulating interface enriched CN-/NCO-/Na3N. The Na3V2(PO4)2F3-based sodium-ion batteries within a high-voltage of 2-4.3 V (vs Na/Na+) can accordingly achieve an excellent cycling stability (e.g., 95.07% reversible capacity at 1 C for 1,5-dicyanopentane and 98.4% at 2 C and 93.0% reversible capacity at 5 C for succinonitrile after 1000 cycles).

When used for the cathode of rechargeable sodium‐ion batteries, the ultrathin iodinene exhibits superb rate properties with a high specific capacity of 109.5 mA h g−1 at the high rate of 10 A g−1 owing to its unique 2D ultrathin architecture with remarkably enhanced pseudocapacitive behavior.

To overcome these weaknesses, layer-tunnel hybrid material was developed and served as the cathode of SIB, which integrated high capacity, superior cycle ability, and rate performance. In the current work, the doping of copper was adopted to suppress the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn3+ and to affect relevant structural parameters. Multifunctions of the Cu2+ doping were carefully investigated. It was found that the structure component ratio is varied with the Cu2+ doping amount. Results demonstrated that Na+/vacancy rearrangement and phase transitions were suppressed during cycling without sacrificing the reversible capacity and enhanced electrochemical performances evidenced with 96 mA h g-1 retained after 250 cycles at 4 C and 85 mA h g-1 at 8 C. Furthermore, ex situ X-ray diffraction has demonstrated high reversibility of the Na0.6Mn0.9Cu0.1O2 cathode during Na+ extraction/insertion processes and superior air stability that results in better storage properties. This study reveals that the Cu2+ doping could be an effective strategy to tune the properties and related performances of Mn-based layer-tunnel hybrid cathode.",

        "abstract": "Although bismuth-based anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted wide attention, their large volume variation hinders their actual applications, especially in Bi2Te3 systems. In this study, Bi2Te3 nanosheets (BT-Ns) are fabricated by a novel strategy via a solvent reductive reaction. The elements Bi and Te are spontaneously grown into ultrathin nanosheets because the hexagonal crystal of Bi2Te3 has a strong tendency to grow horizontally. The crystal structure of the BT-Ns is well developed and the thickness is about 1.42 nm, which can not only offer more active sites but also promote electrical conductivity and the diffusion of Na ions and electrons. It exhibits excellent rate and long-term cyclic performance, delivering 364.0 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1 after 1200 cycles. The high rate and long-term cyclic performance of the Bi2Te3 anodes is attributed to the facile design of the 2D nanosheet structure, presenting an effective strategy to construct anodes for SIBs. The sodium storage mechanism of Bi2Te3 follows a three-step crystallographic phase change of Bi2Te3, discovered by an in situ X-ray diffraction analysis. The applicability of BT-N anodes in full cells via pairing with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathodes delivers excellent performance (energy density of 107.2 W h kg-1) and satisfactory practical applied prospects.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have attracted tremendous attention due to its much lower cost and similar working principle compared with lithium-ion batteries, which have been placed great expectation as energy storage devices in grid-level applications. Sodium superionic conductor structured Na3V2(PO4)3 has been considered as a promising cathode candidate while its intrinsic low electronic conductivity results in poor rate performance and unsatisfactory cycling performance, which severely impedes its potential for practical applications. Herein, we developed a facile one-pot strategy to construct dual carbon protected hybrid structure composed of carbon coated Na3V2(PO4)3 nanoparticles embedded with carbon matrix with excellent rate performance, superior cycling stability and ultralong lifespan. Specifically, it can deliver an outstanding rate performance with a 51.5% capacity retention from 0.5 to 100 C and extraordinary cycling stability of 80.86% capacity retention after 6000 cycles at the high rate of 20 C. The possible reasons for the enhanced performance could be understood as the synergistic effects of the strengthened structural robust, facilitated charge transfer kinetics and mesoporous feature of the Na3V2(PO4)3 hybrid structure. This work provides a cost-effective strategy to effectively optimize electrochemical performance of Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, which could contribute to push forward the advance of its practical applications.",

The elimination of diffusion effects in electrochemical measurements enables the assessment of interaction energies from simple cyclic voltammetry experiments through the theoretical work of Laviron and Tokuda. In this work, the two N-substituted perylenes, N,N′-dimethyl-3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (Me2PTCDI) and N,N′-diphenyl-3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (Ph2PTCDI), as well as the parent molecule 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (H2PTCDI) are investigated as thin-film composite electrodes on carbon fibers for sodium-ion batteries. The composite electrodes are analyzed with Raman spectroscopy. Interaction parameters are extracted from cyclic voltammetry measurements. The stability and rate capability of the three PTCDI derivatives are examined through galvanostatic measurements in sodium-ion half-cell batteries and the influence of the interactions on those parameters is evaluated. In addition, self-consistent charge density function tight binding calculations of the different PTCDI systems interacting with graphite have been carried out. The results show that the binding motif displays notable deviations from an ideal ABA stacking, especially for the neutral state. In addition, data obtained for the electron-transfer integrals show that the difference in performance between different PTCDI thin-film batteries cannot be solely explained by the electron-transfer properties and other factors such as H-bonding have to be considered.",

        "abstract": "The stable storage of sodium ions always presents some difficulties for sodium-based dual-ion batteries (S-DIBs), such as the irreversibility of guest-storage and kinetic hindrance in the anode. Based on the low strain volume and stable phase structure, herein, lithium titanate (LTO, Li4Ti5O12) was developed to store sodium ions between the working potential (∼0.8 V), which expands the lower plateau over than that of lithium ion storage (∼1.55 V) to obtain a high energy density of full batteries. The spinel lithium titanate shows negligible volume change and extremely stable structure under Na+-storage, which completely overcomes the shortage problems of the Na+-host. Additionally, by the detection of the transfer state of anions and cations in dual-ion batteries, the diffusion coefficient of the sodium ion in the LTO electrode is higher than that of the cathode, which shows that the transport process of sodium ions can meet the kinetic demands of full batteries. Such S-DIBs exhibit a large working voltage of 2.0–4.6 V and stable electrochemical performance over 1280 cycles, which is superior to conventional sodium-based systems, and further exhibit many advantages such as high energy density, environmental friendliness, and low cost.",

        "abstract": "Layered transition metal oxide (NaxTMO2), being one of the most promising cathode candidates for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), have attracted intensive interest because of their nontoxicity, high theoretical capacities, and easy manufacturability. However, their physical and electrochemical properties of water sensitivity, sluggish Na+ transport kinetics, and irreversible multiple‐phase translations hinder the practical application. Here, a concept of surface lattice‐matched engineering is proposed based on in situ spinel interfacial reconstruction to design a spinel coating P2/P3 heterostructure cathode material with enhanced air stability, rate, and cycle performance. The novel structure and its formation process are verified by transmission electron microscopy and in situ high‐temperature X‐ray diffraction. The electrode exhibits an excellent rate performance with the highly reversible phase transformation demonstrated by in situ charging/discharging X‐ray diffraction. Additionally, even after a rigorous water sensitivity test, the electrode materials still retain almost the same superior electrochemical performance as the fresh sample. The results show that the surface spinel phase can play a vital role in preventing the ingress of water molecules, improving transport kinetics, and enhancing structural integrity for NaxTMO2 cathodes. The concept of surface lattice‐matched engineering based on in situ spinel interfacial reconstruction will be helpful for designing new ultra‐stable cathode materials for high‐performance SIBs.",

Herein, we develop an efficient method to fabricate in situ carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)2F3 nanosheets by using cost-effective amylopectin. The amylopectin not only could induce the nucleation of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 along its backbone to form a 2D nanostructure, but also act as a source of amorphous carbon for in situ coating on the active material surface. The composite exhibits extraordinary rate capability (104 mA h g-1 at 40 C, 51 mA h g-1 at 150 C) and desirable cycling stability. Such satisfactory achievements, especially the superior rate performance, should be ascribed to its unique 2D nanostructure which shortens the Na+ diffusion length, and the in situ carbon coating endows the composites with effective electron transport.

This unique hexagonal nanosheet structure offers abundant active sites and contact area to the electrolyte, which could shorten the Na+ diffusion path. The heterostructured N-doping carbon improves the electrochemical conductivity and accelerates the kinetics of Na+ transportation. Electrochemical analysis shows that the charge-discharge process is controlled by the pseudocapacitive behavior thus leading to high-rate capability and long lifespan in half batteries.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have shown great superiority for grid-scale storage applications because of their low cost and the abundance of sodium. P2-type Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 cathode materials have attracted much attention for their high capacities and operating voltages as well as their simple synthesis processes. However, Na+/vacancy ordering and the P2-O2 phase transition are unavoidable during Na+ insertion/extraction, leading to undesired voltage plateaus and deficient battery performances. We show that this defect can be effectually eliminated by coating a moderate Na+ conductor Na2Ti3O7 with a smart in situ coating approach and a concomitant doping of Ti4+ into the bulk structure. Based on the combined analysis of ex situ X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, electrochemical performance tests, and electrochemical kinetic analyses, Na2Ti3O7 coating and Ti4+ doping effectively refrain Na+/vacancy ordering and P2-O2 phase transition during cycling. Additionally, the Na2Ti3O7 coating layer suppresses particle exfoliation and accelerates Na+ diffusion at the cathode and electrolyte interface. Hence, Na2Ti3O7-coated Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 exhibits excellent cycling stability (almost no capacity decay after 200 cycles at 5 C) and outstanding rate capability (31.1% of the initial capacity at a high rate of 5 C compared to only 10.4% for the pristine electrode). This coating strategy can provide a new guide for the design of prominent cathode materials for SIBs that are suitable for practical applications.",

        "abstract": "Mn-rich P2-type layered oxide cathode materials suffer from severe capacity loss caused by detrimental phase transition and transition metal dissolution, making their implementation difficult in large-scale sodium-ion battery applications. Herein, we introduced a high-valent Sb5+ substitution, leading to a biphasic P2/O3 cathode that suppresses the P2-O2 phase transformation in the high-voltage condition attributed to the stronger Sb-O covalency that introduces extra electrons to the O atom, reducing oxygen loss from the lattices and improving structural stability, as confirmed by first-principle calculations. Besides, the enhanced Na+ diffusion kinetics and thermodynamics in the modified sample are associated with the enlarged lattice parameters. As a result, the proposed cathode delivers a discharge capacity of 142.6 mAh g-1 at 0.1C between 1.5 and 4.3 V and excellent performance at a high mass loading of 8 mg cm3 with a specific capacity of 131 mAh g-1 at 0.2C. Furthermore, it also possesses remarkable rate capability (90.3 mAh g-1 at 5C), specifying its practicality in high-energy-density sodium-ion batteries. Hence, this work provides insights into incorporating high-valent dopants for high-performance Mn-rich cathodes.",

        "abstract": "The fabrication and design of electrodes that transfer more energy at high rates is very crucial for battery technology because of the increasing need for electrical energy storage. Usually, reducing a material's volume expansion and improving its electrical conductivity can promote electron and Li+/Na+ ion transfer in nanostructured electrodes and improve rate capability and stability. Here, we demonstrate a general metal- Aspergillus niger bioleaching approach for preparing novel fungus-inspired electrode materials that may enable high-performance lithium ion/sodium ion batteries with one-dimensional architectures. The fungus functions as a natural template to provide large amounts of nitrogen/carbon sources, which are functionalized with metal sulfide nanoparticles, yielding various metal sulfide nanoparticles/nitrogen-doped carbonaceous fibers (MS/NCF (MS = ZnS, Co9S8, FeS, Cu1.81S)) with high conductivity. In addition, the as-obtained MS/NCF has a uniform fiber architecture and abundant porous structure, which can also enhance the storage ability for LIBs and SIBs. Taking ZnS/NCF as an example, the material exhibits a high specific capacity of up to 715.5 mAh g-1 (100 cycles) and 455 mAh g-1 (50 cycles) at 0.1 A g-1 for LIBs and SIBs, respectively. This versatile approach for employing a fungus as a sustainable template to form high-performance electrodes may provide a systematic platform for implementing advanced battery designs.",

        "abstract": "Reliable operation of Na‐ion batteries requires a mastering of the interfacial processes governing intercalation kinetics. Ion desolvation, amongst others, is a crucial phenomenon as far as power applications are envisioned. Studying the intricacies of interfacial processes faces experimental challenges. Here the complementary use of electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) and operando infrared fiber evanescent wave spectroscopy (IR‐FEWS) combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is reported to investigate the electrode/electrolyte interface of polyanionic Na‐insertion compounds Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) and Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF). Through screening of various electrolytes that differ in their solvation energy and viscosity, the existence of an unusual mass uptake/depletion signal is demonstrated at the NVP interfaces only, indicative of a dissimilarity in migration kinetics of solvent molecules between NVP and NVPF interfaces as supported by IR‐FEWS. This finding is rationalized by positing that sodium depletion is caused by the unusually rapid ion diffusion within NVP mediated by an intermediate metastable phase, which leads to opposite Na+ concentration and free solvent molecule gradients at the interface that causes the unusual and anomalous feature observed on EQCM frequency profiles. This feature does not appear with NVPF showing lower ionic diffusion. Altogether, this fundamental study provides valuable fundamental insights into the interface structuring of insertion compounds depending upon their Na+ mobility.",

Electrolytes containing 1,1,2,2-tetramethoxyethane (tetramethoxyglyoxal, TMG), 1,1,2,2-tetraethoxyethane (tetraethoxyglyoxal, TEG) and a mixture of the latter with propylene carbonate (PC) exhibit increased thermal stabilities and higher flash points compared to classical electrolytes based on carbonates as solvents. Due to its favorable properties, 1 M NaTFSI in TEG:PC (3:7), has been selected and used for sodium-ion energy storage systems based on a Prussian Blue (PB) positive electrode and a hard carbon negative electrode. Compared to conventional electrolyte (based on a 1:1 mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC)), this glyoxylic-acetal electrolyte provides competitive capacity and prolonged cycle life. Post mortem XPS analysis indicates that the electrode-electrolyte interphases formed in presence of TEG are thicker and presumably more protective, inhibiting typical degradation processes of the electrodes. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the suitable properties of TEG on the cycling stability can also be exploited for the construction of highly stable sodium-ion capacitors.",

        "abstract": "Advancing electrochemical energy storage devices relies on versatile analytical tools capable of revealing the molecular mechanisms behind the function and degradation of battery materials in situ. The nuclear magnetic resonance phenomenon plays a pivotal role in fundamental studies of energy materials and devices because of its exceptional sensitivity to local environments and the dynamics of many electrochemically relevant elements. The jelly roll architecture is one of the most energy-dense and, therefore, most popular concepts implemented in pouch, prismatic, and cylindrical Li- and Na-ion cells. Such widely commercialized designs, however, represent a significant obstacle for a range of powerful in situ magnetic resonance-based methodologies due to negligible radio frequency electromagnetic field penetration through conductive metal casings and current collectors. In this work, we introduce an experimental setup that enables direct RF wave transmission through the cell terminals and current collectors, and provides efficient excitation and detection of NMR signals. An RF adapter designed as a plug-and-play device effectively turns the battery cell into an NMR probe that can be tuned to a broad range of Larmor frequencies. Due to its exceptional sensitivity, versatility, and multinuclear capability, the proposed methodology is suitable for fundamental research and industrial high-throughput screening applications. In situ NMR lineshapes provide a direct quantitative description of the chemical environments of electrochemically active elements and enable new metrics for the accurate assessment of state-of-charge (SoC) and state-of-health (SoH). Specifically, in commercial pouch cells based on lithium cobalt oxide, lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide, and sodium nickel iron manganese oxide chemistries, 7Li and 23Na NMR data unambiguously show electrochemical transformations between intercalated and metallic forms of charge carrier ions, and reveal anisotropic magnetic properties of the electrode coating.",

However, such a unique solvation structure inevitably injures the ionic conductivity of electrolytes and limits the fast-charging performance. Herein, a trade-off in tuning anion-reinforced solvation structure and high ionic conductivity is realized by the entropy-assisted hybrid ester-ether electrolyte. Anion-reinforced solvation sheath with more anions occupying the inner Na+ shell is constructed by introducing the weakly coordinated ether tetrahydrofuran into the commonly used ester-based electrolyte, which merits the accelerated desolvation energy and gradient inorganic-rich electrode-electrolyte interface. The improved ionic conductivity is attributed to the weakly diverse solvation structures induced by entropy effect. These enable the enhanced rate performance and cycling stability of Prussian blue||hard carbon full cells with high electrode mass loading. More importantly, the practical application of the designed electrolyte was further demonstrated by industry-level 18650 cylindrical cells.",

Pure orthorhombic single-phase powders were prepared under air, using an autocombustion synthesis method. They crystallize in the orthorhombic Imma space group with similar unit cell parameters [a = 10.1592(2), b = 13.0321(3), c = 6.4864(2) Å] and [a = 10.3993(1), b = 13.1966(1), c = 6.4955(1) Å] for β-Na2Ni2M(PO4)3 (NNAP) and β-Na2Ni2Fe(PO4)3 (NNFP), respectively. Crystal structures of both compounds were determined using X-ray powder diffraction and Rietveld method refinements, which indicate the occurrence of Ni2+ in the 8g site, and of M3+ in the 4a site of the structure. The structure consists of a three-dimensional anionic framework obtained by the association on MO6, NiO6, and PO4 polyhedra, sharing edges and corners. The resulting three-dimensional structure creates monodimensional channels along the [100] and [010] directions formed by face-shared oxygen polyhedra and occupied by Na+ cations. This nondisordered cationic distribution is confirmed by a significant change of magnetic properties. Thus, both NNAP and NNFP samples show paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition at 14 and 19 K, respectively. For the two compounds, thermal stability, electrical conductivity, and electrochemical properties have been also investigated. The intercalation/desintercalation properties of NNMP compounds as positive electrode were tested in sodium-ion batteries.

Importantly, an anion-derived passivation film is formed via preferential reduction of the anion upon charging, which can effectively suppress further electrolyte reduction. As a structural characteristic of the electrolyte, most anions are coordinated to multiple Na+ cations at high concentration, which shifts the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of the anions downward, resulting in preferential anion reduction.

Herein, first-principles calculations are used to determine the properties, including the electronic, mechanical and ionic transport properties, of Na3PS4 sulfide solid electrolytes doped with low and high Ca ion concentrations. Our theoretical results demonstrate that low Ca ion concentrations can be easily doped in tetragonal and cubic phases (t-Na3PS4 and c-Na3PS4) and create a suitable number of Na vacancies based on the formation energy analysis. Furthermore, the calculated density of states and charge density differences indicate that the surrounding electronic environment is changed, and Ca-S ionic bonds are formed in Na3PS4 with Ca-doping. In addition, the improved ductility and mechanical strength of c-Na3PS4 and t-Na3PS4 achieved by low-concentration Ca doping may help suppress dendritic growth and electrode deformation. Finally, sodium ion migration in Ca-doped Na3PS4 is described with the aid of the CI-NEB method, and it is found that the migration energy barriers are less than those of pure Na3PS4, which suggests that the sodium ion conductivity can be effectively improved by doping with low Ca2+ concentrations.

Transition metal selenides present excellent conductivity and high capacity, nevertheless their low conductivity and serious volume expansion raise challenging issues of inferior lifespan and capacity fading.

        "abstract": "Sodium ion (Na+)-based electrochemical systems have been extensively investigated in batteries and supercapacitors and also can be quality candidates for electrochromic (EC) devices. However, poor diffusion kinetics and severe EC performance degradation occur during the intercalation/deintercalation processes because the ionic radii of Na+ are larger than those of conventional intercalation ions. Here, through intentional design of ion-transport channels in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), Na+ serves as an efficient intercalation ion for incorporation into a nanostructured electrode with a high diffusion coefficient of approximately 10-8 cm2 s-1. As a result, the well-designed MOF-based EC device demonstrates desirable Na+ EC performance, including fast switching speed, multicolor switching, and high stability. A smart \"quick response code\" display is fabricated using a mask-free laser writing method for application in the \"Internet of Things\". In addition, the concept of ion transport pathway design can be widely adopted for fabricating high-performance ion intercalation materials and devices for consumer electronics.",

        "abstract": "The chemical environments of the interlayer Na sites of layered titanate are finely controlled by the intercalation of n-alkylamine with various alkyl chain lengths to explore an effective way to improve its electrode functionality for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The n-alkylamine intercalation via ion-exchange and exfoliation-restacking routes allows the modification of in-plane structures of layered titanate to be tuned. Among the present n-alkylamine-intercalates, the n-pentylamine-intercalated titanate shows the largest discharge capacity with the best rate characteristics, underscoring the critical role of optimized intracrystalline structure in improving the SIB electrode performance of layered titanate. The creation of turbostratic in-plane structure degrades the SIB electrode performance of layered titanate, indicating the detrimental effect of in-plane structural disorder on electrode activity. 23Na magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrates that the n-alkylamine-intercalated titanates possess two different interlayer Na+ sites near ammonium head groups/titanate layers and near alkyl chains. The intercalation of long-chain molecules increases the population of the latter site and the overall mobility of Na+ ions, which is responsible for the improvement of electrode activity upon n-alkylamine intercalation. The present study highlights that the increased population of interlayer metal sites remote from the host layers is effective in improving the electrode functionality of layered metal oxide for SIBs and multivalent ion batteries.",

Based on the eutectic composition of the NaFSA–KFSA (56:44 mol/mol) binary system, the superconcentrated solutions of 35 mol kg–1 Na0.55K0.45FSA/H2O and 33 mol kg–1 Na0.45K0.55FSA/H2O are found to form at 25 °C. As both electrolytes demonstrate a wider potential window of ∼3.5 V compared to that of either saturated 20 mol kg–1 NaFSA or 31 mol kg–1 KFSA solution, we applied the 33 mol kg–1 Na0.45K0.55FSA/H2O to two different battery configurations, carbon-coated Na2Ti2(PO4)3∥K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] and carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3∥K2Mn[Fe(CN)6]. The former cell shows highly reversible charge/discharge curves with a mean discharge voltage of 1.4 V. Although the latter cell exhibits capacity degradation, it demonstrates 2 V-class operations. Analysis data of the two cells confirmed that Na+ ions were mainly inserted into the negative electrodes passivated by a Na-rich solid electrolyte interphase, and both Na+ and K+ ions were inserted into the positive electrode. Based upon the observation, we propose new sodium-/potassium-ion batteries using the superconcentrated NaFSA–KFSA aqueous electrolytes.",

        "abstract": "Aqueous electrolytes can be used for electrical double-layer capacitors, pseudocapacitors, and intercalation-type batteries. These technologies may employ different electrode materials, most importantly high-surface-area nanoporous carbon, two-dimensional materials, and metal oxides. All of these materials also find more and more applications in electrochemical desalination devices. During the electrochemical operation of such electrode materials, charge storage and ion immobilization are accomplished by non-Faradaic ion electrosorption, Faradaic ion intercalation at specific crystallographic sites, or ion insertion between layers of two-dimensional materials. These processes may or may not be associated with a (partial) loss of the aqueous solvation shell around the ions. Our work showcases the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance as an excellent tool for quantifying the change in effective solvation. We chose sodium as an important cation for energy storage materials (sodium-based aqueous electrolytes) and electrochemical desalination (saline media). Our data show that a major amount of water uptake occurs during ion electrosorption in nanoporous carbon, while battery-like ion insertion between layers of titanium disulfide is associated with an 80% loss of the initially present solvation molecules. Sodiation of MXene is accomplished by a loss of 90% of the number of solvent molecules, but nanoconfined water in-between the MXene layers may compensate for this large degree of desolvation. In the case of sodium manganese oxide, we were able to demonstrate the full loss of the solvation shell.",

With electric current passing through, sodium and chloride ions are released or absorbed by two aerogel electrodes. This system achieves super high desalination capacity, excellent cycling stability, and rapid desalination rate. The desalination capacity is as high as 107.5 mg g-1 after 50 cycles with the current density of 100 mA g-1 . The outstanding desalination performance of this system shows a synergistic effect of combining battery materials with graphene for deionization and promises a new potential alternative of future desalination design.",

The stored iodine within the pores interacts with free iodide ions present in the bulk electrolyte via comproportionation reactions leading to polyiodide (I3 − and I5 −) formations. By tuning the mass asymmetry of carbon electrodes in hybrid cells and using the in‐situ Raman spectroscopy on positive battery electrode, we show the influence of iodine/polyiodides equilibrium shifts on the self‐discharge and voltage rebounds during open circuit conditions.

Synthesizing L-TiO2 functional materials for high-capacity and long cyclability battery remains challenging due to the unstable and poor conductivity of bare L-TiO2 . In nature, plant growth can stabilize land by preventing sands from dispersing following desertification. Inspired by nature's \"sand-fixation model,\" Al3+ \"seeds\" are in situ grown on layered Ti3 C2 Tx \"land.\" Subsequently, NH2 -MIL-101(Al) \"plants\" with Al as metal nodes are grown on the Ti3 C2 Tx \"land\" by self-assembly. After annealing and etching processes (similar to desertification), NH2 -MIL-101(Al) is transformed into interconnected N/O-doped carbon (MOF-NOC), which not only acts as a plant-like function to prevent the pulverization of L-TiO2 transformed from Ti3 C2 Tx but also improves the conductivity and stability of MOF-NOC@L-TiO2 . Al species are selected as seeds to improve interfacial compatibility and form intimate interface heterojunction. Systematic ex situ analysis discloses that the ions storage mechanism can be endowed by mixed contribution of non-Faradaic and Faradaic capacitance. Consequently, the MOF-NOC@L-TiO2 electrodes exhibit high interfacial capacitive charge storage and outstanding cycling performance. The interface engineering strategy inspired by \"sand-fixation model\" provides a reference for designing stable layered composites.",

We show that p-doping can drastically increase the binding strength to Li or Na and is therefore an effective strategy to design organic electrode materials for both lithium and sodium ion batteries. It could also be used to increase the theoretical capacity. On the other hand, n-doping generally has a much smaller effect on the voltage.

        "abstract": "Compared with the extensively used ester‐based electrolyte, the hard carbon (HC) electrode is more compatible with the ether‐based counterpart in sodium‐ion batteries, which can lead to improved cycling stability and robust rate capability. However, the impact of salt anion on the electrochemical performance of HC electrodes has yet to be fully understood. In this study, the anionic chemistry in regulating the stability of electrolytes and the performance of sodium‐ion batteries have been systematically investigated. This work shows discrepancies in the reductive stability of the anionic group, redox kinetics, and component/structure of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) with different salts (NaBF4, NaPF6, and NaSO3CF3) in the typical ether solvent (diglyme). Particularly, the density functional theory calculation manifests the preferred decomposition of PF6− due to the reduced reductive stability of anions in the solvation structure, thus leading to the formation of NaF‐rich SEI. Further investigation on redox kinetics reveals that the NaPF6/diglyme can induce the fast ionic diffusion dynamic and low charge transfer barrier for HC electrode, thus resulting in superior sodium storage performance in terms of rate capability and cycling life, which outperforms those of NaBF4/diglyme and NaSO3CF3/diglyme.

The remarkable improvement of surface quality shows a higher first cycle Coulombic efficiency (≈95%), a significantly enhanced cycling performance, and a better rate capability in electrochemical measurements. A combined study of Raman spectroscopy and inductive coupled plasma emission spectroscopy reveals that the evolution of Li4Ti5O12 surface in a water‐based hydrothermal environment is a hydrolysis–recrystallization process, which can introduce a new phase of anatase‐TiO2. While, with a small amount of Na2S (0.004 mol L−1 at least), the spinel‐Li4Ti5O12 phase is maintained without a second phase. During this process, the alkaline environment created by Na2S and the surface adsorption of the sulfur‐containing group (HS− or S2−) can suppress the recrystallization of anatase‐TiO2 and renew the particle surfaces. This finding gives a better understanding of the surface–property relationship on Li4Ti5O12 and guidance on preparation and modification of electrode material other than coating or doping.",

While this demand is currently being met through the use of lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), alternative batteries like sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) and solid‐state batteries (SSBs) are emerging as relevant alternatives. In this study, we analyze, based on current electric vehicle electrode stack designs, the environmental impact of LIB cells, SIB cells, and SSB cells. The life cycle assessment results from this cradle‐to‐gate study show that for LIB cell production today, ∼58–92 kgCO2‐eq are emitted per kWhcell and ∼296–624 kWhCED/kWhcell of primary energy is required. In SIB cell production, ∼75–87 kgCO2‐eq/kWhcell is emitted, and in SSB cell production, ∼88–130 kgCO2‐eq/kWhcell, depending on their specific electrode stack configuration. The results demonstrate that LFP (lithium–iron–phosphate) cells require the least energy for production across all battery types under analysis. Furthermore, the findings indicate that, in terms of global warming potential (GWP), LFP and NMC900 (nickel–manganese–cobalt) cells are the most sustainable battery types, at least when focusing solely on battery cell production and neglecting subsequent use phases. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that by optimizing the cell designs and their production, the environmental impact of battery cell production can be reduced in the short term by up to −38%. This allows the production of LFP battery cells with a low GWP of ∼37 kgCO2‐eq/kWhcell and NMC900 cells with ∼44 kgCO2‐eq/kWhcell. Moreover, there is considerable room for improvement in other major LIB cell types. This article met the requirements for a gold‐gold JIE data openness badge described at http://jie.click/badges.",

        "abstract": "Developing super-foldable electronic materials and devices presents a significant challenge, as intrinsic conductive materials are unable to achieve numerous true-folding operations (super-foldable) due to limitations from short-range forces of chemical bonds. Consequently, super-foldable batteries remain unexplored. This work focused on sodium-ion batteries as a breakthrough point to advance super-foldable devices. By employing a \"2+1\" bioinspired strategy, we stepwise designed and assembled super-foldable components, from substrates to electrodes, and to ultimately device. This bioinspired approach completely disperses folding stress and thus prevents the breakage of chemical bonds, enabling the successful fabrication of the first super-foldable ion battery. This battery can withstand true-folding at any angle, in any direction, and for an unprecedented number of cycles-far outperforming current foldable phones with hinge structures. Remarkably, after 500,000 true-folding cycles, the battery's microstructure remains intact with no significant degradation of electrochemical performance. Real-time dynamic folding observations reveal an M-shaped folding structure within the bioinspired materials, which effectively disperses stress via bulged layers, dispersed arcs, and slidable microgrooves that work together across different directions and dimensions to achieve super-foldability. Mechanical simulations vividly verify this principle. This work represents a breakthrough in super-foldable devices, offering valuable insights and promoting practical application for future super-foldable devices.",

        "abstract": "Herein, we detail an approach to accelerate the computational screening of materials for properties dictated by the kinetics of solid state diffusion through reliably and rapidly identifying upper and lower bounds to the transition state (TS) energy through our proposed modified single iteration synchronous-transit (MSIST) approach. While this sacrifices providing detailed information of the explicit TS structure, it requires only ~30% of the force evaluations of a full nudged elastic band (NEB) TS search and reduces the computational demand to compute estimated diffusion barriers by 70% on average. In all 53 cases in which we explicitly compared our results to those of an NEB calculation, the upper and lower bounds identified using this approach bracketed the TS energy calculated with explicit NEB calculations. We use the applications of diffusion of Na+ in potential sodium-ion battery electrodes and oxygen vacancy diffusion in solid oxide fuel cell electrodes and redox mediators for solar thermochemical hydrogen production to demonstrate the power of MSIST for analyzing the kinetics of bulk diffusion. For Na+ diffusion through 13 proposed electrode materials in which the average diffusion barrier was 0.28 eV, the average difference between the upper and lower bounds was 0.08 eV. An iterative application of this approach to the 3 materials with the largest difference between their upper and lower bounds further narrowed the average range of the bounded TS energies to 0.04 eV, while still requiring fewer force evaluations than an NEB TS calculation. When applied in a high throughput manner to study 514 diffusion pathways in 97 different materials, the average difference between the upper and lower bounds was 0.33 eV and the average barrier, as calculated by the average of all upper and lower bounds, was ~1.7 eV. Because the MSIST approach produces explicit errors, i.e. the difference between the upper and lower bounds energies, even predicted barrier ranges with large errors can be reliably modeled with weighted regression techniques. MSIST enables the analysis of the kinetics of solid state diffusion across larger sets of materials and can thus efficiently provide data to train statistically learned models of diffusion and to develop physical insights into the diffusion process.",

        "abstract": "The development of novel redox-active polymers for sustainable sodium ion batteries (SIBs) has captured growing attention, but battery performance has been significantly limited by poor reversible specific capacities, where the majority of aromatic C6-benzene linkages are redox inactive. Here, a simple, yet efficient approach to improve sodium (Na) storage on these C6-benzene rings within a porous polymeric framework by rationally regulating their steric hindrance is reported. Decreasing intrinsic hindrance affords a significant improvement in redox reaction kinetics within the porous architecture, thereby facilitating the acceptance of Na ions on these functionalized benzene rings and boosting the SIB performance. As a result, the modulate porous framework exhibits an exceptional battery capacity of 376 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1 , which is ≈1.5 times larger than that of the pristine framework. Furthermore, the performance can reach as high as 510 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 , comparable to that of the best-performing polymeric electrodes. The simple modulation approach not only enables Na storage modulation on functionalized C6-benzene rings, but also simultaneously provides a means to extend the understanding of the structure-property relationship and facilitate new possibilities for organic SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The rational design of hierarchical hollow nanomaterials is of critical significance in energy storage materials. Herein, dual-wall hollow nanospheres (DWHNS) Sn/MoS2@C are constructed by in situ confined growth and interface engineering. The inner hollow spheres of Sn/MoS2 are formed by atomic soldering MoS2 nanosheets with liquid Sn at high temperature. The formation mechanism of the hierarchical structure is explored by the morphology evolutions at different temperatures. The DWHNS Sn/MoS2@C manifest abundant inner space and high specific surface area, which provides more support sites for Li+/Na+/K+ storage and alleviates the volume effect of tin-based electrode materials to a certain extent. The composite material manifests an outstanding specific capacity and satisfactory reversibility of lithium ion batteries (∼931 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 500 cycles), sodium ion batteries (∼432 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 400 cycles), and potassium ion batteries (∼226 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 300 cycles). Additionally, the morphology evolution and mechanism analysis of DWHNS Sn/MoS2@C in alkali metal ion batteries are verified by ex situ measurement, which confirms the three-in-one hybrid storage mechanism, i.e., intercalation reaction of carbon shells, conversion reaction of MoS2, and alloying reaction of tin.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have emerged as a strong contender among the beyond lithium-ion chemistries due to elemental abundance and the low cost of sodium. Tin (Sn) is a promising alloying electrode with high capacity, redox reversibility, and earth abundance. Tin electrodes, however, undergo a series of intermediate reactions exhibiting multiple voltage plateaus upon sodiation/desodiation. Phase transformations related to incomplete sodiation in tin during cycling, in the presence of a frail solid electrolyte interphase layer, can quickly weaken the structural stability. The structural dynamics and reactivity of the electrode/electrolyte interface, being further dependent on the size and morphology of the active material particle in the presence of different electrolytes, dictate the electrode degradation and survivability during cycling. In this study, we paint a comprehensive picture of the underpinnings of the electrochemical and mechanics coupling and electrode/electrolyte interfacial interactions in alloying Sn electrodes. We elicit the fundamental role of electrode/electrolyte complexations in the Sn electrode structure-property-performance relationship based on multimodal analytics, including electrochemical, microscopy, and tomography analyses.",

        "abstract": "As a low-cost substitute of graphene and graphene derivatives, 2D carbon nanosheets are considered to be attractive materials for high-performance electrochemical energy-storage devices. Nevertheless, the lack of cost-effective and green preparation methods still greatly impedes the application of 2D carbon nanosheets in sodium-ion batteries. Herein, an environmental friendly and versatile strategy is proposed to engineer anisotropically curved nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (CNCNs) derived from biosources with hydrosoluble and recyclable flux. After undergoing serious corrosion from the LiCl/KCl binary flux, the resulting CNCNs possess high structural stability. Notably, the CNCNs also possess a rational specific surface area, open porous structure, and abundant accessible edges, which can shorten the ion-diffusion path, provide abundant accessible active sites, and result in less charge-transfer impedance and excellent sodium-ion diffusion coefficient (8.9×10-10  cm2  s-1 ). As a consequence, CNCN electrodes can deliver a high specific capacity of 361.6 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 . Such architecture provides a promising structural platform for the fabrication of 2D carbons for highly reversible and high capacity sodium-ion batteries.",

The positive electrode material, a graphite film (GF), features a layered structure, enabling the stable insertion and extraction of ions.

The anion-mediated ion-pair firstly weakens the electron withdrawing property of the cation, which effectively suppresses the gassing. In addition, the sieved electrolyte promotes the formation of robust inorganic-dominated solid electrolyte interphases. Therefore, it contributes to stable Na plating/stripping in Na|Al half cells with Coulombic efficiency maintaining at 98.5% and long service life of 800 cycles in full cells.

The CoS2-C/CNT nanocomposite provides excellent bifunctional energy storage performance, delivering 1030 mAh g-1 after 120 cycles and 403 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles (at 100 mA g-1) as electrode for lithium-ion (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), respectively. In addition to these high capacities, the electrodes show outstanding rate capability and excellent long-term cycling stability with a capacity retention of 80% after 500 cycles for LIBs and 90% after 200 cycles for SIBs. In situ X-ray diffraction reveals a significant contribution of the partially graphitized carbon to the lithium and at least in part also for the sodium storage and the report of a two-step conversion reaction mechanism of CoS2, eventually forming metallic Co and Li2S/Na2S. Particularly the lithium storage capability at elevated (dis-)charge rates, however, appears to be substantially pseudocapacitive, thus benefiting from the highly porous nature of the nanocomposite.",

        "abstract": "The application of small organic molecules for sodium‐ion batteries is generally plagued by their high solubility, poor conductivity, and sluggish redox dynamics in organic electrolyte, thus developing efficient strategies to restrain solubilization while obtaining fast charge transfer becomes a challenge. Herein, a rational hybridization strategy through hydrogen bond between organic molecule and inorganic substrate has been proposed, employing the terminal –C═O of trisodium 1, 2, 4‐benzenetricarboxylate (TBC) molecule and –OH groups of inorganic Ti3C2Tx MXene, respectively. In general, such a design evidently mitigates the aggregation of both TBC molecules and Ti3C2Tx MXene. Furthermore, the robust hydrogen bonding significantly mitigates the dissolution of TBC and guarantees the robust coupling between them, thus contributing to the integrity of electrode and modifying the electrochemical sodium storage in both half and full cells. Moreover, the systematic kinetic analysis and mechanism detection reveal improved charge transportation and robust two‐electron electrochemical reversibility of the hybrid TBC/Ti3C2Tx. Taken together, this work demonstrates a potential novel strategy toward stable and practical organic battery chemistries through hydrogen bonding with inorganic compounds.",

Particle dispersion is a key physical parameter of electrode materials, and understanding its impact on electrochemical performance is a prerequisite for obtaining high-performance PBAs. In this article, two PBAs samples with different particle dispersion were synthesized through sodium citrate-assisted co-precipitation method by means of staying and stirring. The influence of particle dispersion on electrochemical performance was investigated through polarization curve and AC impedance tests. It was found that PBAs with well-dispersed particles exhibited excellent rate performance, with a capacity of ~120 mAh g-1 at 1 C rate and a capacity retention of 75 % after 100 cycles. The capacity retention rate could reach 63 % at 5 C rate, far higher than that of PBAs samples with poor particle dispersion. From the perspective of electrochemical kinetics analysis, it has been shown that PBAs with well-dispersed particles exhibit smaller electrochemical polarization and faster Na+ diffusion reaction kinetics, which are key factors in achieving excellent rate performance.",

        "abstract": "The increasing interest in Na-ion batteries (NIBs) can be traced to sodium abundance, its low cost compared to lithium, and its intercalation chemistry being similar to that of lithium. We report that the electrochemical properties of a promising negative electrode material, Na2Ti3O7, are improved by exfoliating its layered structure and forming 2D nanoscale morphologies, nanoplatelets, and nanosheets. Exfoliation of Na2Ti3O7 was carried out by controlling the amount of proton exchange for Na+ and then proceeding with the intercalation of larger cations such as methylammonium and propylammonium. An optimized mixture of nanoplatelets and nanosheets exhibited the best electrochemical performance in terms of high capacities in the range of 100-150 mA h g-1 at high rates with stable cycling over several hundred cycles. These properties far exceed those of the corresponding bulk material, which is characterized by slow charge-storage kinetics and poor long-term stability. The results reported in this study demonstrate that charge-storage processes directed at 2D morphologies of surfaces and few layers of sheets are an exciting direction for improving the energy and power density of electrode materials for NIBs.",

        "abstract": "P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 (P2-NiMn) is one of the promising positive electrode materials for high-energy Na-ion batteries because of large reversible capacity and high working voltage by charging up to 4.5 V versus Na+/Na. However, the capacity rapidly decays during charge/discharge cycles, which is caused by the large volume shrinkage of ca. 23% by sodium deintercalation and following electric isolation of P2-NiMn particles in the composite electrode. Serious electrolyte decomposition at the higher voltage region than 4.1 V also brings deterioration of the particle surface and capacity decay during cycles. To solve these drawbacks, we apply water-soluble sodium poly-γ-glutamate (PGluNa) as an efficient binder to P2-NiMn instead of conventional poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVdF) and examined the electrode performances of P2-NiMn composite electrode with PGluNa binder for the first time. The PGluNa electrode shows Coulombic efficiency of 95% at the first cycle and capacity retention of 89% after 50 cycles, whereas the PVdF electrode exhibits only 80 and 71%, respectively. The alternating current impedance measurements reveal that the PGluNa electrode shows a much lower resistance during the cycles compared with the PVdF one. From the surface analysis and peeling test of the electrodes, the PGluNa binder was found to cover the surface of the P2-NiMn particles and suppresses the electrolyte decomposition and surface degradation. The PGluNa binder further enhance the mechanical strength of the electrodes and suppresses the electrical isolation of the P2-NiMn particles during sodium extraction/insertion. The efficient binder with noticeable adhesion strength and surface coverage of active materials and carbon has paved a new way to enhance the electrochemical performances of high-voltage positive electrode materials for Na-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The use of porous hard carbons (PHCs) as electrode materials in sodium-ion batteries has great potential; however, the exposure of large surface areas to electrolyte flow results in irregular and irreversible solid electrolyte interfaces (SEIs), leading to deteriorated ionic and electronic mobility and inferior initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). These issues can be addressed through suitable structural modifications of PHC materials. Herein, the integration of high-surface-area PHCs with carbon nanofibers (CNFs) was accomplished by a simple electrospinning technique, which resulted in a uniform and reversible SEI layer. In the meantime, the CNFs' mesh provided connectivity and conductivity in the as-integrated electrodes, whereas PHCs offered fast diffusion kinetics and high Na+ ion storage capacity. Additionally, PHC integration with CNFs demonstrated an excellent ICE of 77% and a specific capacity of 505 mAh/g at 25 mA/g. Furthermore, the conjugated microstructure also provided flexibility and stability to the electrode (260 mAh/g after 500 cycles). This remarkable synergy may promote the development of free-standing, flexible, and highly porous properties in a single material for advanced energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon, characterized by high ion storage capacity, low operating voltage, and excellent cycling stability, is considered an ideal negative electrode material for sodium‐ion batteries. However, the high cost and low carbon yield of thermosetting precursors limit their practical application in SIBs, while low‐cost and high‐yield raw materials exhibit highly ordered carbon structures and narrow interlayer spacing under high‐temperature carbonization. Discarded polyimide materials are inexpensive, which offer a high carbon yield and possess good thermal stability and thermoplasticity, with functional groups of imide rings (−CO−N−CO−) on their main chains. This study recycled and converted polyimide materials into hard carbon materials from discarded engineering plastics, investigating the influence of carbonization temperature on the degree of graphitization, interlayer spacing, and pore structure of the materials to achieve high reversible sodium storage capacity. After carbonization at 1300 °C, the polyimide material exhibited 319 mAh g−1 reversible capacity and excellent electrochemical performance (with a capacity retention of 91.92 % after 100 cycles at a 0.5 C current rate) and rate performance (up to 242.5 mAh g−1 at 2 C).

It is also found that surface redox reactions are responsible for Li storage in Mo2AlB2, instead of intercalation or conversion. Moreover, the sodium hydroxide treatment of MoAlB leads to a porous morphology and higher specific capacities exceeding that of pristine MoAlB. When tested in SIBs, Mo2AlB2 exhibits a specific capacity of 150 mAh g−1 at 20 mA g−1.

Taking this into account, herein we combine the EPR and 23Na MAS NMR spectroscopic techniques to gain insights into the structural peculiarities of the mixed cobalt-nickel-manganese layers of NayCo1-2xNixMnxO2 with a three-layer stacking (P3-type) structure. Two types of compositions are examined where diamagnetic Co3+ and paramagnetic Ni3+ and Mn4+ are stabilized: Na2/3Co1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2 and Na1/2Ni1/2Mn1/2O2. EPR spectroscopy operating in the X- and Q-band region is applied with an aim to improve the spectra resolution and, on the other hand, to provide straightforward information on the coordination of the transition metal ions inside the layers. The analysis of EPR spectra is based on the reference for the Mn4+ and Ni2+ ions occurring simultaneously in oxides with two layer stacking, P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2. Complementary to EPR, 23Na MAS NMR spectroscopy at high spinning rates is undertaken to assess the local structure of the Na nucleus in the layered P3-NayCo1-2xNixMnxO2 oxides. All results are discussed taking into account the EPR and NMR data for the well-known lithium analogues O3-LiCo1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2 and O3-LiNi1/2Mn1/2O2. Finally, the structure peculiarities of the transition metal layers extracted from the EPR and NMR methods are demonstrated by electrochemical intercalation of Li+ ions into P3-NayCo1-2xNixMnxO2.",

However, the relatively low volumetric density and high fragile structure are the obstacles blocking the development of hollow-structured electrode materials. In this work, ball-in-ball structured (Ni0.33Co0.67)9S8@C nanospheres have been synthesized by using NiCo-glycerate as the precursor via solvothermal reaction, which was followed by a carbon coating treatment. In this structural design, hollow cavities are generated between the inner and outer balls to effectively accommodate the volume changes of the metal sulfides in the processes of charging/discharging, while the uniform carbon coating can increase the electrical conductivity and maintain the structural stability during repeated cycling. The Rietveld refinement, in situ X-ray diffraction, and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses provide evidence for an enlarged lattice parameter, weaker Co-S and Ni-S bonding, and a synergistic effect in the (Ni0.33Co0.67)9S8@C towards boosting the conversion reaction and reversible formation of sulfur in the fully charged state, with the sulfur trapped within the composite to additionally account for the superior cycling stability of this material. Capacitive behavior has been verified to dominate the electrochemical reaction, enabling fast charge transport kinetics.

Framework Prussian blue analogs and dense niobium oxides have been identified as high-rate electrodes for sodium- and lithium-ion batteries, respectively, yet the origin of the extremely high solid-state Na+/Li+ transport is not fully understood. Of critical importance is the fact that their ultra-low activation energy and anomalous pre-exponent factor cannot be satisfactorily rationalized from conventional theory of solid-state diffusion in the crystal lattice. Here, assisted by density-functional-theory calculations, we argued that the true origin is a unique surface-like diffusion mechanism of the intercalation ions. In a surface-like migration event, a mobile ion moves along the channel wall via a low coordination number and low migration barrier experiencing minimal steric hindrance. It is similar to surface diffusion in the conventional picture and contrasts with lattice diffusion from one interstitial/vacancy site to another one with high coordination number, crowded saddle-point geometry and high migration barrier.

        "abstract": "The development of hard carbon (HC) electrodes using biobased binders, formulated in water solvent, is of great interest for Na-ion batteries. Five Na-carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binders with different molecular weights and degrees of substitution were investigated. The increase in the CMC molecular weight led to an increase in the volume of water necessary for slurry preparation and a decrease in the electrode mass loading. Moreover, the adhesion of the slurry was strongly impacted by the aluminum current collector properties. A high initial Coulombic efficiency, iCE (up to ∼90%), and reversible capacity (up to 334 mAh g-1 at C/10) were obtained in Na half-cells. Post-mortem XPS analyses performed on several electrodes under various conditions allowed a better understanding of the formation and composition of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. The genesis of SEI was initially chemically driven: to a small extent, by HC and to a greater extent, by the Na metal. However, SEI formation was mainly governed by the electrochemical-driven degradation of the electrolyte salt and solvent. The SEI layer composed of an inorganic-rich core and an organic-rich shell significantly decreased the resistance of the HC electrode, allowing superior iCE while maintaining high capacity retention (96.2%), after 100 cycles at 1C.",

        "abstract": "Na-ion batteries are one of the best technologies for large-scale applications depending on almost infinite and widespread sodium resources. However, the state-of-the-art separators cannot meet the engineering needs of large-scale sodium-ion batteries to match the intensively investigated electrode materials. Here, a kind of flexible modified cellulose acetate separator (MCA) for sodium-ion batteries was synthesized via the electrospinning process and subsequently optimizing the interface chemical groups by changing acetyl to hydroxyl partly. Upon the rational design, the flexible MCA separator exhibits high chemical stability and excellent wettability (contact angles nearly 0°) in electrolytes (EC/PC, EC/DMC, diglyme, and triglyme). Moreover, the flexible MCA separator shows high onset temperature of degradation (over 250 °C) and excellent thermal stability (no shrinkage at 220 °C). Electrochemical measurements, importantly, show that the Na-ion batteries with flexible MCA separator exhibit ultralong cycle life (93.78%, 10 000 cycles) and high rate capacity (100.1 mAh g-1 at 10 C) in the Na/Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) half cell (2.5-4.0 V) and good cycle performance (98.59%, 100 cycles) in the Na/SnS2 half cell (0.01-3 V), respectively. Moreover, the full cell (SnS2/NVP) with flexible MCA separator displays the capacity of 98 mAh g-1 and almost no reduction after 40 cycles at 0.118 A g-1. Thus, this work provides a kind of flexible modified cellulose acetate separator for Na-ion batteries with great potential for practical large-scale applications.",

Despite tremendous studies carried out, the sodium storage mechanism is still under discussion, and the electronic and local structures of TiO2 during sodiation/desodiation process are not well understood either. Herein, we reported a mechanism study of graphene-supported oxygen-deficient anatase TiO2 nanotubes (nanowires) as the negative electrode material for sodium ion batteries. Different from the previous reports, the insertion/extraction of Na+ ions leads to almost no changes of titanium valence state but there is a charge redistribution of O 2p orbitals which alters the hybridization between O 2p and Ti 3d states, suggested by the combined electrochemical and X-ray spectroscopic study. Both the electronic and local structures of TiO2 during the reversible sodiation/desodiation process are revealed from the Ti L-edge and O K-edge spectra. This detailed study would shed light on the material design and structural optimization of TiO2 as energy storage material in different systems.",

        "abstract": "FeS2 is a promising electrode material for alkali metal ion storage due to its high theoretical capacity. However, it still faces critical issues such as suboptimal rate and cycling performances owing to sluggish charge transport and significant volume variations. Herein, we constructed FeS2 (m-FeS2) and pyrite FeS2 (p-FeS2) nanocomposites embedded in N,S-doped carbon nanoboxes (m/p-FeS2@NSCN) to conquer such challenges. The microstructure design of nanoboxes effectively alleviates the stress caused by the volume expansion of FeS2 during lithiation processes, thereby improving the cycling stability of the FeS2 electrode. The marcasite/pyrite compositing design further increases the electronic conductivity of FeS2 and optimizes ion migration. As expected, the target m/p-FeS2@NSCN exhibits improved rate capability (595.5 mA h g-1 at 5.0 A g-1) and robust cycling stability (500 cycles without significant capacity decay at 0.1 A g-1) in lithium-ion batteries. Furthermore, m/p-FeS2@NSCN also shows excellent battery performances and potential application prospects in the field of sodium-ion batteries. It achieves a capacity of 355 mA h g-1 at 10.0 A g-1 and sustains 800 cycles without noticeable capacity decay at 0.5 A g-1.

        "abstract": "Technological advancement has been revolutionized by rechargeable batteries, without which the use of various modern devices would not be possible. Aqueous Na ion batteries have lately garnered much attention, being recognized as a promising alternative to the commonly used Li ion batteries for the large-scale energy storage systems. However, further improvement and optimization of such systems require a more detailed understanding of intercalation mechanisms. In this work, we for the first time demonstrate the implementation of the laser-induced current transient (LICT) technique for in situ characterization of battery systems and investigate the interface between Na2Ni[Fe(CN)6] model battery electrodes and aqueous electrolytes in contact with aqueous electrolytes. Quite counterintuitively, the LICT method revealed that at the quasi-steady-state the electrode surface stays positively charged within the potential range where the intercalation/deintercalation of sodium as well as of potassium is possible, evidencing that the intercalation mechanism of the alkali-metal cations should be rather complex. Furthermore, the specific shape of the observed current transients indicates that the interfacial processes of intercalation/deintercalation have at least three different relaxation time constants. The relaxation behavior is highly influenced by the nature of the alkali-metal cations-most likely through their different solvation energy. In addition, we outline how the laser-based experiments can intensify detailed in situ investigations of battery systems.",

The resulted TCM electrode exhibits an extremely high retention of 96% initial charge capacity after 500 cycles at a current density of 500 mA g-1 . Significantly, when the current density is elevated to an ultrahigh rate of 5000 mA g-1 , a high reversible capacity of 228 mAh g-1 after the 2000th cycle is still maintained. More importantly, the stable and fast Na-storage of TCM is investigated and understood by experimental characterizations and kinetics calculations, including interfacial ion/electron transport behavior, ion diffusion, and quantitative pseudocapacitive analysis. These investigations elucidate that the TCM shows improved ion/electron conductivity and enhanced interfacial kinetics. An entirely new perspective to deep insights into the fast ion/electron transport mechanisms revealed by interfacial kinetics of sodiation/desodiation, which contributes to the profound understanding for developing fast charging/discharging and long-term stable electrodes in sodium-ion batteries, is provided.",

This report unlocks a design paradigm of VSe2−x/C in‐plane heterojunction with built‐in anion vacancy, achieved through an in situ functionalization and self‐limited growth approach. Theoretical and experimental investigations reveal the bifunctional role of the Se vacancy in enhancing the ion diffusion kinetics and the structural thermodynamics of NaxVSe2 active phases. Moreover, this in‐plane heterostructure facilitates complete face contact between the two components and tight interfacial conductive contact between the conversion phases, resulting in enhanced reaction reversibility. The VSe2−x/C heterojunction electrode exhibits remarkable sodium‐ion storage performance, retaining specific capacities of 448.7 and 424.9 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at current densities of 5 and 10 A g−1, respectively. Moreover, it exhibits a high specific capacity of 353.1 mAh g−1 even under the demanding condition of 100 A g−1, surpassing most previous achievements. The proposed strategy can be extended to other V5S8−x and V2O5−x‐based heterojunctions, marking a conceptual breakthrough in advanced electrode design for constructing high‐performance sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Using oxidizing compounds to handle the recycling of discarded lithium batteries has advanced significantly in recent years. One of the most prominent methods is the sintered electrode powder treatment using pre-used additives, with an aqueous solution of the oxidizing agent fueling highly selective lithium extraction and transition metals retention in the refractory material. Herein, phosphoric acid (H3PO4) was used as the exchanger and hydrogen ions provider, the oxidant (K2S2O8) activity was driven by heating, the raw material structure was deformed and adjusted by the oxidizing drive, and lithium was exhausted, while manganese was converted into manganese(III) phosphate hydrate and manganese dioxide insoluble material. The optimized conditions resulted in a lithium leaching rate of 94.16% and a separation factor of 95.74%, while the corresponding manganese leaching rate was limited to less than 5%. The X-ray diffraction, X-ray spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry measurements were used to investigate the influence of oxidation driving force and lithium leaching. Finally, the lithium leach solution was continuously stirred with sodium carbonate in boiling water to obtain the precipitate, which was separated and washed several times to obtain high-purity lithium carbonate.",

        "abstract": "There is a crucial need for low-cost energy storage technology based on abundant sodium ions to realize sustainable development with renewable energy resources. Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) is applied as a binder in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, PVDF is also known to suffer from a larger irreversible capacity, especially when PVDF is used as the binder of negative electrode materials. In this research, a poly(acrylonitrile)-grafted poly(vinyl alcohol) copolymer (PVA-g-PAN) is tested as a binder with Ti-based layered oxides as potential negative electrode materials for SIBs. The chemical stability tests of PVDF and PVA-g-PAN contacted with metallic sodium have been conducted, which reveals that PVDF experiences a defluorination process, while PVA-g-PAN demonstrates excellent chemical stability. Composite electrodes with PVA-g-PAN demonstrate superior electrochemical performances when compared with the PVDF binder, allowing improvement for initial CE, higher rate capability, and long cyclability over 1500 cycles. Detailed characterization of electrodes via soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy demonstrates that the PVA-g-PAN branched structure allows a more uniform distribution of acetylene black with higher coatability, unlocking enhanced rate performances and efficient passivation of Ti-based oxides without the excessive electrolyte decomposition. These findings open a new way to design practical and durable sodium-ion batteries with a high-power density.",

The development of new electrolytes for SIBs is imperative since it impacts battery life and capacity. Currently, sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) is used as the benchmark salt, but is highly hygroscopic and generates toxic HF. This work describes the synthesis of a series of sodium borate salts, with electrochemical studies revealing that Na[B(hfip)4]⋅DME (hfip=hexafluoroisopropyloxy, OiPrF) and Na[B(pp)2] (pp=perfluorinated pinacolato, O2C2(CF3)4) have excellent electrochemical performance. The [B(pp)2]− anion also exhibits a high tolerance to air and water. Both electrolytes give more stable electrode‐electrolyte interfaces than conventionally used NaPF6, as demonstrated by impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, they give greater cycling stability and comparable capacity to NaPF6 for SIBs, as shown in commercial pouch cells.",

Attempts to pursue high rate ability with maintained high capacity in a single electrode remains even more challenging. Here, an elaborate self-branched 2D SnS2 (B-SnS2) nanoarray electrode is designed by a facile hot bath method for Na storage. This interesting electrode exhibits areal reversible capacity of ca. 3.7 mAh cm-2 (900 mAh g-1) and rate capability of 1.6 mAh cm-2 (400 mAh g-1) at 40 mA cm-2 (10 A g-1). Improved extrinsic pseudocapacitive contribution is demonstrated as the origin of fast kinetics of an alloying-based SnS2 electrode. Sodiation dynamics analysis based on first-principles calculations, ex-situ HRTEM, in situ impedance, and in situ Raman technologies verify the S-edge effect on the fast Na+ migration and reversible and sensitive structure evolution during high-rate charge/discharge. The excellent alloying-based pseudocapacitance and unsaturated edge effect enabled by self-branched surface nanoengineering could be a promising strategy for promoting development of SIBs with both high capacity and high rate response.",

The sodiation of metal sulfides can undergo a distinct process compared to that of lithiation, which is determined by their metal and structural types. However, the structural and morphological evolution during its electrochemical sodiation is still unclear. Here, we studied the sodiation reaction dynamics of TiS2 by employing in situ transmission electron microscopy and first-principles calculations. During the sodium ion intercalation process, we observed multiple intermediate phases (phase II, phase Ib, and phase Ia), different from its lithiation counterpart, with varied sodium occupation sites and interlayer stacking sequences. Further insertion of Na ions prompted a multi-step extrusion reaction which led to the phase separation of Ti metal from the Na2S matrix, with its 2D morphology expanded to a 3D morphology. In contrast to regular conversion electrodes, TiS2 still maintained a compacted structure after a full sodiation. Frist-principles calculations reveal that the as-identified phases are thermodynamically preferred at corresponding intercalation/extrusion stages compared to other possible phases. The present work provides the fundamental mechanistic understanding of the sodiation process of 2D transition metal sulfides.",

From the cyclic voltammograms, both lithium ion and sodium ion can reversibly insert into/from CNSs in all of the electrolytes used here.

The interfacial charge-transfer resistances at the interface between CNSs and organic electrolytes were evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. In the Nyquist plots, the semicircles at the middle-frequency region were assigned to the parallel circuits of charge-transfer resistances and capacitances. The interfacial sodium-ion transfer resistances in concentrated organic electrolytes were much smaller than those in dilute electrolytes, and the rate capability of CNS electrodes in sodium salt-concentrated electrolytes might be better than in dilute electrolytes, suggesting that CNSs with concentrated electrolytes are the candidate of SIB negative electrode materials with high rate capability.

        "abstract": "The electrochemical intercalation/deintercalation of solvated sodium ions into graphite is a highly reversible process, but leads to large, undesired electrode expansion/shrinkage (“breathing”). Herein, two strategies to mitigate the electrode expansion are studied. Starting with the standard configuration (−) sodium | diglyme (2G) electrolyte | graphite (poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) binder) (+), the PVDF binder is first replaced with a binder made of the sodium salt of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Second, ethylenediamine (EN) is added to the electrolyte solution as a co‐solvent. The electrode breathing is followed in situ (operando) through electrochemical dilatometry (ECD). It is found that replacing PVDF with CMC is only effective in reducing the electrode expansion during initial sodiation. During cycling, the electrode breathing for both binders is comparable. Much more effective is the addition of EN. The addition of 10 v/v EN to the diglyme electrolyte strongly reduces the electrode expansion during the initial sodiation (+100% with EN versus +175% without EN) as well as the breathing during cycling. A more detailed analysis of the ECD signals reveals that solvent co‐intercalation temporarily leads to pillaring of the graphite lattice and that the addition of EN to 2G leads to a change in the sodium storage mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Sodium (Na)-ion batteries are the most explored 'beyond-Li' battery systems, yet their energy densities are still largely limited by the positive electrode material. Na3FeF6 is a promising Earth-abundant containing electrode and operates through a conversion-type charge-discharge reaction associated with a high theoretical capacity (336 mA h g-1). In practice, however, only a third of this capacity is achieved during electrochemical cycling. In this study, we demonstrate a new rapid and environmentally-friendly assisted-microwave method for the preparation of Na3FeF6. A comprehensive understanding of charge-discharge processes and of the reactivity of the cycled electrode samples is achieved using a combination of electrochemical tests, synchrotron X-ray diffraction, 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, magnetometry, and 23Na/19F solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) complemented with first principles calculations of NMR properties. We find that the primary performance limitation of the Na3FeF6 electrode is the sluggish kinetics of the conversion reaction, while the methods employed for materials synthesis and electrode preparation do not have a significant impact on the conversion efficiency and reversibility. Our work confirms that Na3FeF6 undergoes conversion into NaF and Fe(s) nanoparticles. The latter are found to be prone to oxidation prior to ex situ measurements, thus necessitating a robust analysis of the stable phases (here, NaF) formed upon conversion.",

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) Ti3C2 MXene has attracted great attention in electrochemical energy storage devices (supercapacitors and lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries) due to its excellent electrical conductivity as well as high volumetric capacity. Nevertheless, a previous study showed that multivalent Mg2+ ions cannot reversibly insert into MXene, resulting in a negligible capacity. Here, we demonstrate a simple strategy to achieve high magnesium storage capability for Ti3C2 MXene by preintercalating a cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Density functional theory simulations verify that intercalated CTA+ cations reduce the diffusion barrier of Mg2+ on the MXene surface, resulting in the significant improvement of the reversible insertion/deinsertion of Mg2+ ions between MXene layers. Consequently, the MXene electrode exhibits a desirable volumetric specific capacity of 300 mAh cm-3 at 50 mA g-1 as well as outstanding rate performance. This work endows MXene material with an application in electrochemical energy storage and, simultaneously, introduces magnesium battery materials as a member.",

        "abstract": "Due to their low yield and easy aggregation during the electrode preparation process, exfoliated MoS2 monolayers cannot fulfill the requirements of alkali-metal-ion battery tests. Hence, we have developed a facile process to fabricate powder exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets capable of large-scale production and having highly monolayer-rich structures. This process contains two steps: liquid-phase exfoliation of the edge-rich MoS2 precursor and a freeze-drying procedure. The proposed MoS2 precursors contain rich edge fractions that are easily exfoliated by this method, and the freeze-drying procedure can maintain the unique monolayer-rich structure of MoS2 in the powder phase. The electrochemical evaluations of both lithium- and sodium-ion batteries reveal that the proposed powder exfoliated monolayer-rich MoS2 electrode exhibits remarkable specific capacities and stable cyclic performances. In particular, the monolayer-rich MoS2 nanosheet electrode delivers a superior lithium-storage capacity of ∼1400 mA h g-1. The exfoliated MoS2 nanosheet electrode can withstand over 1000 cycles even at 1 A g-1. The mechanism reveals that these unique MoS2 nanosheets not only have a large surface area but also their inclusive monolayer structures exhibit much higher charge mobility than those of bulk MoS2.",

The elemental and structural characteristics offer us to explore their applications in energy, environment, bioscience, medicine, electronics and others. Among them, energy storage and conversion are extremely attractive topics, which will improve our life quality and make our environments clean. Some energy devices will be included, such as lithium-ion batteries, lithium sulfur batteries, sodium-ion batteries, potassium-ion batteries, dual ion batteries, electrochemical capacitors, and others. Additionally, carbon-based electrocatalysts are also studied in hydrogen evolution reaction and carbon dioxide reduction reaction. However, there are still many challenges in the design and preparation of electrode and electrocatalytic materials. The research related to carbon materials for energy storage and conversion is at extremely active stage, and this has motivated us to contribute with a roadmap on 'Carbon Materials in Energy Storage and Conversion'.",

However, the issues of poor reaction kinetics, rapid capacity decay and severe polarization due to volume changes during electrochemical reaction are still huge challenges for cobalt sulfides in practical applications. Herein, we have synthesized cobalt sulfides yolk-shell spheres by phosphorus doping (P-CoS) to stabilize the structure of cobalt sulfides and improve its electronic/ion conductivity. Kinetic tests and density functional theory calculations confirm that the introduction of phosphorus into cobalt sulfides greatly reduces the diffusion barrier of Li + in the intrinsic structure, thereby improving the reaction kinetics of electrode materials during the Li +  insertion/extraction process. In consequence, the P-CoS electrode delivers a high lithium storage capacity (781 mAh g -1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 A g -1 ), outstanding rate capability (489 mAh g -1 at 10 A g -1 ) and good long-term cycling stability (no obvious capacity decay over 4000 cycles at 5 A g -1 ). Especially for the sodium-ion batteries application, the P-CoS yolk-shell spheres show a remarkably reversible capacity of about 260 mAh g -1 at 2 A g -1 after 900 cycles.",

Recently, this have been partly discovered as Na3LiTi5O12 (NTO) phase in the Li4Ti5O12 particle. However, the single-phase NTO material have never been obtained, preventing accurate material characterizations and applications. Here, we successfully realized the NTO material with single-phase by chemical sodium insertion-extraction process. The chemical sodium-inserted LTO material is well converted to pure NTO phase in the single particle level, via following chemical oxidation by water. The purified material was about 97 mol % of NTO as single-phase spinel structure with a = 8.746 Å. The basic lattice framework of prepared NTO was confirmed as same as the LTO. The single-phase NTO electrode show 0.8 V vs Na+/Na of Na-insertion and extraction potential, and 99.4 % of Na-insertion capacity with 99.7 % of coulombic efficiency during 200 cycles of Na-ion half-cell experiment. Further, the Na2Fe2(SO4)3 / NTO full-cell shows 3 V-class stable charge-discharge character during 100 cycles.

The current reaches about 50.0 mA at an applied bias of 2.0 V for the optimized sample with 2.22 at% sulfur doping. This current value is much higher than that of RGO sheets (∼1.2 mA) annealed at 200 °C, and very close to that of single-layer graphene sheets (∼68.0 mA) prepared using chemical vapor deposition under the same test conditions.

        "abstract": "Constructing potential electrode materials with a wide temperature property for high energy density second batteries has attracted huge interests in recent years. Herein, a hybrid electrode, consisting of nitrogen-doped carbon/α-MnS/flake graphite composite (α-MnS@N-C/FG), was prepared via a post-sulfurization route. In the α-MnS@N-C/FG composite, α-MnS nanoparticles that wrapped by N-C layer are uniformly embedded onto FG, forming a novel nanofoam structure. As-obtained α-MnS@N-C/FG shows excellent lithium/sodium storage performance, with a specific capacity of 712 mAh g-1 in the 700th cycle at 1.0 A g-1 or 186.4 mAh g-1 in the 100th cycle at 100 mA g-1 using lithium or sodium foil as the counter electrode, respectively. Moreover, even operated at stern temperature of -20 oC, the α-MnS@N-C/FG can still attain high specific capacity of 350 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles at 100 mA g-1 for LIBs. This exceptional electrochemical response is endorsed to the synergetic effect of the smart design of a hybrid nanofoam structure, in which the FG skeleton and N-C coating layer can significantly enhance the conductivity of the whole electrode from bottom to up. Accordingly, the enhanced redox kinetics endow the electrode with pseudocapacitive-dominated electrochemical behaviors, thus bringing fast electrode reactions and robust structural stability to the whole electrode.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The interfacial reactions in sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are not well understood yet. The formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in SIBs is still challenging due to the higher solubility of the SEI components compared to lithium analogues. This study therefore aims to shed light on the dissolution of SEI influenced by the electrolyte chemistry. By conducting electrochemical tests with extended open circuit pauses, and using surface spectroscopy, we determine the extent of self‐discharge due to SEI dissolution. Instead of using a conventional separator, β‐alumina was used as sodium‐conductive membrane to avoid crosstalk between the working and sodium‐metal counter electrode. The relative capacity loss after a pause of 50 hours in the tested electrolyte systems ranges up to 30 %. The solubility of typical inorganic SEI species like NaF and Na2CO3 was determined. The electrolytes were then saturated by those SEI species in order to oppose ageing due to the dissolution of the SEI.",

        "abstract": "As a promising candidate for next-generation energy storage devices, Zn metal battery excels with their good safety, high speciﬁc capacity, and economic attractiveness. However, it still suﬀers from a narrow electrochemical window, notorious dendrite formation, and sluggish Zn ion transfer. Aqueous electrolyte engineering has been regarded as an eﬀective way to improve these. It is shown that by adding sodium polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) polymers into a dilute 1 m Zn(OTf) 2 aqueous electrolyte, compact water shells with stronger hydrogen bonding and more ordered structures are formed around the polymer chains. As a result, a fast transport channel to the zinc ions is provided. The PSS chains also protect the zinc electrode from directly contacting the water molecules and thus suppress water decomposition. With these merits, a Zn//Cu cell demonstrates a high coulombic eﬃciency of ≈ 99% after 1500 h cycling. Meanwhile, a record-high cumulative Zn plating capacity of 10 000 mA h cm − 2 is obtained using a Zn||Zn cell. In addition, the Zn//C@V 2 O 5 full cell achieves almost 100% capacity retention after 1000 cycles. This work provides a new strategy for designing advanced electrolyte systems excelling in ion transport kinetics.",

        "abstract": "Structural trends, physical properties, and electrochemical performances of the NaFexRu2-xO4 system have been investigated. Synthesis attempts using both conventional solid-state routes and high-pressure methods were explored for the compositional range 1.0 ≤ x ≤ 1.67. Based on Rietveld refinements against powder X-ray diffraction data, analyses of 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy data, and elemental analysis by electron microprobe, the existence of a confined compositional solid solution (1 ≤ x ≤ 1.3) adopting the CaFe2O4-type postspinel structure is demonstrated. This is contrasted with the NaFexTi2-xO4 system, for which no evidence of a solid solution is observed. However, for all explored synthetic routes of NaFexRu2-xO4 compositions, a trivalent iron oxidation state is maintained. Structural analysis and qualitative bond valence energy landscape models reveal that the progressive integration of iron into the postspinel framework results in narrowed sodium ion diffusion channels, restricting electrochemical deintercalation of sodium. Consequently, the CaFe2O4-type iron-rich compounds explored in this study demonstrate limited potential as positive electrode materials for sodium batteries. It is expected that this fundamental insight will help guide the exploration of alternative NaM2O4-based positive electrode materials with similar structure types.",

Among the many potential candidates, layered compounds such as MoS2 have attracted increasing attention. However, such materials have not yet fulfilled their true potential. Here, we show that networks of liquid phase exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets, reinforced with 20 wt % single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), can be formed into sodium-ion battery electrodes with large gravimetric, volumetric, and areal capacity. The MoS2/SWNT composite films are highly porous, electrically conductive, and mechanically robust due to its percolating carbon nanotube network. When directly employed as the working electrode, they exhibit a specific capacity of >400 mAh/g and volumetric capacity of ∼650 mAh/cm(3). Their mechanical stability allows them to be processed into free-standing films with tunable thickness up to ∼100 μm, corresponding to an areal loading of 15 mg/cm(2). Their high electrical conductivity allows the high volumetric capacity to be retained, even at high thickness, resulting in state-of-the-art areal capacities of >4.0 mAh/cm(2). Such values are competitive with their lithium-ion counterparts.",

        "abstract": "Vanadium-based oxides with relatively high theoretical capacity have been regarded as promising electrode materials for boosting energy conversion and storage. However, their poor electrical conductivity usually leads to unsatisfied performance and poor cycling stability. Herein, uniform V2O3/N-doped carbon hollow nanospheres (V2O3/NC HSs) with mesoporous structures were successfully synthesized through a melamine-assisted simple hydrothermal reaction and carbonization treatment. We demonstrated that the introduction of melamine played an essential role in the construction of V2O3/NC HSs. Benefitting from the special mesoporous structure and large specific surface area, the as-obtained sample exhibited enhanced conductivity and structural stability. As a proof of concept, well-defined V2O3/NC HSs exhibited excellent cycling stability and rate performance for sodium-ion batteries, and achieved a discharge capacity of 263.8 mA h g-1 at a current density of 1.0 A g-1 after 1000 cycles, one of the best performances of V-based compounds. The enhanced performance could be attributed to the synergistic effect of the hollow structure and surface carbon coating.

In this contribution, we examine in detail the crystal structure of Mg-substituted NaMnPO4. The preferential occupancy of the alkaline M1 position by Mg2+ ions has been found for the first time - a phenomenon which appears to be opposite to the case of Mg-substituted LiMnPO4, where Mg2+ and Mn2+ reside in the M2 position. Mg solubility in NaMnPO4 is limited in the range of 0.10 < Mg/(Mg + Mn) < 0.15 mole part. Mg-substituted NaMnPO4 is prepared at 200 °C by ionic exchange reactions involving the participation of mixed dittmarite salts, KMn1-xMgxPO4·H2O. The structural aspects of Mg substitution in NaMnPO4 are studied by combination of powder X-ray diffraction using the Rietveld analysis with IR and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The morphologies of precursors and target olivines are examined by means of SEM and EDS. In order to understand the crystal chemistry of Mg-substituted NaMnPO4, we use solid solutions between LiMnPO4 and LiMgPO4 as references.

It has the inherent advantages of shorter paths for ion insertion and extraction, larger contact area for more sodium diffusion pathways and superior electrolyte penetration. Benefiting from the Ni intercalated bilayer SnS2, the internal adjustment of electronic state and the enlarged interlayer spacing significantly enhanced electron transport kinetics, which can be explained by the metallic state related properties.

However, the further application of alkali metal batteries based on liquid electrolytes is limited due to increasing safety concerns. Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs), which combine the advantages of the high ionic conductivity of liquid electrolytes and excellent mechanical properties of solid polymer electrolytes, are considered to play an irreplaceable role in the realization of high-performance alkali metal batteries. In this work, a flexible boron-containing GPE (B-GPE) with a cross-linked polymer network structure is prepared by a UV-induced process. The as-prepared B-GPE exhibits good ionic conductivity and has an extremely high ion transference number due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the boron moiety and the facile electrolyte uptake ability of the ethylene oxide chain. Furthermore, a \"gentle\" electrode/electrolyte contact is designed by a one-step in situ polymerization method, which can enhance ion transport within the electrode and at the electrode/electrolyte interface due to the presence of a continuous polymer phase for ion conduction. Therefore, LMBs and SMBs containing B-GPE are able to effectively inhibit the growth of dendrites while exhibiting excellent cycling stability. These comprehensive results indicate that this novel B-GPE possesses potential applications for high-performance alkali metal batteries.",

Herein, we report a facile electron injection strategy for phase transition engineering and fabricate a composite of conductive TiO chemically bonded to 1T-MoS2 nanoflowers (TiO-1T-MoS2 NFs) on a large scale. The underlying mechanism analysis reveals that electron-injection-engineering triggers a reorganization of the Mo 4d orbitals and results in a 100% phase transition of MoS2 from 2H to 1T. In the TiO-1T-MoS2 NFs composite, the 1T-MoS2 demonstrates a higher electronic conductivity, a lower Na+ diffusion barrier, and a more restricted S release than 2H-MoS2. In addition, conductive TiO bonding successfully resolves the stability challenge of the 1T phase. These merits endow TiO-1T-MoS2 NFs electrodes with an excellent rate capability (650/288 mAh g-1 at 50/20 000 mA g-1, respectively) and an outstanding cyclability (501 mAh g-1 at 1000 mA g-1 after 700 cycles) in sodium ion batteries. Such an improvement signifies that this facile and scalable phase-transition engineering combined with a deep mechanism analysis offers an important reference for designing advanced materials for various applications.",

        "abstract": "Redox-active covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a new class of material with the potential to transform electrochemical energy storage due to the well-defined porosity and readily accessible redox-active sites of COFs. However, combining both high specific capacity and energy density in COF-based batteries remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we demonstrate the exceptional performance of Aza-COF in rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Aza-COF is a microporous 2D COF synthesized from hexaketocyclohexane and 1,2,4,5-benzenetetramine by a condensation reaction, which affords phenazine-decorated channels and a theoretical specific capacity of 603 mA h g-1. The Aza-COF-based electrode exhibits an exceptional average specific capacity (550 mA h g-1), energy density (492 W h kg-1) at 0.1 C, and power density (1182 W kg-1) at 40 C. The high capacity and energy density are attributed to swift surface-controlled redox processes and rapid sodium-ion diffusion inside the porous electrode. Rate capability studies showed that the battery also performs well at high current rates: 1 C (363 mA h g-1), 5 C (232 mA h g-1), 10 C (161 mA h g-1), and 20 C (103 mA h g-1). In addition, the long-term cycling stability test revealed very good capacity retention (87% at 5 C) and Coulombic efficiencies near unity over 500 cycles.",

        "abstract": "The title compounds were prepared via a wet chemistry route and their crystal structures were determined from single crystal X-ray diffraction data. Na2Mn(SO4)2·4H2O crystallizes with a monoclinic symmetry, space group P21/c, with a = 5.5415(2), b = 8.3447(3), c = 11.2281(3) Å, β = 100.172(1)°, V = 511.05(3) Å3 and Z = 2. Na2Ni(SO4)2·10H2O also crystallizes with a monoclinic symmetry, space group P21/c, with a = 12.5050(8), b = 6.4812(4), c = 10.0210(6) Å, β = 106.138(2)°, V = 780.17(8) Å3 and Z = 2. Na2Mn(SO4)2·4H2O is a new member of the blödite family of compounds, whereas Na2Ni(SO4)2·10H2O is isostructural with Na2Mg(SO4)2·10H2O. The structure of Na2Mn(SO4)2·4H2O is built up of [Mn(SO4)2(H2O)4]2− building blocks connected through moderate O–H⋯O hydrogen bonds with the sodium atoms occupying the large tunnels along the a axis and the manganese atom lying on an inversion center, whereas the structure of Na2Ni(SO4)2·10H2O is built up of [Ni(H2O)6]2+ and [Na2(SO4)2(H2O)4]2− layers. These layers which are parallel to the (100) plane are interconnected through moderate O–H⋯O hydrogen bonds. The thermal gravimetric- and the powder X-ray diffraction-analyzes showed that only the nickel phase was almost pure. At a temperature above 300 °C, all the water molecules evaporated and a structural phase transition from P21/c-Na2Ni(SO4)2·10H2O to C2/c-Na2Ni(SO4)2 was observed. C2/c-Na2Ni(SO4)2 is thermally more stable than Na2Fe(SO4)2 and therefore it would be suitable as the positive electrode for sodium ion batteries if a stable electrolyte at high voltage is developed.",

        "abstract": "For alkali-metal ion batteries, revealing the phase transformation and the ion migration dynamics in the electrodes is vital for understanding how the electrodes work and thereby how we can improve them. Here, using in situ transmission electron microscopy, we track the structural evolution and migration dynamics during sodium insertion into TiS2 nanostructures with the lattice fringe resolution. We find that the sodiation process of TiS2 is initiated by an intercalation reaction and followed by a conversion reaction. From the same reaction event, the velocity of intercalation/conversion phase boundary migration is found to be ∼1.0-1.7 nm s-1, while the pristine/intercalation phase boundary migrates at a velocity of ∼2.5 nm s-1. The sodium migration leads to structural fracture to form nanometer-sized domains (∼3 nm) with volume expansion. During migration, Na prefers to transport along specific directions. Furthermore, a superstructured Na0.25TiS2 intermediate phase with ordered Na ions occupied within the (0001) plane is formed at the reaction front, which is different from the common staging phase. These findings help us understand the working principle and the failure mechanism of the sodium ion battery and also provide useful insights into the general ionic doping of transition metal dichalcogenides.",

However, the lack of high‐performance electrode materials hinders the wide‐range commercialization of SIBs. Comparing to inorganic counterparts, organic electrode materials, which are benefitted from flexibly designable structures, low cost, environmental friendliness, and high theoretical gravimetric capacities, should be a prior choice. Here, a covalent organic polymer (COP) based material (denoted as CityU‐9) is designed and synthesized by integrating multiple redox motifs (benzoquinone and thioether), improved conductivity (sulfur induction), and intrinsic insolubility (rigid skeleton). The half‐cell SIBs exhibit ultrahigh specific capacity of 1009 mAh g−1 and nearly no capacity drop after 650 cycles. The first all‐COP symmetric full‐cell shows high specific capacity of 90 mAh g−1 and excellent rate capability.

        "abstract": "Ionic liquids (ILs) have been considered as an alternative class of electrolytes compared to conventional carbonate solvents in rechargeable lithium/sodium batteries. However, the drawbacks of ILs are their reducing ionic conductivity and their large viscosity. Therefore, mixtures of alkyl carbonate solvents with an IL and a sodium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide (NaTFSI) have been investigated to develop new electrolytes for sodium‐ion batteries. In this work, N‐Butyl‐N‐methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoro‐methanesulfonyl) imide (Py14TFSI) was used as co‐solvent mixing with commercial electrolytes based on the carbonate, i.e. EC‐PC (1:1), EC‐DMC (1:1), and EC‐PC‐DMC (3:1:1). The addition of ionic liquid in the carbonate‐based electrolyte solution results in (i) enhancing ionic conductivity to be comparable with a solvent‐free IL‐based electrolyte, (ii) maintaining the electrochemical stability window, and (iii) IL acted as a retardant rather than a flame‐inhibitor based on the self‐extinguish time (SET) of the mixed electrolyte mixture when exposed to a free flame. All mixed electrolyte systems have been tested in sodium‐coin cells versus Na0.44MnO2 (NMO) and hard carbon (HC) electrodes. The cells show good performances in charge/discharge cycling with a retention > 96 % after 30 cycles (∼90 mAh.g‐1 for NMO and 180 mAh.g‐1 for HC, respectively) demonstrating good interfacial stability and highly stable discharge capacities.",

        "title": "Theoretical insights into surface-phase transition and ion competition during alkali ion intercalation on the Cu4Se4 nanosheet.",
        "abstract": "The development of stable and efficient electrode materials is imperative and also indispensable for further commercialization of sodium/potassium-ion batteries (SIBs/PIBs) and new detrimental issues such as proton intercalation arise when utilizing aqueous electrolytes. Herein the electrochemical performance of the Cu4Se4 nanosheet was determined for both organic and aqueous SIBs and PIBs. By means of density functional theory calculation, Na+, K+ and H+ intercalations onto both sides of the Cu4Se4 nanosheet were revealed. The Cu4Se4 nanosheet well maintains its metallic electronic conductivity and the changes in lateral lattice parameters are within 4.66% during the whole Na+/K+ intercalation process for both SIBS and PIBs. The theoretical maximum Na/K storage capacity of 188.07 mA h g-1 can be achieved by stabilized second-layer adsorption of Na+/K+. The migration barriers of Na and K atoms on the Cu4Se4 nanosheet are 0.270 and 0.173 eV, respectively. It was discovered that Na/K- intercalation in the first layer is accompanied by a first-order surface phase transition, resulting in an intercalation voltage plateau of 0.659/0.756 V, respectively. The region of the two-surface phase coexistence for PIBs, is shifted toward a lower coverage when compared with that for SIBs. The partially protonated Cu4Se4 nanosheet (HxCu4Se4, x ≤ 10/9) was revealed to be structurally and thermodynamically stable. While the partially protonated Cu4Se4 nanosheet is favorable in acidic electrolytes (pH = 0) when protons and Na/K ions compete, we showed that Na+/K+ intercalated products may be preferred over H+ at low coverages in alkali electrolyte (pH = 14). However, the proton intercalation substantially decreases the battery capacity in aqueous SIBs and PIBs. Our work not only identifies the promising performance of Cu4Se4 nanosheets as an electrode material of SIBs and PIBs, but also provides a computational method for aqueous metal-ion batteries.",

The structural characteristics of AQ and its chemical environment are found to have a substantial influence on its electrochemical performance. Computational investigation for different charged states of AQ on a carbon substrate obtained via basin hopping global minimization provides important insights into the physicochemical thin-film properties. The results reveal the ideal stacking configurations of the individual AQ-carrier systems and show ordering effects in a periodic supercell environment. The latter reveals the transition from intermolecular hydrogen bonding toward the formation of salt bridges between the reduced AQ units and a stabilizing effect upon the dimerlike rearrangement, while the strong surface–molecular interactions in the thin-film geometries are found to be crucial for the formed dimers to remain electronically active. Both characteristics, the improved current collector adhesion and the stabilization due to dimerization, are mutual benefits of thin-film electrodes over powder-based systems. This hypothesis has been further investigated for its potential application in sodium ion batteries. Our results show that AQ thin-film electrodes exhibit significantly better specific capacities (233 vs 87 mAh g–1 in the first cycle), Coulombic efficiencies, and long-term cycling performance (80 vs 4 mAh g–1 after 100 cycles) over the AQ powder electrodes.

With lower temperatures, the smaller particles with more water are formed by predominant nucleation, resulting in low crystallinity and capacity of 58 mAh g -1 . Expanded surface area reduces electrode/electrolyte interface's charge transfer resistanc e and excellent rate capability (79% of initial capacity at 100 C-rate). However, poor cyclability was obtained. At elevated temperatures, the nuclei's growth and dehydration occur, and thus highly crystalline large particles are formed. In turn, NiHCF delivers excellent capacity of 76 mAh g -1 at 1 C-rate but exhibits inferior rate performance because of longer diffusional path. Meanwhile, normal coprecipitation at 70 o C induces irregular-shaped tiny particles, presenting 93% retention of initial capacity at 100 C-rate.",

        "abstract": "Nanostructured copper selenide (Cu2 Se) attracts much interest as it shows outstanding performance as thermoelectric, photo-thermal, and optical material. The mesoporous structure is also a promising morphology to obtain better performance for electrochemical and catalytic applications, thanks to its high surface area. A simple one-step electrochemical method is proposed for mesoporous chalcogenides synthesis. The synthesized Cu2 Se material has two types of mesopores (9 and 18 nm in diameter), which are uniformly distributed inside the flakes. These materials are also implemented for sodium (Na) ion battery (NIB) anode as a proof of concept. The electrode employing the mesoporous Cu2 Se exhibits superior and more stable specific capacity as a NIB anode compared to the non-porous samples. The electrode also exhibits excellent rate tolerance at each current density, from 100 to 1000 mA g-1 . It is suggested that the mesoporous structure is advantageous for the insertion of Na ions inside the flakes. Electrochemical analysis indicates that the mesoporous electrode possesses more prominent diffusion-controlled kinetics during the sodiation-desodiation process, which contributes to the improvement of Na-ion storage performance.",

        "abstract": "Organic-metal coordination materials with rich structural diversity are considered as promising electrode materials for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries. However, the electrochemical performance can be constrained by the limited number of active sites and structural instability under the discharge/charge process. Herein, organometallic polymer microspheres (Fe-PDA-220) with a unique d-π conjugated structure was designed and successfully constructed through a simple synchronous polymerization and coordination reactions. Polymerization of phenylenediamine was initiated by Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions generated synchronously during the polymerization integrated with poly-aminoquinone chains to form Fe-C12N8 active centers. Used as electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries, the distinctive Fe-C bond significantly boosts the structural stability, and the π-d conjugation system could facilitate electron transfer. A high reversible capacity of 345 mAh g-1 was delivered at 0.1 A g-1 and a capacity of 106 mAh g-1 was maintained even after discharged/charged at 1.0 A g-1 for 5000 cycles, outperforming most reported coordination materials. Spectroscopic and electronic analyses revealed that a two-electron reaction occurred per active unit, accompanied by the reversible redox evolution of the C=N groups and Fe ions during  sodiation/desodiation. This work provides a promising and efficient strategy for boosting the electrochemical performance of organic electrode materials by the design of organometallic polymers.",

        "abstract": "Aqueous sodium-ion batteries represent a promising approach for stationary energy storage; however, the lack of appropriate anode materials has substantially retarded their development. Herein, we demonstrated an iron-based phosphate material of Na3Fe3(PO4)4 as an inexpensive and efficacious anode alternative. While the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple renders a two-Na-insertion reaction with desirable potentials, its unique layered structure further facilitates the Na-insertion kinetics and reversibility. Consequently, this electrode exhibits an appealing Na-insertion performance, with a reversible capacity of ∼83 mAh g–1, suitable anode potential of −0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl, excellent rate capability of 200 C, and outstanding cycling of 6000 cycles. Utilizing operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we revealed the structural evolution of the Na3Fe3(PO4)4 anode during the two-electron reaction, where the extremely small volume expansion (∼3%) enables its fast-charging and long-cycling capability. Our work suggests new considerations of developing versatile iron phosphate compounds as appealing anode materials for energy storage in aqueous electrolytes.",

However, related research is limited. In this work, lignite‐derived hard carbons with various particle sizes were investigated as anode materials for SIBs. The electrochemical performance and Na+ diffusion capability were evaluated. The results show that smaller particle sizes in hard carbon anodes lead to reduced mesopore volumes, specific surface areas, and coating densities, which effectively improve cycle stability, initial coulombic efficiency (ICE), and rate capability of the electrode. Specifically, hard carbon anodes within a 1–15 µm particle size distribution exhibited a reversible capacity of 251 mAh g−1 and an ICE of 73.67% at a current density of 25 mA g−1.

Herein, we examine the intercalation properties of novel double sodium nickel-manganese sulfate, Na2Ni1/2Mn1/2(SO4)2, having a large monoclinic unit cell, through electrochemical and ex situ diffraction and spectroscopic methods. The sulfate salt Na2Ni1/2Mn1/2(SO4)2 is prepared by thermal dehydration of the corresponding hydrate salt Na2Ni1/2Mn1/2(SO4)2·4H2O having a blödite structure. The intercalation reactions on Na2Ni1-xMnx(SO4)2 are studied in two model cells: half-ion cell versus Li metal anode and full-ion cell versus Li4Ti5O12 anode by using lithium (LiPF6 dissolved in EC/DMC) and sodium electrolytes (NaPF6 dissolved in EC:DEC). Based on ex situ XRD and TEM analysis, it is found that sodium intercalation into Na2Ni1/2Mn1/2(SO4)2 takes place via phase separation into the Ni-rich monoclinic phase and Mn-rich alluaudite phase. The redox reactions involving participation of manganese and titanium ions are monitored by ex situ EPR spectroscopy. It has been demonstrated that manganese ions from the sulfate salt are participating in the electrochemical reaction, while the nickel ions remain intact. As a result, a reversible capacity of about 65 mA h g-1 is reached. The selective intercalation properties determine sodium nickel-manganese sulfate as a new electrode material for hybrid lithium-sodium ion batteries that is thought to combine the advantages of individual lithium and sodium batteries.",

However, performance enhancement is often attributed to the unclear synergistic effects among the active components. A comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanisms on the interfaces at the atomic level remains elusive. Herein, the carbon‐coated Fe3Se4/CoSe (Fe3Se4/CoSe‐C) anode material as a model featuring atomic‐scale contact interfaces is synthesized. This unique heterogeneous architecture offers an adjustable electronic structure, which facilitates rapid reaction kinetics and enhances structural integrity. In situ microscopic and ex situ spectral characterization techniques, along with theoretical simulations, confirm that the heterointerface with strong electric fields promotes Na+ ion migration. Based on solid‐state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, an interface charge storage mechanism is revealed, resulting in the enhanced specific capacity of the anode materials. When employed as an anode in SIBs, the Fe3Se4/CoSe‐C electrode demonstrates excellent rate capabilities (218 mAh g−1 at 7 A g−1) and prolonged cycling stability (258 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1 after 1000 cycles).

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries are currently being investigated as an attractive substitute for lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries in large energy storage systems because of the more abundant and less expensive supply of Na than Li. However, the reversible capacity of Na-ions is limited because Na possesses a large ionic radius and has a higher standard electrode potential than that of Li, making it challenging to obtain electrode materials that are capable of storing large quantities of Na-ions. This study investigates the potential of CoFe2O4 synthesised via the molten salt method as an anode for Na-ion batteries. The obtained phase structure, morphology and charge and discharge properties of CoFe2O4 are thoroughly assessed. The synthesised CoFe2O4 has an octahedron morphology, with a particle size in the range of 1.1–3.6 μm and a crystallite size of ∼26 nm. Moreover, the CoFe2O4 (M800) electrodes can deliver a high discharge capacity of 839 mA h g−1 in the first cycle at a current density of 0.1 A g−1, reasonable cyclability of 98 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles and coulombic efficiency of ∼99%. The improved electrochemical performances of CoFe2O4 can be due to Na-ion-pathway shortening, wherein the homogeneity and small size of CoFe2O4 particles may enhance the Na-ion transportation. Therefore, this simple synthetic approach using molten salt favours the Na-ion diffusion and electron transport to a great extent and maximises the utilisation of CoFe2O4 as a potential anode material for Na-ion batteries.",

TAPQ cycled in diglyme-based electrolyte exhibits superior electrochemical performance, but experiences a rapid capacity fading in carbonate-based electrolyte.

        "abstract": "The development of high-performance sodium (Na) ion batteries requires improved electrode materials. The energy and power densities of Na superionic conductor (NaSICON) electrode materials are promising for large-scale energy storage applications. However, several practical issues limit the full utilization of the theoretical energy densities of NaSICON electrodes. A pressing challenge lies in the limited sodium extraction in low Na content NaSICONs, e.g., $\\rm Na_1V^{IV}V^{IV}(PO_4)_3 \\leftrightarrow V^{V}V^{IV}(PO_4)_3 + 1e^- + 1Na^+$. Hence, it is important to quantify the Na-ion mobility in a broad range of NaSICON electrodes. Using a kinetic Monte Carlo approach bearing the accuracy of first-principles calculations, we elucidate the variability of Na-ion transport vs. Na content in three important NaSICON electrodes, Na$_{\\rm x}$Ti$_{2}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{3}$, Na$_{\\rm x}$V$_{2}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{3}$, and Na$_{\\rm x}$Cr$_{2}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{3}$. Our study suggests that Na$^+$ transport in NaSICON electrodes is almost entirely determined by the local electrostatic and chemical environment set by the transition metal and the polyanionic scaffold. The competition with the ordering-disordering phenomena of Na-vacancies also plays a role in influencing Na-transport. We link the variations in the Na$^+$ kinetic properties by analyzing the competition of ligand field stabilization transition metal ions and their ionic radii. We interpret the limited Na-extraction at $x = 1$ observed experimentally by gaining insights into the local Na-vacancy interplay. We propose that targeted chemical substitutions of transition metals disrupting local charge arrangements will be critical to reducing the occurrence of strong Na$^+$-vacancy orderings at low Na concentrations, thus, expanding the accessible capacities of these electrode materials.",

However, the microcrystal structure of carbon plays a decisive role in the energy storage performance, and therefore, it should be adjusted when applied to different EESs. Here, a hierarchical porous carbon monomer monolith (HPCM) embedded with carbon nanotubes blooming on ZIF-67 was designed as a soft-hard carbon-based freestanding thick electrode for achieving high-energy lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries. HPCM is resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) resin-derived carbon, mainly composed of hard carbon, which has outstanding mechanical properties, a high surface area, and high porosity. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) derived from ZIF-67 have extraordinary electronic conductivity, which provides soft carbon. High-temperature CO2 etching was performed to adjust the microcrystal structure, and the lithium/sodium storage performance of the electrode was evaluated. After CO2 etching, the materials lose almost half their weight (mainly hard carbon), and pseudocapacitive contribution decreases for both lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries, whereas the specific capacity increases for lithium-ion batteries and decreases for sodium-ion batteries. Capacities of 5.96 mAh cm-2 (areal) and 132.48 mAh cm-3 (volumetric) were achieved for lithium storage, and those for sodium storage were 2.31 and 51.24 mAh cm-3, respectively.

        "abstract": "Abstract Practical aqueous zinc‐ion batteries require low‐cost thin zinc anodes with long‐term reversible stripping/depositing. However, thin zinc anodes encounter more severe issues than thick zinc, such as dendrites and uneven stripping, resulting in subpar performance and limited lifetimes. Here, this work proposes a three‐in‐one zinc anode obtained by a large‐scale two‐step method to address the above issues. In a three‐in‐one zinc anode, the copper foil as an inactive current collector solves the gradual reduction of the active area when only the pure zinc as an active current collector. This work develops an automatic electroplating device that can continuously deposit a zinc layer on a conducting foil to meet the demand for zinc‐coated copper foils. The sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)‐zinc fluoride (ZnF2) protective layer prevents direct contact between zinc and separator, and provides a uniform and sufficient supply of zinc ions. The CMC‐ZnF2‐coated copper foil performs up to 3000 reversible zinc deposition/stripping cycles with a cumulative capacity of 6 Ah cm−2 and an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.94%. The Zn||ZnVO cell using the three‐in‐one anode achieved a high capacity retention of over 70% after 15 000 cycles. The proposed three‐in‐one anode and the automatic electroplating device will facilitate industrialization of practical thin zinc anodes.",

        "abstract": "Nanosized SnO2 particles (∼2 nm in diameter) are embedded in ordered mesoporous CMK-8 carbon with unique three-dimensional interconnected pore channels and used as a sodium-ion battery (NIB) anode. Due to the CMK-8 confinement effects, the growth of SnO2 is suppressed during synthesis, leading to high material electroactivity. The CMK-8 not only serves as an electronic conducting pathway, but also creates interpenetrating tunnels, which guarantee electrolyte accessibility and thus Na+ transport throughout the electrode. Moreover, the change in the SnO2 volume during sodiation/desodiation can be accommodated by the CMK-8 framework. With a high tap density of ∼1000 mg cm-3 (vs. ∼800 mg cm-3 for the conventional NIB anode, hard carbon), the SnO2/CMK-8 anode shows a high reversible capacity of 800 mA h g-1 and excellent rate capability, delivering 330 mA h g-1 in ∼10 min. The electrode charge storage mechanism is examined using synchrotron X-ray diffraction. We confirm that CMK-8 incorporation can effectively promote the SnO2-Sn conversion reaction and Sn-Na alloying reaction, which are known to be thermodynamically/kinetically difficult, increasing the electrode charge-discharge performance.",

        "abstract": "Transition-metal diselenides have been extensively studied as desirable anode candidates for both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of their high theoretical capacities. However, it is of great challenge to achieve satisfactory cycling performance, especially for larger sodium ion storage, originated from electrode deterioration upon large volume change. Herein, we reported the construction of hierarchical tubular hybrid nanostructures through encapsulating CoSe2 nanoparticles into MoSe2/C composite shells via a simple two-step strategy including a hydrothermal method followed by vapor-phase selenization process. The unique tubular structure enables the highly reversible Li/Na storage with high specific capacity, enhanced cycling stability, and superior rate performance. It is indicated that the contribution of partial pseudocapacitive behavior greatly improves the rate capability for SIBs, where a high capacity retention of 81.5% can be obtained when the current densities range from 0.1 to 3 A g-1 (460 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 vs 379 mA h g-1 at 3 A g-1). This work provides an effective design rationale on transition-metal diselenide-based tubular nanostructures as superior hosts for both Li and Na ions, which could push forward the development of practical applications of transition-metal diselenide-based anodes in LIBs and SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfides are emerging as promising anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high theoretical capacity and low cost, their practical application yet face critical issues of sluggish kinetics and poor cycling stability. In this study, a reliable approach is introduced to overcome these challenges by fabrication of Se0.75‐Fe1‐xS0.25@SC hollow nanospheres thanks to the enriched robust Fe─S─C, C─S, and C─Se bonding, which greatly benefit for enhancing both reaction kinetics and structural stability. Kinetic study combining with in situ characterization reveals that the incorporation of rich‐Se into FeSx induces the formation of cationic Fe and Se vacancies, leading to abundant sites and optimized path for sodium storage. Density functional theory calculations also demonstrate how Se‐rich engineering weakens carbonaceous polar C─S─Fe bonds and accelerates reaction dynamics. The as‐prepared Se0.75‐Fe1‐xS0.25@SC can deliver a high reversible capacity of 515 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 over 1250 cycles and achieve superior rate capability with maintaining capacity of 418 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have been one of the most promising alternatives for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for large-scale energy storage systems due to cost-efficiency and rich resources of sodium. However, graphite, a commercial anode material of LIBs, shows a very low reversible capacity for sodium-ion storage because of the weak binding between sodium and graphite. Herein, an activated graphite (AG) material with abundant defects including edges and vacancies with oxygenic functional groups is well-designed and fabricated by a facile and eco-friendly ball-milling method. The structural evolutions during the ball-milling process and their effects on electrochemical sodium-ion storage performance are investigated. A stable reversible capacity of 139.1 mA h g-1 can be achieved at 1.0 A g-1 even after 4500 cycles for the AG-50 electrode with the 50-hour ball-milling treatment, amounting to a very low decay ratio of 0.0034% per cycle. Based on physical characterizations and density functional theory calculations, the greatly improved specific capacity and cycling stability of the AG anode for sodium-ion storage can be attributed to the enlarged interlayer space, increased specific surface area, and introduced defects caused by ball-milling treatment, which provide vast active sites for reversible sodium-ion storage based on a adsorption/desorption mechanism, thus leading to great improvement in the specific capacity of the AG electrode. These results can provide a meaningful reference for the application of modified graphite for high-performance sodium storage.",

        "abstract": "To achieve the high‐power sodium‐ion batteries, the solid‐state ion diffusion in the electrode materials is a highly concerned issue and needs to be solved. In this study, a simple and effective strategy is reported to weaken and degrade this process by engineering the intensified surface and near‐surface reactions, which is realized by making use of a sandwich‐type nanoarchitecture composed of graphene as electron channels and few‐layered MoS2 with expanded interlayer spacing. The unique 2D sheet‐shaped hierarchical structure is capable of shortening the ion diffusion length, while the few‐layered MoS2 with expanded interlayer spacing has more accessible surface area and the decreased ion diffusion resistance, evidenced by the smaller energy barriers revealed by the density functional theory calculations. Benefiting from the shortened ion diffusion distance and enhanced electron transfer capability, a high ratio of surface or near‐surface reactions is dominated at a high discharge/charge rate. As such, the composites exhibit the high capacities of 152 and 93 mA h g−1 at 30 and 50 A g−1, respectively. Moreover, a high reversible capacity of 684 mA h g−1 and an excellent cycling stability up to 4500 cycles can be delivered.

In addition, metal electrodes provide opportunities for fundamental research of different phenomena, such as ion transport and electrochemical kinetics, in the complex environment of reactive metal‐electrodeposition. In this work, computationally and experimentally the competing effects related to transport and kinetics during the metal electrodeposition process are examined. Using Brownian dynamics simulations, it is shown that slower deposition kinetics results in a more compact and uniform Li morphology. This finding is experimentally implemented by designing ion‐containing polymeric coatings on the electrodes that simultaneously provide pathways for lithium‐ion transport, while impeding the charge transfer (Li+ + e− → Li) at heterogeneous surfaces. It is further shown that these ionic polymer interfaces can significantly extend the cell‐lifetime of a lithium metal battery in both ether‐based and carbonate‐based electrolytes. Through theoretical and experimental investigations, it is found that a low kinetic to transport rate ratio is a major factor in influencing the Li plating morphology. The plating morphology can be further fine‐tuned by increasing ionic conductivity.",

Herein, a novel flexible symmetric Na-ion microbattery based on the heteronanomat electrode and the biocompatible electrolyte has been developed. The film electrodes with sphere-in-network architecture are synthesized by simultaneously electrospinning and electrospraying followed by carbonization. The combined technologies allow a uniform incorporation of active materials/C spheres into the carbon nanofiber matrix, which results in the heteronanomat electrodes with robust structure, fast electron/ion transport, and compact mass loading. The flexible microbatteries are fabricated based on the interdigitated microelectrodes and the biocompatible electrolytes, which provides a new implantable power source for bioelectronics. As a proof-of-concept study, the symmetric sodium-ion microbatteries are constructed from the heteronanomat bifunctional electrodes (based on Na2VTi(PO4)3) and the biocompatible electrolyte. The high reversibility, fast kinetics, and high energy density of the symmetric system in the biocompatible electrolytes reveal their superior performance in bioenvironments. Moreover, the high capacity retention (over 98%) and the high stability of microbattery implanted in a living SD rat for a month further demonstrate its high reliability for long-term in vivo diagnosis.

Cr2 Se3 exhibits spontaneous antiparallel alignment of magnetic moments. Mo2+ doping is employed to regulate the electron spin states of Cr2 Se3 . Moreover, the MoSe2 and Cr2 Se3 heterojunctions induce a lattice mismatch at the heterostructure interface, resulting in spin-polarized states or localized magnetic moments at the interface, potentially contributing to spin-polarized surface capacitance. MoSe2 /Cr2 Se3 @N-HCSs demonstrate a high capacity of 498 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 with good cycling stability (capacity of 405 mAh g-1 and a coulombic efficiency of 99.8% after 1000 cycles). Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations simulate the accumulation of spin-polarized charges at the MoSe2 /Cr2 Se3 @N-HCSs heterojunction interface, dependent on the surface electron density of the antiferromagnetic Cr2 Se3 and the surface spin polarization near the Fermi level. After regulating the electron spin states through Mo-doping, the band gap of the material decreases. These significant findings provide novel insights into the design and synthesis of electrode materials with exceptional performance characteristics for batteries.",

        "abstract": "Due to their low cost and easy synthesis method, several kinds of sodium titanates have been explored as anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). However, some of them have not yet been considered as electrode materials for SIBs, and here we have carried out a first-principles study on NaxTi2O4 compounds with two different tunnel structures, denoted as single and double phases, to demonstrate their structural and electrochemical properties upon Na or Li insertion. Our calculation results reveal that these compounds exhibit structural stability during sodiation/desodiation and a moderate electrode voltage of ∼0.82 V vs. Na+/Na with a specific capacity of ∼150 mA h g-1. In particular, the activation energy of Na+ ion migration in the double phase is estimated to be as low as 0.28 eV, which is the lowest value among the SIB electrodes developed so far, and this can be attributed to the wide tunnel structure. In addition, we verify their potentiality for use as anode materials in lithium ion batteries (LIBs) by exploring their properties upon Li insertion. Since these compounds are predicted to be promising anode materials for SIBs or LIBs by our calculations, we believe that our findings will promote further experimental studies.",

However, how to produce hard carbon anodes at a low cost for the preparation of energy storage materials requires continuous exploration and experimentation to find the optimal solution. Here, we used waste sour date shell biomass as a precursor for a hard carbon anode obtained by simple acid treatment and two pyrolyses. It is shown that acid washing after prepyrolysis has a significant effect on the electrochemical performance of the sour date shell-derived hard carbon (ZJ), constructing a stable structure that makes it easier for sodium ions to be embedded and dislodged, and the carbon particles are homogeneous and free of bonding and electrode cracking. The ZJ-1500-HCl pyrolyzed at 1500 °C has a high reversible capacity of 329.1 mAh g-1, 94.1% initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), 90.54% capacity retention efficiency cycling 300 cycles at a current density of 300 mA g-1, and a resistivity below 10 Ω.

Herein, the structurally distorted high-quality monoclinic NaFeHCF with fewer defects in the framework was synthesized by a crystal-controlled coprecipitation method via tuning the crystallization reaction conditions and applied to seawater desalination. Physicochemical characterization and desalination experiments show that the NFHFC-2 with minimized defects possesses enhanced electrochemical activity of Fe2+ and electrochemical kinetics, thus achieving higher desalination performance (specific capacity of 75.0 mA h g-1 and capacity retention of 85.3% after 50 cycles). Furthermore, a symmetrical NFHCF-2 RCDB is assembled, and the operation parameters (including various salinities and electrode spacing) are optimized to achieve a remarkable salt removal capacity (SRC) of 108.9 mg g-1 and a salt removal rate (SRR) of 2.22 mg g-1 min-1 with low energy consumption (0.056 kW h kg-1-NaCl) and outstanding cycling stability (almost no capacity attenuation in 150 cycles). Impressively, the RCDB further exhibits favorable technical feasibility in the simultaneous removal of univalent/bivalent ions from the natural seawater.

It is found that tailoring the stoichiometry using the sodium/manganese ratio and fluorine content in the synthesis can improve the electrochemical performance and achieve high capacity and superb cycling stability.

However, the uncontrolled growth of Na (K) dendrites severely damages the stability of the electrode/electrolyte interface, resulting in battery failure. Herein, a heterogeneous interface layer consisting of metal vanadium nanoparticles and sodium sulfide (potassium sulfide) is introduced on the surface of a Na (K) foil (i.e., Na2S/V/Na or K2S/V/K).

The optimized carbon-free Sn-Bi compositions, benefiting from the combined effects of \"buffering\" action and faster Na transport of Bi, to go with the greater Na-storage capacity and lower operating potential of Sn, exhibit excellent cyclic stability (viz., ∼83-92% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 1C) and rate capability (viz., no capacity drop from C/5 to 2C, with only ∼25% drop at 5C), despite having fairly coarse particles (∼5-10 μm). As proven by operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction and stress measurements, the sequential sodiation/desodiation of the components and, concomitantly, stress build-ups at different potentials provide \"buffering\" action even for such \"active-active\" Sn-Bi compositions. Furthermore, the overall stress development upon sodiation of Bi has been found to be significantly lower than that of Sn (by a factor of ∼3.8), which renders Bi promising as a \"buffer\" material, in general. Dissemination of such complex interplay between electrode-active components during electrochemical cycling also paves the way for the development of high-performance, safe, and scalable \"alloying-reaction\"-based anode materials for Na-ion batteries and beyond, sans the need for ultrafine/nanoscaled electrode particles or \"inactive\" nanoscaled-carbon-based \"buffer\" materials.",

        "abstract": "A light- and magnetic stimuli-responsive MoS2 composite electrode material is designed and evaluated as an anode material of sodium ion batteries. Through the assistance of simulated sunlight, suppressed dendritic sodium growth, buffered volume deformation, promoted electrochemical reaction kinetics, and improved structural stability are simultaneously achieved. Meanwhile, ferroelectric polarization enhances the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers. The collisions among electrons are dramatically decreased; in turn, the thermal stability of the battery is improved via the tailored orientation of active materials. A stable protective solid-state electrolyte interface film is formed via the photogenerated electrons and the magnetohydrodynamics effect, depressing the growth of sodium dendrites. The porous three-dimensional heterostructure is conducive for promoting transmission of charges and the diffusion of ions, effectively reducing the local current density of metals, further inhibiting the growth of sodium dendrites during deposition and peeling processes. Density functional theoretical calculations also verify that the fabricated MoS2 composite possesses intensified electron density, and exhibits fast reaction kinetics in repeated cycles and lowered sodium adsorption energy. The optical field and the rational magnetic fabrication technology can fundamentally solve the bottleneck problems restricting the development of batteries, mitigating the energy crisis.",

Benefiting from the synergetic effect of ultrasmall CuCo2 O4 nanoparticles and a tailored N-doped carbon matrix, the 3-CCO@C composite exhibits high cycling stability (capacity of 314 mA h g-1 at 1000 mA g-1 after 1000 cycles) and high rate capability (296 mA h g-1 , even at 5000 mA g-1 ). Significantly, the Na storage mechanism is systematically explored, demonstrating that the irreversible reaction of CuCo2 O4 , which decomposes to Cu and Co, happens in the first discharge process, and then a reversible reaction between metallic Cu/Co and CuO/Co3 O4 occurrs during the following cycles.

        "abstract": "Emerging sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have aroused great attention in large-scale energy storage. However, it is still a great challenge to develop suitable electrode materials due to the large radius of Na+. This work demonstrates a strategy to synthesize hierarchical tubular MoS2 via a facial hydrothermal method with the assistance of tetramethylammonium bromide (TMAB). The results show that sufficient amounts of TMA+ ions are necessary to form the hierarchical tubular structures of MoS2. The obtained tubular MoS2 displays a high diffusion coefficient of Na+ ions, a high specific capacity of 652.5 mAh/g at the current density of 100 mA/g after 50 cycles, and a good cycling stability (94.2% of the initial capacity can be retained after 100 cycles at 1000 mA/g). In situ XRD during the discharge/charge process displays a reversible intercalation/deintercalation of Na+ into MoS2 layers followed by a conversion-type reaction. Systematic analyses reveal that the enhanced electrochemical performance is attributed to its tubular hierarchical structures with the wall composed of loosely stacked nanosheets, which can provide nearly unobstructed ion transportation paths, sufficient active sites, and enough space to mitigate the effects of the volume change during the discharge/charge process. This synthetic approach can be easily extended to other metal oxides and metal sulfides with hierarchical structures for versatile applications.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been regarded as a promising substitute for lithium-ion batteries but there are still formidable challenges in developing an anode material with adequate lifespan and outstanding rate performance. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising anode materials for SIBs due to their high theoretical capacities. However, their severe volume expansions and low electronic conductivity impede their practical developments. In addition, the synthesis of energy storage materials from waste biomass has aroused extensive attention. Herein, we synthesize WS2 nanocrystals embedded in N and P co-doped biochar via a facile bio-sorption followed by sulphurization, employing waste chlorella as the adsorbent and bio-reactor. The WS2 nanocrystals are beneficial for storing more sodium ions and expediting the transportation of sodium ions, thus improving the capacity and reaction kinetics. Chlorella acts as a reactor and not only inhibits the stacking of WS2 nanocrystals during the synthesis process but also alleviates the mechanical pressure of composite during the charge/discharge process. As a result, the WS2/NPC-2 electrode delivers a high specific capacity (436 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1) and superior rate performance of 311 mA h g-1 at 3 A g-1 for SIBs. It also exhibits excellent stability even up to 6000 cycles at 5 A g-1, which is one of the optimal long-cycle properties reported for WS2-based materials to date.",

        "abstract": "Electron transfer plays a crucial role in energy storage materials, such as metal-ion batteries (MIBs). Numerous approaches have been developed to facilitate the electron transfer for MIBs, and most of them extend the special surface areas, which promotes the contact between metal ions and the electrodes. Herein, we report the formation of intramolecular channels for electron transfer to open and close intermolecular channels in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) through functionalization, modulating the cell performance of two-dimensional (2D) nitrogenated holey graphene C2N anodes. This also activates the inactive metal ions in the anodes, reducing their production costs. Upon increasing the concentration of hydrogen atoms, the intramolecular electron transfer increases, lowering the intermolecular electron transfer between C2N and metal ions and thus weakening their interaction and reducing the capacities of the anodes. A high concentration of hydrogen atoms introduced in C2N would further promote the intramolecular electron transfer and block the channels for intermolecular electron transfer. For functionalized C2N monolayers that can be used as anodes in SIBs, they possess high specific capacities, high conductivities, and low open-circuit voltages. This work proposes the fabrication of 2D energy storage materials with tunable macroscale behaviors (e.g., performance) through the relationships between the macroscale and microscale levels and between intramolecular and intermolecular electron transfer.",

        "abstract": "The lack of anodes stability is one among key barriers to the widespread commercialization of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). This is attributed to graphite, a well‐known common anode material for a range of commercial batteries including lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), which limits the insertion of sodium (Na) ions due to their large ionic size. Tin (Sn) has shown its potential as a suitable anode material because it exhibits high capacities in conversion and alloying reactions. However, it endures significant volumetric expansion and slower reaction rates during sodiation. To overcome these challenges, this work presents a novel anode material for SIBs where a 2D layered architecture of Sn with a hard carbon (HC) buffer layer is engineered using physical vapor deposition technique. This novel anode (SnHT/HC) exhibits a high initial capacity of 470 mAhg−1 and an exceptional retention of 438 mAhg−1 after 3000 cycles at 0.2C, with 99 % Coulombic efficiency. SnHT/HC testing at varying fast charge and discharge C‐rate of 5C, 10C, 15C, and 50C has shown promising results. Better electron transport and reduced volumetric changes are perceived to enhance the overall performance of SnHT/HC electrodes.",

As anode in LIB, it delivers 830 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 current density after 250 cycles.

The obtained PTCDA-Na active substance has a porous honeycomb structure, showing a large specific surface area. Moreover, after recombination with graphene, the dispersion and specific surface area of PTCDA-Na are further enhanced, and more active sites are exposed and conductivity is improved. As a result, the PTCDA-Na-G composite electrode materials exhibit superior electrochemical energy storage behaviors. The initial charge capacity of the PTCDA-Na-G electrode is 890.5 mA h g−1, and after 200 cycles, the capacity can still remain at 840.0 mA h g−1 with a high retention rate of 94.3%, which is much larger than those of the PTCDA-Na electrode. In addition, at different current densities, the PTCDA-Na-G electrode also presents higher capacities and better cycle stability than the PTCDA-Na electrode. Compared with PTCDA-Na with a porous honeycomb structure and previously reported sodium carboxylic acid salts with a large size bulk structure, the PTCDA-Na-G composite material prepared in this work shows superior electrochemical energy storage properties due to its large specific surface area, high dispersion, more exposed active sites and large electrical conductivity, which would provide new ideas for the development of high performance organic electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries.",

A heterostructure composed of In2S3 and Sb2S3 shows a unique morphology of formicary microspheres, which provide abundant channels for fast transfer of sodium ions, large surface area for a high pseudocapacitance effect, and enough voids to relieve volume expansion.

During sodiation/desodiation, the synergistic effect of In2S3 and Sb2S3 enhances electronic conductivity and supports the host structure, preventing collapse. The cycling performance and rate performance of the In2S3–Sb2S3 anode are further improved by wrapping the electrode with carbon nanotubes.

        "abstract": "Beyond‐lithium‐ion storage devices are promising alternatives to lithium‐ion storage devices for low‐cost and large‐scale applications. Nowadays, the most of high‐capacity electrodes are crystal materials. However, these crystal materials with intrinsic anisotropy feature generally suffer from lattice strain and structure pulverization during the electrochemical process. Herein, a 2D heterostructure of amorphous molybdenum sulfide (MoS3) on reduced graphene surface (denoted as MoS3‐on‐rGO), which exhibits low strain and fast reaction kinetics for beyond‐lithium‐ions (Na+, K+, Zn2+) storage is demonstrated. Benefiting from the low volume expansion and small sodiation strain of the MoS3‐on‐rGO, it displays ultralong cycling performance of 40 000 cycles at 10 A g−1 for sodium‐ion batteries. Furthermore, the as‐constructed 2D heterostructure also delivers superior electrochemical performance when used in Na+ full batteries, solid‐state sodium batteries, K+ batteries, Zn2+ batteries and hybrid supercapacitors, demonstrating its excellent application prospect.",

Herein, we report the first use of highly porous azo-linked polymers (ALPs) as a new redox-active electrode material for rechargeable sodium ion batteries. ALPs are highly cross-linked polymers and therefore eliminate the solubility issue of organic electrodes in common electrolytes, which is prominent in small organic molecules and leads to fast capacity fading. Moreover, the high surface area coupled with the π-conjugated microporous nature of ALPs facilitates electrolyte adsorption in the pores and assists in fast ionic transport and charge transfer rates. An average specific capacity of 170 mA h g-1 at 0.3 C rate was attained while maintaining 96% coulombic efficiency over 150 charge/discharge cycles.",

        "abstract": "Spinel lithium titanate (LTO; Li4Ti5O12) is one of the promising materials for negative electrodes of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The stable charge-discharge performance of SIB cells using LTO electrodes depends on the reversible Na insertion-extraction mechanism of LTO, where the spinel lattice is expanded with Na insertion, and two phases, Na-inserted LTO (Na-LTO) and Li-inserted LTO (Li-LTO) phases, are generated. These phases are confirmed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), while the mechanism of the two-phase coexistence with different lattice volumes is yet unclear. Here, we investigate the detailed morphology of the coexisting Na-LTO and Li-LTO phases using in situ XRD measurements and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation. Na-LTO (a = 8.74 Å) and Li-LTO (a = 8.36 Å) phases are confirmed in both the electrochemically formed Na-inserted LTO electrode and the single-crystalline LTO thin specimen. We observed that the Na-LTO/Li-LTO interface is parallel to the (001) plane, and contains an inevitable lattice mismatch along the interface, while the expansion of the Na-LTO phase can be partially relaxed normal to the interface. We observed that the Na-LTO/Li-LTO interface has interface layers of lattice disordering with a 1-2 nm width, relaxing the lattice mismatch, as opposed to results from the previous scanning TEM observation. How the different lattice volumes at the two-phase interface are relaxed should be the key issue in investigation of the mechanism of Na insertion and extraction in LTO electrodes.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have increasingly been considered as an attractive alternative to lithium-ion batteries for large-scale applications. High specific capacity and suitable working potential anode materials are one of the keys to search for future developments. Here, a novel and stable sodium titanate/carbon-black phosphorus (NTO/C-BP) hybrids are first fabricated as a promising anode material for advanced sodium-ion batteries. Under the protection of argon (Ar) atmosphere, the direct high-energy mechanical milling of the BP nanoparticle and NTO/C results in the formation of NTO/C-BP hybrids. In other words, the BP nanoparticle can be interconnected with bare NTO by P-O-Ti bonds and/or form stable P-C bonds with the carbon coating layer on the surface of NTO. The NTO/C-BP hybrids are not only beneficial for enhancing specific capacity but also have a great protective effect on the exposure of BP to air by the synergistic effect between BP and NTO/C. The results show that the NTO/C-BP hybrids can deliver very high specific capacity (∼225 mA h g-1 after 55 cycles at 20 mA g-1, ∼183 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g-1). It is expected from these scientific findings that forming stable P-C bonds and P-O-Ti bonds in this work can serve as a guidance to other Ti-based and P-based electrode materials for practical large-scale application of sodium-ion batteries.",

In this system, sodium ions and anions are captured/released by the metal oxide and carbon electrodes, respectively. The hybrid Capmix extracted an energy density that was approximately three times higher (130 J m-2 ) and exhibited a notable power output (97 mW m-2 ) compared to the previous Capmix using ion-exchange membranes. Furthermore, the hybrid system operated successfully with real river water and seawater.

However, designing a high-rate Cu3P electrode with long durability is still faced with huge challenges. Here, we report a self-supporting three-dimensional (3D) composite of Cu3P and Co2P interconnected by N-doped C fibers (Cu3P-Co2P/N-C). The advanced 3D structure not only provides fast reaction kinetics but also improves the structural stability, leading to excellent rate capability and long-term cycling stability, and pseudocapacitance behavior is also beneficial to the high rate performance. Additionally, the synergistic effects between Cu3P, Co2P, and N-doped carbon can increase the electrical conductivity and active sites, ensuring more ion storage. The Cu3P-Co2P/N-C anode for lithium-ion batteries delivers high discharge capacity, superior rate performance, and ultralong lifespan over 2000 cycles accompanied by a stable capacity of around 316.9 mAh/g at 5 A/g. When the 3D structured material works in sodium-ion batteries, it also displays improved electrochemical performance.

In this work, zinc ferrite (ZnFe2O4) nanospheres have been prepared by the simple hydrothermal route and the structural analysis of ZnFe2O4 was evaluated by using X-ray diffraction. The morphology and microstructural characterizations are obtained using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The results indicate that a single phase material was obtained with uniform sphere-like morphology and high crystallinity. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method was employed to determine the specific surface area of the ZnFe2O4 nanospheres which has been calculated to be 32 m2 g−1. The electrochemical results indicate that the composite possesses high sodium storage capability (478 mA h g−1), and good cycling stability (284 mA h g−1 at 100th cycle) and rate capability (78 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1). The high sodium storage performance of the ZnFe2O4 electrode is ascribed to the mesoporous nature of the ZnFe2O4 nanospheres. Further, sodium kinetics and the reaction mechanism in ZnFe2O4 nanospheres have been elucidated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, ex situ TEM, and XAS. The acquired results indicate sluggish kinetics, reversibility of the material, and the stable structure of ZnFe2O4.

        "abstract": "Disordered carbons are promising anode materials for sodium ion batteries. However, a major drawback of these materials is their low Coulombic efficiency in the first cycles, which indicates parasitic reactions. Such reactions can be supressed by alumina coating on the surface of the anodic materials; more ions are then available for electrochemical activity, and less electrolyte solution is lost. On the other hand, some pores and surface edge sites are passivated by the coating and are no longer available for reversible reaction with sodium ions, hence their contribution is eliminated, leading to reduction in specific capacity. We show herein that electrochemical insertion of sodium ions into carbon anodes prior to alumina coating has double positive effect on anode perfomances, meaning, preventing passivation and maintaining high specific capacity. We show that the artificial layer still prevented parasitic reactions, while the pores and surface edge sites retained electrochemical activity. The capacity values were thus restored and even became higher due to preventing the development of a surface layer. UPS measurements assessed the energetic states of the electrodes and confirmed that the alumina coating forms a barrier for interfacial electron transfer from the electrode to the solution at any polarization stage.",

In light of its high capacity and fast charging-discharging performance, Sc2 C exhibits significant potential as an anode material for lithium- and sodium-ion batteries. Herein, a systematic investigation of Li/Na atom adsorption and diffusion on Sc2 C planes was performed based on density functional calculations. The metallic character of pristine and adsorbed Sc2 C ensures desirable electric conductivity, which indicates the advantages of 2D Sc2 C for lithium- and sodium-ion batteries. A significant charge transfer from the Li/Na atoms to Sc2 C is predicted, which indicates the cationic state of the adatoms. In addition, the diffusion barriers are as low as 0.018 and 0.012 eV for Li and Na, respectively, which illustrates the high mobility and cycling ability of Sc2 C. In particular, each formula unit of Sc2 C can adsorb up to two Li/Na atoms, which corresponds to a relatively high theoretical capacity of 462 or 362 mAh g-1 . The average electrode potential was calculated to be as low as 0.32 and 0.24 V for stoichiometric Li2 Sc2 C and Na2 Sc2 C, respectively, which makes Sc2 C attractive for the overall voltage of the cell.

Importantly, the ultra‐small superparamagnetic Fe nanoparticles (≈2 nm) can induce a strong spin‐polarized surface capacitance effect at operating temperatures ranging from −40 to 60 °C, thus achieving highly efficient Na‐ion transport and storage in a wide operation‐temperature range. Consequently, the Fe3O4/C@G anode shows high capacity, excellent fast‐charging capability, and cycling stability ranging from −40 to 60 °C in half/full cells. This work demonstrates the viability of Fe3O4 as anode for wide operation‐temperature SIBs and reveals that spin‐polarized surface capacitance effects can promote Na‐ion storage over a wide operation temperature range.",

        "abstract": "We report the application of disordered 3 D multi-layer graphene, synthesized directly from CO2 gas through a reaction with Li at 550 °C, as an anode for Na-ion batteries (SIBs) toward a sustainable and greener future. The material exhibited a reversible capacity of ∼190 mA h g(-1) with a Coulombic efficiency of 98.5 % at a current density of 15 mA g(-1) . The discharge capacity at higher potentials (>0.2 V vs. Na/Na(+) ) is ascribed to Na-ion adsorption at defect sites, whereas the capacity at low potentials (<0.2 V) is ascribed to intercalation between graphene sheets through electrochemical characterization, Raman spectroscopy, and small-angle X-ray scattering experiments. The disordered multi-layer graphene electrode demonstrated a great rate capability and cyclability. This novel approach to synthesize disordered 3 D multi-layer graphene from CO2 gas makes it attractive not only as an anode material for SIBs but also to mitigate CO2 emission.",

        "abstract": "Metal sulfides, one kind of electrode material with very high theoretical capacity, have been widely studied for use in lithium and sodium ion batteries. However, there are some problems hindering their applications in electrodes, such as low conductivity and volume expansion. The MOF introduces metals with different coordination strengths into an existing MOF structure, which improves the performance of the electrode to a certain extent. In this paper, Fe/Zn bimetallic MOF rod-like superstructure was prepared based on Ostwald theory. Accompanied by sulfuration, the MOF was effectively combined with MoS2 and GO, and the objective materials Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO composites were successfully prepared. The MOF material provides a good frame and an efficient electron transport path, while the robust rGO wall effectively inhibits the pulverization of materials during the lithium/sodium intercalation/escalation courses. This particular material exhibited excellent cycling and rate capability performance when used in Li/Na-ion batteries. When used in Li-batteries, the electrode material delivered a specific capacity of 1598.3 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and remained at 1196.7 mA h g-1 even after about 100 cycles and further exhibited a specific capacity of 368.68 mA h g-1 at the current rate of 5 A g-1 even after 1000 cycles, respectively. As for sodium batteries, these electrode materials exhibited an initial reversible capacity of 1053.6 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and the reversible capacity was still as high as 592.2 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles. It is perhaps that this composite material with its particular architecture and composition is greatly beneficial for electron transfer and Li/Na ion diffusion. In the repeated physicochemical/nutrifying process, the appropriate distance between adjacent MOFs is of great help in preventing volume changes and thus improving the electrochemical performance.",

        "abstract": "Tin (Sn) is considered to be an ideal candidate for the anode of sodium ion batteries. However, the design of Sn-based electrodes with maintained long-term stability still remains challenging due to their huge volume expansion (≈420%) and easy pulverization during cycling. Herein, a facile and versatile strategy for the synthesis of nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dot (GQD) edge-anchored Sn nanodots as the pillars into reduced graphene oxide blocks (NGQD/Sn-NG) for ultrafast and ultrastable sodium-ion storage is reported. Sn nanodots (2-5 nm) anchored at the edges of \"octopus-like\" GQDs via covalent SnOC/SnNC bonds function as the pillars that ensure fast Na-ion/electron transport across the graphene blocks. Moreover, the chemical and spatial (layered structure) confinements not only suppress Sn aggregation, but also function as physical barriers for buffering volume change upon sodiation/desodiation. Consequently, the NGQD/Sn-NG with high structural stability exhibits excellent rate performance (555 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and 198 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 ) and ultra-long cycling stability (184 mAh g-1 remaining even after 2000 cycles at 5 A g-1 ).

        "abstract": "Additives in the electrolyte solution of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have a large impact on the performance of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that forms on the anode and is a key to the stability and durability of LIBs. We theoretically investigated effects of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), a representative additive, that has recently attracted considerable attention for the enhancement of cycling stability of silicon electrodes and the improvement of reversibility of sodium-ion batteries. First, we intensively examined the reductive decompositions by ring-opening, hydrogen fluoride (HF) elimination to form a vinylene carbonate (VC) additive and intermolecular chemical reactions of FEC in the ethylene carbonate (EC) electrolyte, by using density functional theory (DFT) based molecular dynamics and the blue-moon ensemble technique for the free energy profile. The results show that the most plausible product of the FEC reductive decomposition is lithium fluoride (LiF), and that the reactivity of FEC to anion radicals is found to be inert compared to the VC additive. We also investigated the effects of the generated LiF on the SEI by using two model systems; (1) LiF molecules distributed in a model aggregate of organic SEI film components (SFCs) and (2) a LiF aggregate interfaced with the SFC aggregate. DFT calculations of the former system show that F atoms form strong bindings with the Li atoms of multiple organic SFC molecules and play as a joint connecting them. In the latter interface system, the LiF aggregate adsorbs the organic SFCs through the F-Li bindings. These results suggest that LiF moieties play the role of glue in the organic SFC within the SEI film. We also examined the interface structure between a LiF aggregate and a lithiated silicon anode, and found that they are strongly bound. This strong binding is likely to be related to the effectiveness of the FEC additive in the electrolyte for the silicon anode.",

        "abstract": "Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an emerging material family having several potential applications. Their porous framework and redox-active centers enable gas/ion adsorption, allowing them to function as safe, cheap, and tunable electrode materials in next-generation batteries, as well as CO2 adsorption materials for carbon-capture applications. Herein, we develop four polyimide COFs by combining aromatic triamines with aromatic dianhydrides and provide detailed structural and electrochemical characterization. Through density functional theory (DFT) calculations and powder X-ray diffraction, we achieve a detailed structural characterization, where DFT calculations reveal that the imide bonds prefer to form at an angle with one another, breaking the 2D symmetry, which shrinks the pore width and elongates the pore walls. The eclipsed perpendicular stacking is preferable, while sliding of the COF sheets is energetically accessible in a relatively flat energy landscape with a few metastable regions. We investigate the potential use of these COFs in CO2 adsorption and electrochemical applications. The adsorption and electrochemical properties are related to the structural and chemical characteristics of each COF, giving new insights for advanced material designs. For CO2 adsorption specifically, the two best performing COFs originated from the same triamine building block, which—in combination with force-field calculations—revealed unexpected structure–property relationships. Specific geometries provide a useful framework for Na-ion intercalation with retainable capacities and stable cycle life at a relatively high working potential (>1.5 V vs Na/Na+). Although this capacity is low compared to conventional inorganic Li-ion materials, we show as a proof of principle that these COFs are especially promising for sustainable, safe, and stable Na-aqueous batteries due to the combination of their working potentials and their insoluble nature in water.",

        "abstract": "The sub‐10 nm metal‐based nanomaterials (SMNs) show great potential for the electrochemical energy storage field. However, their ion storage capacity and stability suffer from severe agglomeration and interface problems. Herein, a universal strategy is reported to synthesize a wide range of SMNs (e.g., metal, nitride, oxide, and sulfides) embedded in free‐standing carbon foam (SMN/FC‐F) composite electrodes by crossing the interfacial confinement of NaCl self‐assembly with the thermal‐mechanical coupling of powder metallurgy. The pressure‐enhanced NaCl self‐assembly interfacial confinement is greatly beneficial to preventing SMN agglomeration and promoting SMNs embedded in FC‐F which originate from the welding of carbon nanosheets. They are confirmed via a series of advanced characterizations including X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and spherical aberration‐corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, with theoretical computations. Benefiting from the unique structure, SMNs/FC‐F delivers ultrafast and stable ion‐storage kinetics. As a proof‐of‐concept demonstration, the MoS2/FC‐F shows excellent ion storage kinetics and superior long‐term cycling performance for ion storage (e.g., Na3V2(PO4)2O2F/C//MoS2/FC‐F sodium‐ion batteries exhibit a high reversible capacity of 185 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with a decay rate of 0.05% per cycle.).

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) displays great potential for high-performance sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its cost-effective, simple fabrication and most likely to be commercialized. However, the complicated microstructures of HC lead to difficulties in deeply understanding the structure-performance correlation. Particularly, evaluation of influence of pore structure on Na storage performances is still causing disputes and rational strategies of designing pore architecture of HC are still necessary. In this work, the skillful and controllable phase-inversion method is applied to construct porous HC with abundantly interconnected and permeable tunnel-like pores, which can promote ionic diffusion and improve electrode-electrolyte interfacial affinity. Structure-performance investigation reveals that porous HC with cross-coupled macropore architecture can boost Na storage performances comprehensively. Compared to pristine HC with negligible pores, well-regulated porous HC anodes show an obvious enhancement on initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 68.3% (only 51.5% for pristine HC), reversible capacity of 332.7 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1, rate performance with 67.4% capacity retention at 2 A g-1 (46.5% for pristine HC), and cycling stability with 95% capacity maintained for 90 cycles (86.4% for pristine HC). Additionally, the ICE can be optimized up to 76% by using sodium carboxymethyl cellulose as a binder.

        "abstract": "The increasing demand for graphite and the higher lithium content than environment abundance make the recycling of anode in spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) also become an inevitable trend. This work proposes a simple pathway to convert the retired graphite to high-performance expanded graphite (EG) under mild conditions. After the oxidation and intercalation by FeCl3 for the retired graphite, H2 O2 molecules are more likely to penetrate into the extended layers. And the gas phase diffusion caused by the produced O2 from the redox reaction between FeCl3 and H2 O2 further promotes lattice expansion of interlayers (0.535 nm), which is beneficial to the stripping of graphene oxide (GO) with fewer layers. The EG exhibits excellent electrochemical performances in both LIBs and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). It delivers 331.5 mAh g-1 at 3C (1C = 372 mA g-1 ) in LIBs, while it achieves 176.8 mAh g-1 at 3C (1C = 120 mA g-1 ) in SIBs. Then the capacity retains 753.6 (LIBs) and 201.6 (SIBs) mAh g-1 after a long-term cycling of 500 times at 1C, respectively. The full cells with the EG electrodes after prelithium/presodiation also show excellent cycle stability. Thus, this work offers another referable strategy for the recycling of waste graphite in spent LIBs.",

        "abstract": "To prepare highly N-doped carbon materials (HNCs) as well as to determine the influence of N dopants on Na-ion storage performance, hexamine-based metal-organic frameworks are employed as new and efficient precursors in the preparation of HNCs. The HNCs possess reversible capacities as high as 160 and 142 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1 (≈8 C) and 5 A g-1 (≈20 C), respectively, and maintain values of 145 and 123 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles, thus exhibiting excellent rate and long-term cyclic performance. Based on systematic analysis, a new insight into the roles of the different N configurations in Na-ion storage is proposed. The adsorption of Na ions on pyridinic-N (N-6) and pyrrolic-N (N-5) is fully irreversible, whereas the adsorption on graphitic-N (N-Q) is partially reversible and the adsorption on N-oxide (N-O) is fully reversible. More importantly, the N-6/N-Q ratio is an intrinsic parameter that reflects the relationship between the N configurations and carbon textures for N-doped carbons prepared from in situ pyrolysis of organic precursors. The cyclic stability and rate-performance improve with decreasing N-6/N-Q ratio. Therefore, this work is of great significance for the design of N-doped carbon electrodes with high performance for sodium ion batteries.",

The carbon layers and 3D GA together build a 3D conductive matrix, which not only tolerates the volume expansion as well as prevents the aggregation and pulverization of Ni2 P nanoparticles during Na+ insertion/extraction processes, but also provides a 3D conductive highway for rapid charge transfer processes.

        "abstract": "SnS2/reduced graphite oxide (rGO) composite materials show great potential as high-performance anode candidates in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high specific capacities and power densities. However, the repeated formation/decomposition of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer around composite anodes usually consumes additional sodium cations, resulting in poor Coulombic efficiency and decreasing specific capacity upon cycling. Therefore, in order to compensate for the large irreversible sodium loss of the SnS2/rGO anode, this study has proposed a facile strategy by implementing organic solutions of sodium-biphenyl/tetrahydrofuran (Na-Bp/THF) and sodium-naphthylamine/dimethoxyethane (Na-Naph/DME) as chemical presodiation reagents. Particularly, the storage stability of Na-Bp/THF and Na-Naph/DME in ambient air accompanied by their presodiation behavior on the SnS2/rGO anode has been investigated, and both reagents exhibited desirable ambient air-tolerant storage stability with favorable sodium supplement effects even after 20 days of storage. More importantly, the initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of SnS2/rGO electrodes could be controllably increased by immersing in a presodiation reagent for different durations. Consequently, with a facile chemical presodiation strategy of immersion in Na-Bp/THF solution for only 3 min in ambient air, the presodiated SnS2/rGO anode has exhibited an outstanding electrochemical performance with a high ICE of 95.6% as well as an ultrahigh specific capacity of 879.2 mAh g-1 after 300 cycles (83.5% of its initial capacity), highly superior to the pristine SnS2/rGO anode. This efficient and scalable presodiation strategy provides a new avenue for the prevailing application of other anode candidates in high-energy SIBs.",

        "abstract": "For most alloying- and conversion-type anode materials, a huge volume expansion and structure degradation of the electrodes always hinder their applications. In this work, a novel core-shell-shell Sb2S3/Sb@TiO2@C nanorod composite has been designed layer by layer, which includes an inner Sb2S3/Sb heterostructure core protected by an oxygen-deficient TiO2 shell and a conductive carbon shell. It is interesting to observe that, during the carbothermic reduction process, the previous Sb2S3 nanorod cores are partially reduced into a metallic Sb phase and the reduced TiO2 also creates many oxygen vacancies, which can greatly enhance the conductivity of the semiconductor Sb2S3. Thanks to the double effects of the TiO2 middle shell and carbon outer shell, the unique double-shelled structure design creates an enhanced dual protection, which can better accommodate the volume-expansive deformation and preserve the structural integrity of the active Sb2S3/Sb core. Especially, the TiO2 middle layer is self-assembled by numerous nanoparticles acting as a nanopillar backbone, which supports between the nanorod core and outer carbon shell to better buffer the volume changes. As a result, the core-shell-shell Sb2S3/Sb@TiO2@C anode shows lithium and sodium storage performances superior to those of the pristine Sb2S3 and core-shell Sb2S3@TiO2 electrodes. For lithium-ion batteries, the Sb2S3/Sb@TiO2@C nanorod composite achieves an initial discharge/recharge capacity of 1244.9/1005.1 mAh g-1 with an initial Coulombic efficiency of about 80.7%, an enhanced rate capability with a capacity of 593.2 mA h g-1 at 5.0 A g-1, and prolonged cycling life for 500 cycles with a reversible capacity of 495.8 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1. For sodium-ion batteries, the nanorodalso exhibits an improved performance with an initial discharge/recharge capacity of 781.4/574.0 mAh g-1 (initial Coulombic efficiency of about 73.46%) and cycling for 400 cycles with a reversible capacity of 422.6 mAh g-1 at 0.8 A g-1.

        "abstract": "Sodium Super Ionic Conductor (NASICON) structured phosphate framework compounds represent a very attractive class of materials for their use as Na-ion battery electrodes. A series of NASICON-structured NaxTi2(PO4)3 compounds corresponding to varying degrees of sodiation (x = 1-4) have been investigated using high-level hybrid density functional theory calculations using the Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals and Gaussian-type basis set formalism together with hybrid B1WC and HSE06 exchange-correlation functionals. Using primitive cells of NaxTi2(PO4)3 compounds with different stoichiometry, sodium sublattice structure and titanium oxidation states are constructed and analyzed using group theoretical symmetry considerations. The existence of mixed titanium oxidation states for x = 4 (Ti2+/Ti3+) and x = 2 (Ti3+/Ti4+) and a single oxidation state for x = 1 (Ti4+) and x = 3 (Ti3+) has been demonstrated. The results show a necessary set of symmetry reductions taking place due to the highest possible sodium/vacancy and titanium charge ordering with changing x. For each composition, an electroneutrality condition for the oxidation states of all atoms was applied which led to the discovery of several energy minima corresponding to different electronic configurations as identified by different Ti magnetic moments. An interesting relation between the bulk electronic properties of NaxTi2(PO4)3 compounds and the variation of sodium content was also found. In addition to sodium and titanium oxidation state charge ordering, the existence of large differences between the origin and the size of the band gap is shown. The band gap changes from the 4.05 eV 2p-3d gap in Na1Ti2(PO4)3 to the 0.59 eV 3d-3d gap in Na4Ti(PO4)3 with extra states due to mixed titanium valence. These results serve as an important electronic structure benchmark for further studies of such polyanion materials and help to explain some important properties of these systems relevant to battery applications.",

        "abstract": "Developing high‐performance carbonaceous anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) is still a grand quest for a more sustainable future of energy storage. Introducing sulfur within a carbon framework is one of the most promising attempts toward the development of highly efficient anode materials. Herein, a microporous sulfur‐rich carbon anode obtained from a liquid sulfur‐containing oligomer is introduced. The sodium storage mechanism shifts from surface‐controlled to diffusion‐controlled at higher synthesis temperatures. The different storage mechanisms and electrode performances are found to be independent of the bare electrode material's interplanar spacing. Therefore, these differences are attributed to an increased microporosity and a thiophene‐rich chemical environment. The combination of these properties enables extending the plateau region to higher potential and achieving reversible overpotential sodium storage. Moreover, in‐operando small‐angle X‐ray scattering (SAXS) reveals reversible electron density variations within the pore structure, in good agreement with the pore‐filling sodium storage mechanism occurring in hard carbons (HCs). Eventually, the depicted framework will enable the design of high‐performance anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries with competitive energy density.",

        "abstract": "The modulation of heterointerfaces in 2D materials is critically important for improving the electrochemical performance of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). In this context, the MoS2/Ti3C2Tx MXene heterostructure is taken as a typical example to reveal the fundamental principle of high sodium storage performance by regulating the terminal groups of Ti3C2Tx. It is demonstrated that MoS2/Ti3C2(OH)x (M/‐(OH)x) heterostructure with a high work function difference generates an enhanced built‐in electric field, which facilitates charge transfer. Moreover, ether‐based electrolytes, when compared to ester‐based electrolytes, provide lower solvation‐free energies and exhibit high compatibility with M/‐(OH)x, resulting in superior rate capability. Notably, COMSOL simulations of sodium ion (Na+) concentration and Na+ flux distributions reveal that the M/‐(OH)x electrode has low concentration polarization and rapid diffusion kinetics in ether‐based electrolytes. Consequently, the combination of M/‐(OH)x heterostructure with the ether‐based electrolyte provides 224.06 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 5.0 A g−1. Furthermore, the Na3V2(PO4)3/C//M/‐(OH)x full cell demonstrates robust electrochemical performance, delivering 116.49 mAh g−1 after 140 cycles at 1.0 A g−1. These findings emphasize the impact of modulating terminal functional groups to optimize the electrochemical functionality of heterostructures and highlight the crucial role of electrode/electrolyte synergistic coupling in advancing the practical applications of SIBs.",

When used as an anode material for LIBs, PPTS delivers a high reversible specific capacity of 697.1 mAh g -1 at 0.1 A g -1 and good rate performance (335.4 mAh g -1 at 1 A g -1 ).

        "abstract": "Knowledge about capacity losses related to the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) is still limited. One major challenge in SIBs is that the solubility of SEI species in liquid electrolytes is comparatively higher than the corresponding species formed in Li‐ion batteries. This study sheds new light on the associated capacity losses due to initial SEI formation, SEI dissolution and subsequent SEI reformation, charge leakage via SEI and subsequent SEI growth, and diffusion‐controlled sodium trapping in electrode particles. By using a variety of electrochemical cycling protocols, synchrotron‐based X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC‐MS), and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H‐NMR) spectroscopy, capacity losses due to changes in the SEI layer during different open circuit pause times are investigated in nine different electrolyte solutions. It is shown that the amount of capacity lost depends on the interplay between the electrolyte chemistry and the thickness and stability of the SEI layer. The highest capacity loss is measured in NaPF6 in ethylene carboante mixed with diethylene carbonate electrolyte (i.e., 5 µAh h−1/2pause or 2.78 mAh g·h−1/2pause) while the lowest value is found in NaTFSI in ethylene carbonate mixed with dimethoxyethance electrolyte (i.e., 1.3 µAh h−1/2pause or 0.72 mAh g·h−1/2pause).",

However, uneven metal deposition and notorious dendrite proliferation synchronously hamper its broad application prospects. Here, a three-dimensional (3D) porous hierarchical silver/reduced graphene oxide (Ag/rGO) microlattice aerogel is devised as a sodiophilic monolith, which is realized by a direct ink writing 3D printing technology. The thus-printed Na@Ag/rGO electrode retains a durable cycling lifespan over 3100 h at 3.0 mA cm-2/1.0 mAh cm-2, concurrently harvesting a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.80%. Impressively, it can be cycled for 340 h at a stringent condition of 6.0 mA cm-2 with a large areal capacity of 60.0 mAh cm-2 (∼1036.31 mAh g-1). Meanwhile, the well-regulated Na ion flux and uniform deposition kinetics are systematically probed by comprehensive electroanalytical analysis and theoretical simulations. As a result, assembled Na metal full battery delivers a long cycling sustainability over 500 cycles at 100 mA g-1 with a low per-cycle decay of 0.85%.

        "abstract": "To render the sodium ion battery (SIB) competitive among other technologies, the processes behind sodium storage in hard carbon anodes must be understood. For this purpose, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is usually undervalued, since fitting the spectra with equivalent circuit models requires an a priori knowledge about the system at hand. The analysis of the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) is an alternative, which refrains from fitting arbitrarily nested equivalent circuits. In this paper, the sodiation and desodiation of a hard carbon anode is studied by EIS at different states of charge (SOC). By reconstructing the DRT function, highly resolved information on the number and relative contribution of individual electrochemical processes is derived. During the sloping part of the sodiation curve, mass transport is found to be the most dominant source of resistance but rapidly diminishes when the plateau phase is reached. An equivalent circuit model qualitatively reproducing the experimental data of the sloping region was built upon the DRT results, which is particularly useful for future EIS studies on hard carbon SIB anodes. More importantly, this work contributes to establish EIS as a practical tool to directly study electrode processes without the bias of a previously assumed model.",

However, poor cyclability and rate performance of Sb2O3 derived from a large volume change during insertion/desertion reactions as well as a sluggish kinetic process restrict its practical application. Herein, we report a facile amorphous-to-crystalline strategy to synthesize a densely packed Sb2O3 nanosheet-graphene aerogel as a novel anode for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). This Sb2O3/graphene composite displays a reversible capacity as high as 657.9 mA h g-1 even after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1, along with an excellent rate capacity of 356.8 mA h g-1 at 5.0 A g-1. The superior electrochemical performance is attributed to the synergistic effects of densely packed Sb2O3 nanosheets and graphene aerogel, which serves as both a robust support and stable buffer layer to maintain the structural stability of the nanocomposite, and enhances the electrode kinetics of electrolyte diffusion and electron transfer simultaneously. Hence, this densely-packed two-dimensional Sb2O3 nanosheet-graphene aerogel can be a promising anode material for rechargeable SIBs due to its facile synthesis process and outstanding electrochemical performance.",

An astonishing capacity of 1377 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and a degree of recovery of 100% were observed for the film in which the interactions among the components were optimized.

Aiming at finding a new SIB anode material, we investigate the electrochemical properties of NaxTiO2 compounds with unprecedented penta-oxygen-coordinated trigonal bipyramid (TB) structures by using first-principles calculations. Identifying the four different TB phases, we perform the optimization of their crystal structures and calculate their energetics such as sodium binding energy, formation energy, electrode potential and activation energy for Na ion migration. The computations reveal that the TB-I phase is the best choice among the four TB phases for a SIB anode material due to a relatively low volume change of under 4% upon Na insertion, low electrode voltage under 1.0 V with a possibility of realizing the highest specific capacity of ∼335 mA h g-1 from full sodiation at x = 1, and reasonably low activation barriers under 0.35 eV at the Na content from x = 0.125 to x = 0.5. Through the analysis of electronic density of states and charge density difference upon sodiation, we find that the NaxTiO2 compounds in TB phases change from electron insulating to electron conducting materials due to the electron transfer from Na atoms to Ti ions, offering the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couple for SIB operation.",

The WSx (2 ≤ x ≤ 3, amorphous WS3 and crystalline WS2) nanofiber is successfully prepared by electrospinning and subsequent calcination in a reducing atmosphere. To prevent capacity degradation of the WSx anodes originating from sulfur dissolution, a facile post-thermal treatment in air is applied to form an oxide passivation surface. Interestingly, WO3 thorn bundles are randomly grown on the nanofiber stem, resulting from the surface conversion. We elucidate the evolving morphological and structural features of the nanofibers during post-thermal treatment. The heterogeneous thorn-bush nanofiber electrodes deliver a high second discharge capacity of 791 mAh g(-1) and improved cycle performance for 100 cycles compared to the pristine WSx nanofiber. We show that this hierarchical design is effective in reducing sulfur dissolution, as shown by cycling analysis with counter Na electrodes.",

        "abstract": "Because of the abundance and cost effectiveness of sodium, rechargeable sodium metal batteries have been widely studied to replace current lithium-ion batteries. However, there are some critical unresolved issues including the high reactivity of sodium, an unstable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), and sodium dendrite formation. While several studies have been conducted to understand sodium plating/stripping processes, only a very limited number of studies have been carried out under operando conditions. We have employed operando X-ray and optical imaging techniques to understand the mechanistic behavior of Na metal plating. The morphology of sodium metal plated on a copper electrode depends strongly on the salts and solvents used in the electrolyte. The addition of a fluorine-containing additive to a carbonate-based electrolyte, NaClO4 in propylene carbonate (PC):fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), results in uniform sodium plating processes and much more stable cycling performance, compared to NaClO4 in PC, because of the formation of a stable SEI containing NaF. A NaF layer, on top of the sodium metal, leads to a much more uniform deposition of sodium and greatly enhanced cyclability.",

        "abstract": "Na-ion batteries are attractive as an alternative to Li-ion batteries because of their lower cost. Organic compounds have been considered as promising electrode materials due to their environmental friendliness and molecular diversity. Herein, aluminum-coordinated poly(tetrahydroxybenzoquinone) (P(THBQ-Al)), one of the coordination polymers, is introduced for the first time as a promising cathode for Na-ion batteries. P(THBQ-Al) is synthesized through a facile coordination reaction between benzoquinonedihydroxydiolate (C6O6H22-) and Al3+ as ligands and complex metal ions, respectively. Tetrahydroxybenzoquinone is environmentally sustainable, because it can be obtained from natural resources such as orange peels. Benzoquinonedihydroxydiolate also contributes to delivering high reversible capacity, because each benzoquinonedihydroxydiolate unit is capable of two electron reactions through the sodiation of its conjugated carbonyl groups. Electrochemically inactive Al3+ improves the structural stability of P(THBQ-Al) during cycling because of a lack of a change in its oxidation state. Moreover, P(THBQ-Al) is thermally stable and insoluble in nonaqueous electrolytes. These result in excellent electrochemical performance including a high reversible capacity of 113 mA h g-1 and stable cycle performance with negligible capacity fading over 100 cycles. Moreover, the reaction mechanism of P(THBQ-Al) is clarified through ex situ XPS and IR analyses, in which the reversible sodiation of C═O into C-O-Na is observed.",

        "title": "Fast-Charging Capability of Thin-Film Prussian Blue Analogue Electrodes for Aqueous Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Prussian blue analogues are considered as promising candidates for aqueous sodium-ion batteries providing a decently high energy density for stationary energy storage. However, suppose the operation of such materials under high-power conditions could be facilitated. In that case, their application might involve fast-response power grid stabilization and enable short-distance urban mobility due to fast re-charging. In this work, sodium nickel hexacyanoferrate thin-film electrodes are synthesized via a facile electrochemical deposition approach to form a model system for a robust investigation. Their fast-charging capability is systematically elaborated with regard to the electroactive material thickness in comparison to a ″traditional″ composite-type electrode. It is found that quasi-equilibrium kinetics allow extremely fast (dis)charging within a few seconds for sub-micron film thicknesses. Specifically, for a thickness below ≈ 500 nm, 90% of the capacity can be retained at a rate of 60C (1 min for full (dis)charge). A transition toward mass transport control is observed when further increasing the rate, with thicker films being dominated by this mode earlier than thinner films. This can be entirely attributed to the limiting effects of solid-state diffusion of Na+ within the electrode material. By presenting a PBA model cell yielding 25 Wh kg-1 at up to 10 kW kg-1, this work highlights a possible pathway toward the guided design of hybrid battery-supercapacitor systems. Furthermore, open challenges associated with thin-film electrodes are discussed, such as the role of parasitic side reactions, as well as increasing the mass loading.",

Here, NaAlH4 nanoconfined in carbon scaffolds as an anode material for Li-ion batteries is reported for the first time. Nanoconfined NaAlH4 was prepared by melt infiltration into mesoporous carbon scaffolds. In the first cycle, the electrochemical reversibility of nanoconfined NaAlH4 was improved from around 30 to 70% compared to that of nonconfined NaAlH4. Cyclic voltammetry revealed that nanoconfinement alters the conversion pathway, and operando powder X-ray diffraction showed that the conversion from NaAlH4 into Na3AlH6 is favored over the formation of LiNa2AlH6. The electrochemical reactivity of the carbon scaffolds has also been investigated to study their contribution to the overall capacity of the electrodes.",

        "abstract": "Increasing environmental problems and energy challenges have so far attracted urgent demand for developing green and efficient energy‐storage systems. Among various energy‐storage technologies, sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), electrochemical capacitors (ECs) and especially the already commercialized lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) are playing very important roles in the portable electronic devices or the next‐generation electric vehicles. Therefore, the research for finding new electrode materials with reduced cost, improved safety, and high‐energy density in these energy storage systems has been an important way to satisfy the ever‐growing demands. Symmetric electrodes have recently become a research focus because they employ the same active materials as both the cathode and anode in the same energy‐storage system, leading to the reduced manufacturing cost and simplified fabrication process. Most importantly, this feature also endows the symmetric energy‐storage system with improved safety, longer lifetime, and ability of charging in both directions. In this Progress Report, we provide the comprehensive summary and comment on different symmetric electrodes and focus on the research about the applications of symmetric electrodes in different energy‐storage systems, such as the above mentioned SIBs, ECs and LIBs. Further considerations on the possibility of mass production have also been presented.",

        "abstract": "Alloying-type anodes show capacity and density advantages for sodium/potassium-ion batteries (SIBs/PIBs), but they encounter serious structural degradation upon cycling, which cannot be resolved through conventional nanostructuring techniques. Herein, we present an in-depth study to reveal the intrinsic reason for the pulverization of bismuth (Bi) materials upon (de)alloying and report a novel particle-in-bulk architecture with Bi nanospheres inlaid in the bulk carbon (BiNC) to achieve durable Na/K storage. We simulate the volume-expansion-resistant mechanism of Bi during the (de)alloying reaction and unveil that the irreversible phase transition upon (de)alloying underlies the fundamental origin for the structural degradation of Bi anode, while a proper compressive stress (~10%) raised by the bulk carbon can trigger a \"domino-like\" Bi crystal recovering. Consequently, the as obtained BiNC exhibits a record high volumetric capacity (823.1 mAh cm-3 for SIBs, 848.1 mAh cm-3 for PIBs) and initial coulombic efficiency (95.3% for SIBs, 96.4% for PIBs), and unprecedented cycling stability (15000 cycles for SIBs with only 0.0015% degradation per cycle), outperforming the state-of-the-art literature.

        "abstract": "Glyme-based electrolytes are one of the promising candidates in the development of sodium ion batteries due to their compatibility with conventional graphite electrodes. Recent studies have shown that the chelation effect significantly affects the ion pair formation in these sodium-glyme based electrolytes. However, the solvation structure and dynamics of the sodium-glyme complex have yet to be fully characterized. In this paper, the structure and the motions of the sodium-glyme complex are investigated by using the thiocyanate ion as a reporter of the structure. To this end, steady state and time resolved infrared spectroscopy in conjunction with computational simulations and numerical modeling are used. Overall, the experiments show that the anion is mostly associated with the cation forming contact ion-pairs in all solutions. Time resolved vibrational anisotropy shows a bi-exponential dynamics which is in agreement with the reorientational dynamics of the thiocyanate ion describing its restricted and the overall rotations in the ion-pair-glyme complex. In addition, two dimensional infrared spectroscopy with parallel polarization reveals two dynamical processes for the anion with time scales that increase as a function of glyme length. The molecular motions giving rise to the observed vibrational dynamics are derived by comparing the results with a model describing the restricted rotational diffusion of an axially symmetric particle. The simulated anisotropy shows a good agreement with the experimental measurement. However, to obtain a good agreement of the simulated decorrelation time of the frequency-frequency correlation function (FFCF) with the experiment, a loose tethered oscillator with large stochastic fluctuations is needed. The large stochastic motions are described in terms of the dynamics of the glyme end chains given the observed correlation between the dynamics of the FFCF and the glyme length.",

However, the inferior electrical conductivity and devastating volume change and interface instability have largely hindered their practical electrochemical properties. Here, ultrathin amorphous TiO2 layer is constructed on the surface of a metal-organic framework derived porous Fe7 S8 /C electrode via a facile atomic layer deposition strategy. By virtue of the porous structure and enhanced conductivity of the Fe7 S8 /C, the electroactive TiO2 layer is expected to effectively improve the electrode interface stability and structure integrity of the electrode. As a result, the TiO2 -modified Fe7 S8 /C anode exhibits significant performance improvement for sodium-ion batteries. The optimal TiO2 -modified Fe7 S8 /C electrode delivers reversible capacity of 423.3 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles with high capacity retention of 75.3% at 0.2 C. Meanwhile, the TiO2 coating is conducive to construct favorable solid electrolyte interphase, leading to much enhanced initial Coulombic efficiency from 66.9% to 72.3%. The remarkable improvement suggests that the interphase modification holds great promise for high-performance metal sulfide-based anode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Because of its natural abundance and high theoretical specific capacity (3579 mAh g-1, based on Li15Si4), silicon and its composites have been extensively studied as the negative electrode for future high energy density lithium-ion batteries. While rapid failure due to the significant volumetric strain of lithium-silicon reactions makes bulk silicon unsuitable for practical applications, silicon nanoparticles can sustain the large volume changes without fracturing. However, polymeric binders are usually required to maintain the structural integrity of electrodes made of particles. Recent lithium-ion half-cell tests have shown that lithium ion-exchanged Nafion (designated as Li-Nafion) and sodium alginate are highly promising binders for nanoparticle silicon electrodes. Nevertheless, there is scant information on the performance and durability of these electrodes in full cell tests which are likely to reveal the role of binders under more realistic conditions. This work focuses on understanding the role of various binders in lithium-ion full cells consisting of Si negative electrode and LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 positive electrode. This study demonstrates, possibly for the first time, that silicon nanoparticles with either Li-Nafion or sodium alginate as binder can maintain a constant capacity of 1200 mAh g-1 for more than 100 cycles. In addition, during deep charge/discharge cycling, silicon electrodes containing Li-Nafion, Nafion, and sodium alginate can exhibit better capacity retention and higher specific capacity than that of silicon electrodes using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as a binder.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have aroused intense research and academic interest due to the natural abundance and cost-effectiveness of sodium resources. Presently, cathode materials based on the Na3(VO1-xPO4)2F1+2x (0 ≤ x ≤ 1, NVPF1+2x) polyanionic framework show intriguing electrochemical performances toward practical and advanced SIBs due to its high operating voltage (>3.9 V) and high energy density (>500 Wh kg-1). Different from conventional approaches focusing on delicate morphology design, metal ion substitution, and the conductive matrix's incorporation to overcome the low intrinsic electrical conductivity, here we adopt a one-step microwave-assisted hydrothermal approach to optimize the electrochemical performances of NVPF1+2x via manipulating its phase compositions with different vanadium sources and distinguishing the tetragonal (I4/mmm) symmetry of the Na3(VOPO4)2F phase from the orthorhombic symmetry (Amam) of the Na3V2(PO4)2F3 phase. The introduction of the conductive reduced graphene oxide (rGO) framework and its impacts on the phase compositions were systematically investigated. The rGO framework with different calcination temperature can alter the phase composition and the electrical conductivity of NVPF1+2x cathodes significantly, thus having a great impact on their electrochemical performances. Galvanostatic charge/discharge, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique are adopted to compare their electrode polarization and kinetics difference and show that NVPF@rGO-600 °C possesses a high rate, small polarization, and fast kinetics electrochemical properties. This work provides new insights into manipulating phase compositions of the NVPF1+2x cathode by modulating the synthesis conditions and revealing their synergistic effect with a rGO conductive framework toward a superior rate capability and more realistic practical applications for SIBs.",

        "title": "Covalent Pinning of Highly Dispersed Ultrathin Metallic-Phase Molybdenum Disulfide Nanosheets on the Inner Surface of Mesoporous Carbon Spheres for Durable and Rapid Sodium Storage.",
        "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenide materials show potential for use in alkali metal ion batteries owing to their remarkable physical and chemical properties. Nevertheless, the electrochemical energy storage performance is still impaired by the tendency of aggregation, volume, and morphological change during the conversion reaction and poor intrinsic conductivity. Until now, ultrathin molybdenum disulfide nanosheets with a metallic-phase structure on the inner surface of mesoporous hollow carbon spheres (M-MoS2@HCS) have rarely been investigated as an anode for sodium-ion batteries. In this work, a novel M-MoS2@HCS anode was designed and synthesized by employing a template-assisted solvothermal reaction. Structural and chemical analyses indicate that the M-MoS2 nanosheets with a larger interlayer spacing compared to their semiconductor counterpart grow on the inner surface of HCS via covalent interactions. When used as the anode materials for Na+ storage, the M-MoS2@HCS anode presents durable and rapid sodium storage properties. The developed electrode shows a reversible capacity of 291.2 mAh g-1 at a high current density of 5 A g-1. After 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1, the reversible capacity is 401.3 mAh g-1 with a capacity retention rate of 79%. After 2500 cycles at 1.0 A g-1, the electrode still delivers a reversible capacity of 320.1 mAh g-1 with a capacity retention rate of 75%. The excellent sodium storage capability of the MoS2@HCS electrode is explained by the special structural design, which reveals great potential to accelerate the practical applications of transition-metal dichalcogenide electrodes for sodium storage.",

Nb2O5 NCs/rGO was synthesized by controllable hydrolysis of niobium ethoxide and followed by heat treatment at 450 °C in flowing forming gas. Transmission electron microscopy images showed that Nb2O5 NCs with average particle size of 3 nm were uniformly deposited on rGO sheets and voids among Nb2O5 NCs existed. The architecture of ultrafine Nb2O5 NCs anchored on a highly conductive rGO network can not only enhance charge transfer and buffer the volume change during sodiation/desodiation process but also provide more active surface area for sodium ion storage, resulting in superior rate and cycle performance. Ex situ XPS analysis revealed that the sodium ion storage mechanism in Nb2O5 could be accompanied by Nb(5+)/Nb(4+) redox reaction and the ultrafine Nb2O5 NCs provide more surface area to accomplish the redox reaction.",

        "abstract": "The sluggish sodium-ion diffusion kinetics and low electronic conductivity have severely restricted the development of the TiO2 anode for sodium-ion batteries. Defect engineering, such as single-heteroatom doping and oxygen vacancies, has proven to be effective methods to improve the conductivity of TiO2, but a comprehensive understanding of the synergistic effect of dual-heteroatom doping and oxygen vacancies on the sodium storage performance of TiO2 is still lacking. Herein, we design a synergistic strategy of dual doping via the in situ doping and hydrogenation treatment to improve conductivity and cycling stability of TiO2. Experiments and theoretical calculations together revealed that N and C doping reduces the band gap of TiO2, while the presence of oxygen vacancies efficiently accelerates the diffusion of sodium ions. Thus N, C, and oxygen vacancies with high concentration co-doped TiO2, resulting in extraordinary high-rate performance, significant stable cycling, and long-term cyclability of up to 10,000 cycles. The synthesis strategy of dual doping proposed here emphasizes the importance of defect engineering in improving material conductivity and electrode cycling stability for possible practical applications in the near future.",

        "abstract": "Metal–organic framework‐derived metal phosphides with high capacity, facile synthesis, and morphology‐controlled are considered as potential anodes for lithium/sodium‐ion batteries. However, the severe volume expansion during cycling can cause the electrode material to collapse and reduce the cycle life. Here, novel CoP‐C@MoS2/C nanocube composites are synthesized by vapor‐phase phosphating and hydrothermal process. As the anode of LIBs, CoP‐C@MoS2/C exhibits outstanding long‐cycle performance of 369 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1 after 2000 cycles. In SIBs, the composite also displays excellent rate capability of 234 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1 and an ultra‐high the capacity retention rate of 90.16% at 1 A g−1 after 1000 cycles. Through density functional theory, it is found that the S ions and P ions at the interface formed by CoP and MoS2 can serve as Na+/Li+ diffusion channels with an action of van der Waals force, have attractive characteristics such as high ion adsorption energy, low expansion rate and fast diffusion kinetics compared with MoS2.

        "abstract": "Sodium dendrite growth is responsible for short circuiting and fire hazard of metal batteries, which limits the potential application of sodium metal anode. Sodium dendrite can be effectively suppressed by applying mechanically robust electrolyte in battery systems. Herein, a composite gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) is designed and fabricated, mainly consisting of graphene oxide (GO) and polyvinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP). With the addition of an appropriate amount of GO content, the compressive Young's modulus of 2 wt% GO+PVDF-HFP (2-GPH) composite GPE is greatly enhanced by a factor of 10, reaching 2.5 GPa, which is crucial in the suppression of sodium dendrite growth. As a result, uniform sodium deposition and ultralong reversible sodium plating/stripping (over 400 h) at high current density (5 mA cm-2 ) are achieved. Furthermore, as evidenced by molecular dynamics simulation, the GO content facilitates the sodium ion transportation, giving a high ionic conductivity of 2.3 × 10-3 S cm-1 . When coupled with Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 cathode in a full sodium metal battery, a high initial capacity of 107 mA h g-1 at 1 C (1 C = 117 mA g-1 ) is recorded, with an excellent capacity retention rate of 93.5% and high coulombic efficiency of 99.8% after 1100 cycles.",

Here, ether electrolytes with NaBF4 as the main salt or additive were applied in NFM//HC full cells and showed enhanced performance than the electrolyte with NaPF6. Then, BF4- was found to have a stronger interaction with Na+, which could reduce the solvation of Na+ with the solvent, thus inducing the formation of the cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) and solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layers rich in inorganic species. Moreover, the morphology, structure, composition, and solubility of CEI and SEI were explored, concluding that NaBF4 could induce more stable CEI and SEI layers rich in B-containing species and inorganics. This work proposes using NaBF4 as the main salt or additive to improve the performance of ether electrolytes in NFM//HC full cells, which provides a strategy to improve the compatibility of ether-based electrolytes and cathodes.",

        "title": "A Universal Strategy for Intimately Coupled Carbon Nanosheets/MoM Nanocrystals (M = P, S, C, and O) Hierarchical Hollow Nanospheres for Hydrogen Evolution Catalysis and Sodium‐Ion Storage",
        "abstract": "Intimately coupled carbon/transition‐metal‐based hierarchical nanostructures are one of most interesting electrode materials for boosting energy conversion and storage applications owing to the strong synergistic effect between the two components and appealing structural stability. Herein, a universal method is reported for making hierarchical hollow carbon nanospheres (HCSs) with intimately coupled ultrathin carbon nanosheets and Mo‐based nanocrystals. The in situ and confined reaction of the synthetic strategy can not only allow the aggregation of the nanocrystals to be impeded, but also endows extremely intimate coupled interaction between the conductive carbon nanosheets and the nanocrystals MoM (M = P, S, C and O). As a proof of concept, the as‐prepared MoP/C HCSs exhibit extraordinary hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalytic activity with small overpotential and robust durability in both acidic and alkaline solutions. In addition, the unique sheet‐on‐sheet MoS2/C HCSs as an anode demonstrate high capacity, great rate capabilities, and long‐term cycles for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). The capacity can be maintained at 410 mA h g−1 even after 1000 cycles even at a high current density of 4 A g−1, one of the best reported values for MoS2‐based electrode materials for SIBs. The present work highlights the importance of designing and fabricating functional strongly coupled hybrid materials for enhancing energy conversion and storage applications.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) is most likely to be a commercialized anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, its low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) impedes its further large-scale industrialization. Since the ICE is greatly related to the side reactions of the electrolyte on the HC surface, herein, we focus on tailoring the surface chemistry of HC via a facile low-temperature oxygen plasma (LTOP) treatment technique. The modified HC after a suitable treatment time possesses a highly ordered and low defect surface without a negligible change in layer spacing, thus facilitating Na+ deinsertion/insertion and reducing the HC/electrolyte side reactions. Moreover, LTOP treatment also brings oxygen functional groups (CO) to the HC surface to enrich Na+ storage active sites. Consequently, the modified HC reveals a higher ICE of 80.9% compared to 60.6% in the bare HC. Also, the modified HC delivers an ultrahigh specific capacity of 331.0 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and exhibits superior rate performance with a high specific capacity of 211.0 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1. This work provides a feasible strategy to tailor the surface chemistry of HC for high-efficiency Na-storage and provides a novel avenue to construct high-efficiency SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have emerged as a promising alternative to Li-ion batteries due to the abundance of sodium. However, anodes in Na-ion batteries face challenges such as dendrite formation and an unstable solid electrolyte interface layer. To address these challenges, NaK liquid metal alloy anodes have been proposed as an alternative because they do not form dendrites. In our study, we demonstrate that the NaK alloy anode interacts with the commonly used ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate electrolyte, leading to a continuously growing unstable SEI layer, evidenced by cycling failures under 100 cycles and an increasing charge transfer resistance in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies. In situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that over the course of cycling the surface of the NaK anode becomes increasingly sodium-rich. After 30 cycles, XPS analysis detects only trace amounts of potassium on the NaK anode surface. When the electrolyte is analyzed postcycling using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, there is a noticeable increase in potassium levels, suggesting that potassium metal dissolves into the electrolyte. The introduction of a 10 wt % fluoroethylene carbonate additive can mitigate this problem to some extent, enabling an enhanced cycling performance of up to 800 cycles at 1C. Nevertheless, the dissolution of K metal is still evident in the XPS results, albeit to a lesser degree. These discoveries provide valuable insights for designing a more robust SEI layer for the NaK anode.",

Moreover, the desolvation-free mechanism endows the battery with 61% of its room-temperature capacity at an ultra-low temperature of -70°C.

The optimized SnS QDs@NC electrode delivered an initial discharge capacity of 281 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 and exhibited excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 75% after 500 cycles at high current density of 1,000 mA g-1. Ex-situ XRD, XPS, FE-SEM, TEM measurements and kinetic study were performed to unveil the sodium storage mechanism of the SnS QDs@NC electrode. A sodium-ion full cell assembled with SnS QDs@NC anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode exhibited high capacity and good cycling stability. Such a superior electrochemical performance of SnS QDs@NC can be attributed to the synergistic effects of NC and SnS QDs, where NC serves as a conducting matrix to support SnS QDs and helps avoid structural degradation. This work provides a promising strategy to resolve the pulverization issue of alloying and conversion-type anode materials.",

        "abstract": "The demand for versatile and sustainable energy materials is on the rise, given the importance of developing novel clean technologies for transition to a net zero economy. Here, we present the synthesis, characterization, and application of lignin-derived ordered mesoporous carbons with various pore sizes (from 5 to approximately 50 nm) as anodes in sodium-ion batteries. We have varied the pore size using self-synthesized PEOn-b-PHAm block copolymers with different PEO and PHA chain lengths, applying the “soft templating” approach to introduce isolated spherical pores of 20 to 50 nm in diameters. The pore structure was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nitrogen physisorption, and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). We report the microstructure analysis of such mesoporous lignin-based carbons using Raman spectroscopy and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). In comparison with nontemplated carbon and carbons templated employing commercial Pluronic F-127 and PIB50-b-PEO45, which created accessible channels and spherical pores up to approximately 10 nm in diameter, the carbon microstructure analysis revealed that templating with all applied polymers significantly impedes graphitization upon thermal treatment. Furthermore, the gained knowledge of similar carbon microstructures regardless of the type of template allowed the investigation of the influence of different pore morphologies in carbon applied as an anode material in sodium-ion batteries, supporting the previous theories in the literature that closed pores are beneficial for sodium storage while providing insights into the importance of pore size.",

        "abstract": "Metal oxalate has become a most promising anode candidate material for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries. However, there exists the problem of capacity decrease due to the volume expansion of the active material during cycling. Herein, the rodlike CoC2O4·2H2O/rGO hybrid has been fabricated via a novel multi-step solvo/hydro-thermal strategy. The structure characteristic of microrod CoC2O4·2H2O wrapped using rGO sheet not only inhibits the volume variation of the hybrid electrode during the cycle, but also accelerates the transfer of electrons and ions amongst the 3D graphene network, thereby improving the electrochemical properties of CoC2O4·2H2O. The CoC2O4·2H2O/rGO electrode delivers specific capacity of 1011.5 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 200 cycles for lithium storage, and exhibits high capacity of 221.1 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 100 cycles for sodium storage. Moreover, the full cell CoC2O4·2H2O/rGO//LiCoO2 consisted of the CoC2O4·2H2O/rGO anode and LiCoO2 cathode maintains 138.1 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at 0.2 A g-1 and has superior long-cycle stability. In addition, in-situ Raman, in-situ and ex-situ X-ray diffraction techniques have provided a unique opportunity to fully understand the reaction mechanism of CoC2O4·2H2O/rGO.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are expected to be a promising commercial alternative to lithium-ion batteries for grid electricity storage due to their potential low cost in the near future. Up to the present, the anode material still remains a great challenge for the application of SIBs, especially at room temperature. Graphite has an obvious limitation to store larger radius sodium ions (Na+) in comparison with lithium ions (Li+), while the hard carbon with large interlayer distance can demonstrate a relatively high storage capability and durable cycle life. However, the disadvantages of low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) mainly caused by large surface area and high cost synthetic approach hinder its practical applications. Herein, a new coupled carbonization strategy is presented to prepare a cost-effective hard carbon material by pyrolyzing and carbonizing the mixture of abundant sucrose and phenolic resin. Benefiting from the specialized pyrolysis reaction process and optimized conditions as studied in detail, the hard carbon has an extremely low surface area of 1.54 m2 g-1 and high initial Coulombic efficiency of 87%, which have been rarely reported before and enhance the utilization efficiency of Na+ consumption within the cathode in the future. More importantly, the hard carbon, with a high interlayer distance 3.95 Å, can deliver a higher capacity of 319 mAh g-1 and maintain a finer capacity retention of 90% over 150 cycles. Besides, a full cell with the configuration of as-prepared hard carbon anode versus an air-stable O3-Na0.9[Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48]O2 cathode is further presented, and it has a high ICE of 80% and energy density of 256 Wh kganode-1 (vs hard carbon) with reliable cycle performance. The results demonstrate that our synthetic strategy is feasible and extendable, while the tunable carbon-based materials should have wider applications in addition to the attractive properties in Na-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Low utilization of active metallic sodium (Na) and uncontrollable growth of Na dendrites remain significant challenges for high-performance Na metal batteries, which are limited to inefficient Na-utilization (<1%) and shallow cycling conditions (0.25-1.0 mAh cm-2). In this work, a kind of Na metal anode with record-high utilization and long-term cycling stability is reported, using carbon substrate-supported nitrogen-anchored zinc (Zn) single atoms as current collector. Single Zn atom sites serve as a strong \"magnet\" for Na ions, which guide the metallic Na uniform nucleation and free from dendrite-induced short circuit. The nucleation overpotential of our strategy is essentially zero, where most of the reported modified substrates are greatly exceed 20 mV. Specifically, the Na anodes exhibit a high Na stripping/plating Coulombic efficiency with 99.8% over 350 cycles and a stable voltage response with small voltage hysteresis after cycling 1000 h. The full cell exhibits high Na-utilization up to 100% and superior long-term cycling stability for more than 1000 cycles with excellent capacity retention. In terms of both lifetime and Na-utilization, our strategy are significantly outperforms the reported state-of-the-art Na metal anodes. Moreover, this affords new insights into the controllable Na nucleation behavior and high Na utilization, and sheds a fresh light on atomic level design of electrode for Na metal anodes.",

The targeted pore structure and electrochemical performance are optimized by controlling the amount of methyl methacrylate monomers via free-radical polymerization, and carbonized temperature via pyrolysis treatment. The constructed carbon materials display a stable 3D fibrous network with a large specific area and abundant micro/mesopores formed during the pyrolysis of the polymer poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Taking advantage of the constructed pore structure, the optimized carbon anodes derived from BC/PMMA composites show an enhanced Na+ diffusion rate with a high capacity of 380.66 mA h g-1 at 0.03 A g-1. It is interesting that it possesses superior low-potential capacity, and retains 42% of the total capacity even at a high scan rate of 1 mV s-1.

In this work, a simple, economical, and scalable strategy is developed to inherently coat nanoporous MnS with a 3D N, S co-doped thin carbon layer by using commercially available MnCO3 as precursors. Specifically, the strategy involves a two-step annealing process, which converts the MnCO3 microparticles into nanoporous Mn2O3 and MnS step by step. The 3D N, S codoped carbon layer is in situ formed during the second annealing process by first coating the nanoporous Mn2O3 with a polyaniline layer. Due to the inherent 3D carbon protection and the strong electronic interaction between N, S dopants and MnS, the N, S codoped carbon protected MnS obtained at 900 °C (NS-C@MnS-900) anode displays a high specific capacity of 845 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, which is higher than all reported MnS-based SIB anodes. It also shows an outstanding cyclability and rate performance, maintaining a stable capacity of ≈493 mAh g-1 after 1300 cycles at 10 A g-1, which is also the best according to knowledge.

The Na storage mechanism is investigated by synchrotron‐based X‐ray scattering and absorption techniques as well as by electrochemical measurements. A very high reversible capacity in the 500th cycle of 489 mAh g−1 is observed at 2.0 A g−1 in the potential window 3.0–0.1 V. Full discharge includes irreversible generation of Ni0 and Cr0 nanoparticles embedded in nanocrystalline Na2S yielding shortened diffusion lengths and predominantly surface‐controlled charge storage. During charge, Ni0 and Cr0 are oxidized, Na2S is consumed, and amorphous Ni and Cr sulfides are formed. Limiting the potential window to 3.0–0.3 V an unusual nickel extrusion sodium insertion mechanism occurs: Ni2+ is reduced to nanosized Ni0 domains, expelled from the host lattice, and is replaced by Na+ cations to form O3‐type like NaCrS2. Surprisingly, the discharge and charge processes comprise Na+ shuttling between highly crystalline NiCr2S4 and NaCrS2 enabling a superior long‐term stability for 3000 cycles.

        "abstract": "At the research level, novel active materials for batteries are synthesised on a small scale, fabricated into electrodes and electrochemically characterised using each group’s established process due to the lack of standards. Recently, eminent researchers have criticised the implementation of e.g. low active material contents/electrode loadings, the use of research‐type battery cell constructions, or the lack of statistically relevant data, resulting in overstated data and thus giving misleading predictions of the key performance indicators of new battery technologies. Here, we report on the establishment of a reference system for the development of sodium‐ion batteries. Electrodes are fabricated under relevant conditions using 9.5 mg/cm² self‐synthesised Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode active material and 3.6 mg/cm² commercially available hard carbon anode active material. It is found that different types of battery cells are more or less suitable for half‐ and/ or full‐cell testing, resulting in ir/reproducible or underestimated active material capacities. Furthermore, the influence of electrode overhang, which is relevant for upscaling, is evaluated. The demonstrator cell (TRL 4‐5) has been further characterised providing measured data on the power/energy density and thermal behaviour during rate testing up to 15 C and projections are made for its practical limits.",

        "abstract": "Transition‐metal sulfides are promising electrochemical energy storage materials due to their abundant active sites, large interlayer space, and high theoretical capacities, especially for sodium storage. However, the low conductivity and poor cycling stability at high current densities hamper their applications. Herein, a versatile dual‐template method is reported to elaborate ordered mesoporous single‐layered MoS2/carbon composite with high specific area, uniform pore size, and large pore volume. The single‐layered MoS2 is confined in the carbon matrix. The mesopores between the composite nanorods provide fast electrolyte diffusion. The obtained nanocomposite shows a high sodium‐storage capability, excellent rate capacity, and very good cycling performance. A capacity of 310 mAh g−1 can remain at 5.0 A g−1 after 2500 cycles. Furthermore, a sodium‐ion battery (SIB) full cell composed of the MoS2/carbon composite anode and a Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode maintains a specific capacity of 330 mAh g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 during 100 cycles. The mechanism is investigated by in situ and ex situ characterizations as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations.",

Pertaining to sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), we design and fabricate Sb and Sn embedding porous carbon wires (PCWs) with SSO encapsulated (SSO@Sn/Sb‐PCWs) composite as a high capability anode in this study. Not only accelerate the Na+ ions diffusion, but also augment the stress resistance and the electrochemical reaction reversibility for the multiphase composite. Furthermore, the porous structure finely increases the ions diffusion kinetics, preventing the aggregation of Sn, Sb, and SSO particles, which achieves high reversible capacity while eliminating structure damage. As a consequence, the fabricated SSO@Sn/Sb‐PCWs electrode exhibited exceptional cycling stability, maintaining a high reversible capacity of 448 mAh g−1 after 150 charge/discharge cycles, and good rate capability with current density up to 5.0 A g−1.

X‐ray absorption spectra at the S K‐edge and Mo L3‐edge are recorded using a synchrotron source, X‐ray emission S Kα and Mo Lα spectra are obtained on a laboratory spectrometer for initial powder and electrode material at different potentials of the cell. Analysis of the spectra shows the occupation of the initially empty orbitals of MoS2 by sodium electrons as a result of the interaction of the components of the sodium‐ion half‐cell. Ex situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of a fully discharged electrode material reveal partial transformation of hexagonal MoS2 to disordered tetragonal MoS2 coated with a surface electrolyte interphase layer.

The morphological evolution of different-sized single Sn nanoparticle is visualized during the charge/discharge cycles by using a homemade planar electrode. All of the Sn nanoparticles exhibit a dramatic initial volume expansion of about 420% after sodiation to Na15Sn4. Interestingly, we find that the smaller Sn nanoparticles show a lower rate of irreversible volume change and a better shape maintenance than the larger ones after desodiation.

However, the absence of suitable anode materials is the main bottleneck for the commercial application of SIBs. Herein, the adsorption and diffusion behaviors of Na on graphether are predicted by first-principles density functional calculations. Our results show that Na atoms can be adsorbed on graphether forming a uniform and stable coverage on both sides. Even at low intercalated Na concentrations, the semiconducting graphether can be changed to a metallic state, ensuring good electrical conductivity. Due to the structural anisotropy of graphether, the Na+ ions show a remarkable one-dimensional diffusion with an ultralow energy barrier of 0.04 eV, suggesting ultrafast charge/discharge characteristics. The graphether monolayer has a high theoretical specific capacity of 670 mA h g-1, which is much higher than commercial graphite anode materials. Furthermore, the average voltage is 1.58 V, comparable with that of commercial TiO2 anode materials for LIBs (1.5 V). During the charge/discharge process, graphether could mostly preserve the structural integrity upon the adsorption of Na even at the maximum concentration, suggesting its good reversibility. All these results show that graphether is a promising anode material for high-performance SIBs.",

In this study, we put forward substituting an inert phosphate with a redox-active silicate to improve the energy density and intrinsic electroconductivity of polyanion-type phosphate materials, thus enabling an advance in sodium-ion battery cathodes. As a proof of concept, some of the phosphate of Na3V2(PO4)3 was replaced by silicate to fabricate Na3V2(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1, which exhibited a higher average discharge voltage of 3.36 V and a higher capacity of 115.8 mA h g-1 than pristine Na3V2(PO4)3 (3.31 V, 109.6 mA h g-1) at 0.5 C, therefore improving the energy density. Moreover, the introduced silicate enhanced the intrinsic electroconductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3 materials, as confirmed by both theoretical simulation and electrochemical measurements. After pairing with a commercial hard carbon anode, the optimized Na3V2(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1 cathode enabled a stable-cycling full cell with 90.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 5 C and a remarkable average coulombic efficiency of 99.88%.",

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (SIB) are among the most promising devices for large scale energy storage. Their stable and long-term performance depends on the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), a nanosized, heterogeneous and disordered layer, formed due to degradation of the electrolyte at the anode surface. The chemical and structural properties of the SEI control the charge transfer process at the electrode–electrolyte interface, thus, there is great interest in determining these properties for understanding, and ultimately controlling, SEI functionality. However, the study of the SEI is notoriously challenging due to its heterogeneous nature and minute quantity. In this work, we present a powerful approach for probing the SEI based on solid state NMR spectroscopy with increased sensitivity from dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). Utilizing exogenous (organic radicals) and endogenous (paramagnetic metal ion dopants) DNP sources, we obtain not only a detailed compositional map of the SEI but also, for the first time for the native SEI, determine the spatial distribution of its constituent phases. Using this approach, we perform a thorough investigation of the SEI formed on Li4Ti5O12 used as a SIB anode. We identify a compositional gradient, from organic phases at the electrolyte interface to inorganic phases toward the anode surface. We find that the use of fluoroethylene carbonate as an electrolyte additive leads to performance degradation which can be attributed to formation of a thicker SEI, rich in NaF and carbonates. We expect that this methodology can be extended to examine other titanate anodes and new electrolyte compositions, offering a unique tool for SEI investigations to enable the development of effective and long-lasting SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Zinc sulfide (ZnS) exhibits promise in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of its low operation voltage and high theoretical specific capacity. However, pristine ZnS is not adequate in realizing rapid and robust sodium storage owing to its low reversibility, poor structure stability, and sluggish kinetics. To date, most efforts focus on utilizing carbonaceous incorporation to improve its electrochemical performances. Nevertheless, it remains an arduous challenge for realizing superior rate capability while obtaining stable cycling. Herein, inspired by the crystal structure of hexagonal ZnIn2S4, which possesses an intrinsic layered feature with larger unit-cell volume versus that of ZnS, indium incorporation is thus deployed as an immediate remedy. In/ex situ investigations combined with density functional theory calculations are conducted to reveal the superior kinetics, high reversibility, and good structure stability of ZnIn2S4. Notably, the formed indium-based derivatives during cycling manifest a Na+ (de)intercalation process, thereby exciting a synergetic mechanism to stabilize electrochemical cycling. As a result, the electrochemical performances of Zn-based sulfide are significantly improved via the indium incorporation. Furthermore, a full cell based on the ZnIn2S4 anode with the superior electrochemical performance is developed. This work provides an effective tactic of heteroatom incorporation for optimizing structure as well as exciting a complementary reaction process toward developing superior anodes for high-performance alkali-ion batteries.",

Remarkably, an in situ magnetometry reveals that vast spin‐polarized electrons can be injected into superparamagnetic Fe nanoparticles (≈3 nm) formed during conversion reaction to induce evolution of electrode magnetization between 0.01 and 1 V, during which spin‐polarized surface capacitance effect occurs at Fe/Na2S interfaces to increase extra ion storage and boost ion transport stably. Consequently, the FeS/C yolk‐shell nanosheets deliver a high reversible capacity of 664.9 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, and 300.4 mAh g−1 after 10 000 cycles at 10 A g−1 with a capacity retention of 81.1%.",

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries are one of most promising alternatives to lithium ion batteries for large-scale energy storage, due to the high abundance and low cost of sodium in the earth. However, the lack of advanced electrode materials greatly affects their applications. Here, layered-structure SbPO4 is explored as an anode material for sodium ion batteries in terms of SbPO4 nanorods on reduced graphene oxide (SbPO4/rGO). In situ transmission electron microscopy images reveal the preferential expansion along the transverse direction of the nanorods upon the first discharging, which arises from the reduction of SbPO4 to Sb and the subsequent alloying of Sb as supported by in situ X-ray diffraction and selected area electron diffraction patterns. SbPO4/rGO exhibits a capacity retention of 99% after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g-1 both in half cells and in full cells. Its specific capacity at 5 A g-1 is 214 mA h g-1 in half cells or 134 mA h g-1 in full cells. Moreover, the energy density of the full cells at 1.2 kW kg-1total is still 99.8 W h kg-1total, very promising as an advanced electrode material.",

        "abstract": "In response to the increasing concern for energy management, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been extensively researched as an attractive anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The proficient cycling durability and good rate performance of SIBs are the two key parameters that determine their potential for practical use. In this study, nature-inspired three-dimensional (3D) MoS2 ultrathin marigold flower-like microstructures were prepared by a controlled hydrothermal method. These microscale flowers are constructed by arbitrarily arranged but closely interconnected two-dimensional ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets. The as-prepared MoS2 microflowers (MFs) have then been chemically wrapped by layered graphene sheets to form the bonded 3D hybrid MoS2-G networks. TEM, SEM, XRD, XPS, and Raman characterizations were used to study the morphology, crystallization, chemical compositions, and wrapping contact between MoS2 and graphene. The ultrathin nature of MoS2 in 3D MFs and graphene wrapping provide strong electrical conductive channels and conductive networks in an electrode. Benefitting from the 2 nm ultrathin crystalline MoS2 sheets, chemically bonded graphene, defect-induced sodium storage active sites, and 3D interstitial spaces, the prepared electrode exhibited an outstanding specific capacity (606 mA h g-1 at 200 mA g-1), remarkable rate performance (345 mA h g-1 at 1600 mA g-1), and long cycle life (over 100 cycles with tremendous Coulombic efficiencies beyond 100%).

        "abstract": "Porous carbon has been widely focused to solve the problems of low coulombic efficiency (ICE) and low multiplication capacity of Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) anodes. The superior energy storage properties of two-dimensional(2D) carbon nanosheets can be realized by modulating the structure, but be limited by the carbon sources, making it challenging to obtain 2D structures with large surface area. In this work, a new method for forming carbon materials with high N/S doping content based on combustion activation using the dual activation effect of K2 SO4 /KNO3 is proposed. The synthesized carbon material as an anode for SIBs has a high reversible capacity of 344.44 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 . Even at the current density of 5 Ag-1 , the capacity remained at 143.08 mAh g-1 . And the ICE of sodium-ion in ether electrolytes is ≈2.5 times higher than that in ester electrolytes. The sodium storage mechanism of ether/ester-based electrolytes is further explored through ex-situ characterizations. The disparity in electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the discrepancy in kinetics, wherein ether-based electrolytes exhibit a higher rate of Na+ storage and shedding compared to ester-based electrolytes. This work suggests an effective way to develop doubly doped carbon anode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Metal selenides, as potential alternative candidates for sodium storage, have promising applicability due to their high theoretical specific capacity. However, their huge volume change and sluggish electrode kinetics during sodium ion uptake and release processes can result in insufficient cycling life and inferior rate performance, hindering their practical application. Herein, nitrogen (N)-doped carbon-confined cobalt selenide anchored on multiwalled carbon nanotube networks (denoted as CoSe2@NC/MWCNTs) was designed and successfully built through a selenization process with ZIF-67 MOF as the template. The existence of the interconnected MWCNT network plays a crucial role in not only enhancing the electronic conductivity and ion/electron-transfer efficiency but also ensuring structural stability. Consequently, the optimized CoSe2@NC/MWCNTs composite delivers a high reversible capacity of 479.6 mA h g-1 at a current rate of 0.2 A g-1, accompanied by a 92.0% capacity retention over 100 cycles and a predominant rate performance of 227.4 mA h g-1 even under 20 A g-1 when examined as the anode in Na-ion batteries. Moreover, the kinetic behaviors were confirmed using CV profiles at various rates, as well as the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Besides, the HRTEM images clearly reveal the sodium-ion storage mechanism of the CoSe2 hybrid. These results make CoSe2@NC/MWCNTs a prospective anode material in advanced sodium-ion batteries.",

Nevertheless, the poor cycling stability and rate performance still impede its practical implantation. Here, CoSe2/nitrogen-doped carbon-skeleton hybrid microcubes with a TiO2 layer (denoted as TNC-CoSe2) are favorably prepared via a facile template-engaged strategy, in which a TiO2-coated Prussian blue analogue of Co3[Co(CN)6]2 is used as a new precursor accompanied with a selenization procedure. Such structures can concurrently boost ion and electron diffusion kinetics and inhibit the structural degradation during cycling through the close contact between the TiO2 layer and NC-CoSe2. Besides, this hybrid structure promotes the superior Na-ion intercalation pseudocapacitance due to the well-designed interfaces. The as-prepared TNC-CoSe2 microcubes exhibit a superior cycling capability (511 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 200 cycles) and long cycling life (456 mA h g-1 at 6.4 A g-1 for 6000 cycles with a retention of 92.7%).

Herein, we find that electrostatic modification of acidified carbon nanotubes with polyamines can introduce active sites and modulate the surface pH microenvironment, thereby developing a route to realize the in situ coaxial nanometerization of sodium titanate (nCNT@NTO). The nCNT@NTO anode material has a fast Na+ transport and the high capacitive contribution, which can deliver a high specific capacity (206.5 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1) and high rate performance (maintain 51% capacity at 10 A g-1), and the ideal cycle stability (∼93% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 5 A g-1). In addition, acrylate-rubber with high stickiness and stretchability are served as the elastic matrix both of the stretchable electrodes and quasi-solid-state electrolytes, which endows strong adhesion between electrodes and electrolytes. Thus, the accordingly assembled SSIC delivers high energy density of 8.8 mW h cm-3 (at a power density of 0.024 W cm-3), and excellent deformation stability (89% capacitance retention after 500 stretching cycles under 100% strain).",

All the cells are fabricated using Na3.1V2P2.9Si0.1O12, Na3.456Mg0.128Zr1.872Si2.2P0.8O12, and Na as a cathode AM, solid electrolyte (SE) and anode, respectively. The AM/SE interface is modified by (1) wetting the interface with organic liquid electrolyte (LE), (2) slurry casting and sintering a thin layer of composite cathode, and (3) infiltrating AM precursors inside the porous SE structure followed by drying and sintering. Despite exhibiting a stable cyclability performance, the SSBs prepared using the LE modification and composite cathode approach possess a low AM loading of < 1 mg·cm−2. On the other hand, the SSBs with infiltrated‐cathode exhibit a superior discharge capacity of ∼ 102 mAh·g−1 at 0.2C and less than 5% capacity fading after 50 cycles at room temperature. Notably, these cells contain a high AM loading of 2.12 mg·cm−2. The microstructural analysis reveals the presence of AM particles inside the pores of the porous SE, allowing for the efficient insertion/removal of sodium ions. The porous scaffold of SE not only provides continuous sodium‐ion conduction pathways inside the cathode structure but also renders stability by accommodating stress induced by volume change during repeated cycling. The outcomes of this work demonstrate the effectiveness of the wet‐chemical infiltration technique in improving the AM loading and storage capacity performance of SSBs working at 25°C.",

Fe3O4 quantum dots with an average size of 4.9 nm are anchored on the surface of 3D structured graphene nanosheets homogeneously. Such unique hierarchical structure are advantageous for enlarging the electrode/electrolyte interface area and enhancing the electrochemical activity of the hybrid materials, inhibiting particle aggregation of Fe3O4 and accommodating their volume change during the charging-discharging process as well as enabling fast diffusion of electrons and rapid transfer of electrolyte ions. Consequently, the 3D-0D graphene-Fe3O4 quantum dot hybrids exhibit ultrahigh sodium storage capacity (525 mAh g-1 at 30 mA g-1), outstanding cycling stability (312 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles at 50 mA g-1) and superior rate performance (56 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1).",

        "abstract": "Bimetallic SbSn alloy stands out among the anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of its high theoretical specific capacity (752 mAh g-1 ) and good electrical conductivity. However, the major challenge is the large volume change during cycling processes, bringing about rapid capacity decay. Herein, to cope with this issue, through electrostatic spinning and high temperature calcination reduction, the unique bean pod-like free-standing membrane is designed initially, filling SbSn dots into integrated carbon matrix including hollow carbon spheres and nitrogen-doped carbon fibers (B-SbSn/NCFs). Significantly, the synergistic carbon matrix not only improves the conductivity and flexibility, but provides enough buffer space to alleviate the large volume change of metal particles. More importantly, the B-SbSn/NCFs free-standing membrane can be directly used as the anode without polymer binder and conductive agent, which improves the energy density and reaction kinetics. Satisfyingly, the free-standing BSbSn/NCFs membrane anode shows excellent electrochemical performance in SIB. The specific capacity of the membrane electrode can maintain 486.9 mAh g-1 and the coulombic efficiency is close to 100% after 400 cycles at 100 mA g-1 . Furthermore, the full cell based on B-SbSn/NCFs anode also exhibits the good electrochemical performance.",

        "abstract": "Na-ion batteries (NIBs) have attracted increasing attention given the fact that sodium is relatively more plentiful and affordable than lithium for sustainable and large-scale energy storage systems. However, the shortage of electrode materials with outstanding comprehensive properties has limited the practical implementations of NIBs. Among all the discovered anode materials, transition-metal sulfide has been proven as one of the most competitive and promising ones due to its excellent redox reversibility and relatively high theoretical capacity. In this study, double-morphology N-doped CoS2/multichannel carbon nanofibers composites (CoS2/MCNFs) are precisely designed, which overcome common issues such as the poor cycling life and inferior rate performance of CoS2 electrodes. The conductive 3D interconnected multichannel nanostructure of CoS2/MCNFs provides efficient buffer zones for the release of mechanical stresses from Na+ ions intercalation/deintercalation. The synergy of the diverse structural features enables a robust frame and a rapid electrochemical reaction in CoS2/MCNFs anode, resulting in an impressive long-term cycling life of 900 cycles with a capacity of 620 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 (86.4% theoretical capacity) and a surprisingly high-power output.

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion hybrid supercapacitors (Na‐HSCs) by virtue of synergizing the merits of batteries and supercapacitors have attracted considerable attention for high‐energy and high‐power energy‐storage applications. Orthorhombic Nb2O5 (T‐Nb2O5) has recently been recognized as a promising anode material for Na‐HSCs due to its typical pseudocapacitive feature, but it suffers from intrinsically low electrical conductivity. Reasonably high electrochemical performance of T‐Nb2O5‐based electrodes could merely be gained to date when sufficient carbon content was introduced. In addition, flexible Na‐HSC devices have scarcely been demonstrated by far. Herein, an in situ encapsulation strategy is devised to directly grow ultrathin graphene shells over T‐Nb2O5 nanowires (denoted as Gr‐Nb2O5 composites) by plasma‐enhanced chemical vapor deposition, targeting a highly conductive anode material for Na‐HSCs. The few‐layered graphene capsules with ample topological defects would enable facile electron and Na+ ion transport, guaranteeing rapid pseudocapacitive processes at the Nb2O5/electrolyte interface. The Na‐HSC full‐cell comprising a Gr‐Nb2O5 anode and an activated carbon cathode delivers high energy/power densities (112.9 Wh kg−1/80.1 W kg−1 and 62.2 Wh kg−1/5330 W kg−1), outperforming those of recently reported Na‐HSC counterparts.

        "abstract": "Bismuth (Bi) have been demonstrated as promising anode for Na-ion batteries (NIBs) because it has high gravimetry (386 mAh g-1) and volumetric capacity (3800 mAh cm-3). However, Bi suffers from large volume expansion during sodiation, leading to poor electrochemical performance. Construction nanostructure with sufficient void space to accommodate the volume change has been proven effective for achieving prolonged cycling stability. But the excessive void space will definitely decrease the volumetric energy density of battery. Herein, we design an optimized Bi@Void@C nanospheres (Bi@Void@C-2) with yolk-shell structure that exhibits the best cycling performance and enhanced volumetric energy density. The optimized void space could not only buffer the volume change of the Bi nanosphere, but also could keep the high volumetric energy density of battery. The Bi@Void@C-2 shows an excellent rate capacity of 173 mAh g-1 at ultra-high current density of 100 A g-1 and long-cycle life (198 mAh g-1 at 20A g-1 over 10000 cycles). The origin of the superior performance is achieved through in-depth fundamental studies during battery operation using in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and in-situ transmission electron microscope (TEM), complemented by theoretical calculations and ex-situ TEM observation. Our rational design provides insights for anode materials with large volume variation, especially for conversion type and alloying type mechanism materials for batteries (i.e. Li-ion batteries, Na-ion batteries).",

Among the various electrolytes investigated, sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI) (0.5 M) in BMPTFSI shows the best electrochemical performance with a significant improvement in cycling stability (90% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 50 mA g-1 in a half cell versus Na metal anode) compared with conventional NaClO4 (1 M) in ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate electrolytes (39% retention after 500 cycles). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies reveal that ionic liquid electrolytes are stable up to 4.8 V versus Na/Na+. When NaFSI and NaTFSI are used as conducting salts, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results prove that the cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) is composed of components resulting from the decomposition of the TFSI anion and the deposition of the BMP cation. On the other hand, the CEI layer of the electrode cycled in an electrolyte containing NaClO4 in BMPTFSI follows a different pathway of TFSI decomposition and consists mainly of sodium fluoride. Similarly, plating studies were used to understand the stability of different ionic liquids in contact with metallic sodium. It was found that the excellent capacity retention for the electrolyte consisting of NaFSI salt is related to the formation of a stable CEI and solid electrolyte interphase layers.",

However, designing ideal functional superstructures with excellent electrochemical properties is still a major challenge, and an in-depth understanding of the structure-activity relationship of electrodes remains to be achieved. To elucidate this critical issue, herein, we rationally designed and synthesized for the first time superstructured TiO2/dual-doped mesoporous carbon anodes using confined space and surface coassembly strategies. Our method primarily relied on the larger interlayer space few-layered MXene and its negatively charged surface, allowing hexamethylenetetramine intercalation and surface electrostatic adsorption. The superstructured TiO2/dual-doped mesoporous carbon was successfully assembled by the thermal decomposition of a confined carbon precursor. Subsequently, the comparison of Na+-storage properties of various anodes was carried out based on the results of structural characterization techniques and electrochemical analysis methods. The results showed that the optimized anode (N/O-C@TiO2-20) can deliver a reversible capacity of 165 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g-1, indicating excellent electrochemical properties. The enhancement can be attributed to the synergistic effect of carbon domains, defective nanocrystals, and a covalently coupled interface between TiO2 and mesoporous carbon. Our work not only offered a new strategy for the assembly and regulation of superstructures to promote the electrochemical performance but also enlightened the rational design of advanced anodes for sodium-ion battery application.",

Herein, density functional theory simulations for the first time optimize MoS2 interlayer distance between 0.80 and 1.01 nm for sodium storage. 1-Butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium acetate ([BMIm]Ac) induces cellulose oligomers to intercalate MoS2 interlayers for achieving controllable distance by changing the mass ratio of cellulose to [BMIm]Ac. Based on these findings, porous carbon loading the interlayer-expanded MoS2 allowing Na+ to insert with fast kinetics is synthesized. A carbon layer derived from [BMIm]Ac and cellulose coating the composite prevents the MoS2 from contacting electrolytes, leading to less sulfur loss for a more reversible specific capacity. Meanwhile, MoS2 and carbon have a strong interfacial connection through MoN binding, contributing to enhanced structural stability. As expected, while cycling 250 times at 0.1 A g-1 , the MoS2 -porous carbon composite displays an optimal reversible capacity at 517.79 mAh g-1 as a sodium-ion batteries anode. The cyclic test of 1.0 A g-1 also shows considerable stability (310.74 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles with 86.26% retentive capacity).

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfides are attractive electrode materials for both lithium-ion (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Starting from micron-sized Co(IPC)·H2O (IPC: 4-(imidazole-1-yl) phthalic acid) and polydopamine as the metal-organic framework (MOF) precursor and carbon source, respectively, we produced a CoS2/C/C composite constituting CoS2 nanoparticles decorated with N-doped carbon layers and subjected to sulfurization. N-doped carbon layers provided a robust network for the CoS2 nanoparticles, enhancing the structural integrity and electronic conductivity of the resulting CoS2/C/C composite, which exhibited electrochemical performance superior to most existing CoS2 composites, and was one of the best among all MOF derived CoS2 anodes for LIBs and SIBs. The use of nanosized CoS2 particles reduced the diffusion length for the transfer of Li+/Na+ ions, resulting in a high specific capacity at a higher current rate. N-doped carbon layers derived from the MOF precursor and polydopamine provided an electrically conductive network between the CoS2 nanoparticles, thus preventing their aggregation and inhibiting adverse side reactions between the electrolyte and the surface of the electrode, and the high pseudocapacitive contribution resulted in the enhanced rate performance of the CoS2/C/C electrodes.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) is a promising anode material in alkali metal ion batteries owing to its cost-effectiveness, abundant sources, and low working voltage. However, challenges persist in achiving prolonged cycling stability and consistent capacity, and the sodium storage mechanism in HC is still debated. Herein, an unreported biomass precursor, \"sisal,\" for deriving hard carbon is developed. A series of sisal hemp-derived hard carbon with natural 3D porous channels are prepared. Through phase characterization and electrochemical testing, the relationship between microstructure and sodium storage capacity is elucidated, further confirming the suitability of the \"adsorption-insertion-filling\" mechanism for sodium storage properties in hard carbon materials. Without the need for any additional modification strategies, this biomass-derived hard carbon demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance in both sodium-ion and potassium-ion batteries (SIBs and PIBs). The as-prepared HC-1300 demonstrates excellent ion storage capability, delivering a high reversible capacity of 345.2 mAh g-1 in SIBs and 310 mAh g-1 in PIBs at 0.1 C. Moreover, it maintains a specific capacity of 237.3 mAh g-1 over 1200 cycles at 1 C when used in SIBs. The excellent cycling stability and superior rate performance are also presented in full cells, highlighting its potential for practical applications.",

The incorporation of OVs into TiO2 is demonstrated to render considerably enhanced-rate performances, higher initial capacities, and an accelerated electrochemical activation process during cycling, derived from the boosted intrinsic electric conductivity and improved kinetics of Na uptake. Bestowed with the integrated merits of OVs and shortened Na ion diffusion length in the nanostructure, black titania delivers a reversible specific capacity of 207.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, retains 99.1% over 500 cycles at 1 C stably, and still maintains 91.2 mAh g(-1) even at the high rate of 20 C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the lower sodiation energy barrier of anatase with OVs enables a more favorable Na intercalation into black anatase. Thus, it is of great significance to introduce OVs into TiO2 to stimulate ultrafast and durable sodium-storage properties, which also offers a potential strategy to project more superior electrodes, utilizing internal defects.",

Sb stands out from the potential candidates, due to high capacity, good electronic conductivity, and moderate sodiation voltage.

This structure has Sb nanorod as the core to increase the capacity and Ti-O-P as the shell to stabilize the interface between electrolyte and electrode material. The gap between the core and the shell accommodates the volume change during sodiation/desodiation. These features endow the structure outstanding performances. It could deliver a capacity of about 760 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at 500 mA g-1, with a capacity retention of about 94%. Even at 10 A g-1, the reversible capacity is still at 360 mA h g-1.

Herein, the first prototype planar sodium‐ion microcapacitors (NIMCs) are constructed based on the interdigital microelectrodes of urchin‐like sodium titanate as faradaic anode and nanoporous activated graphene as non‐faradaic cathode along with high‐voltage ionogel electrolyte on a single flexible substrate. By effectively coupling with battery‐type anode and capacitor‐type cathode, the resultant all‐solid‐state NIMCs working at 3.5 V exhibit a high volumetric energy density of 37.1 mWh cm−3 and an ultralow self‐discharge rate of 44 h from Vmax to 0.6 Vmax, both of which surpass most reported hybrid micro‐supercapacitors. Through tuning graphene layer covered on the top surface of interdigital microelectrodes, the NIMCs unveil remarkably enhanced power density, owing to the establishment of favorable multidirectional fast ion diffusion pathways that significantly reduce the charge transfer resistance. Meanwhile, the as‐fabricated NIMCs present excellent mechanical flexibility without capacitance fade under repeated deformation, and electrochemical stability at a high temperature of 80 °C because of using nonflammable ionogel electrolyte and in‐plane geometry.

All composites show enhancement in the overall capacity and cycling stability compared to the pristine CuP2 due to the well‐connected CNTs on and between the CuP2 particles. At a high currency density of 1 A g−1, CuP2@SWCNTs composite with 13 wt.% SWCNTs can deliver a specific capacity over 400 mAh g−1 for more than 60 cycles, much better than conventional hard carbon materials. The CNTs enhance the conductivity and reduce capacity loss caused by the volume variation of CuP2 based electrode materials. Post‐mortem analysis by scanning electron microscopy depicts a possible battery failure mechanism, whereby the solid electrolyte interface exists in the form of nanospheres distributing at the surface of the electrode.

However, the intrinsic pulverization and aggregation of iron sulfide electrodes induced by the conversion reaction during cycling are considered destructive and undesirable, which often impedes their capacity, rate capability, and long-term cycling stability. Herein, an interesting pulverization phenomenon of ultrathin carbon-coated Fe1- xS nanoplates (Fe1- xS@C) is observed during the first discharge process of sodium-ion batteries, which leads to the formation of Fe1- xS nanoparticles with quantum size (≈5 nm) tightly embedded in the carbon matrix. Surprisingly, no discernible aggregation phenomenon can be detected in subsequent cycles. In/ex situ experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrate that ultrafine pulverization can confer several advantages, including sustaining reversible conversion reactions, reducing the adsorption energies, and diffusion energy barriers of sodium atoms, and preventing the aggregation of Fe1- xS particles by strengthening the adsorption between pulverized Fe1- xS nanoparticles and carbon. As a result, benefiting from the unique ultrafine pulverization, the Fe1- xS@C anode simultaneously exhibits high reversible capacity (610 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1), superior rate capability (427.9 mAh g-1 at 20 A g-1), and ultralong cycling stability (377.9 mAh g-1 after 2500 cycles at 20 A g-1).",

Introducing sacrificial cathode presodiation agents, particularly those that own potential anionic oxidation activity with a high theoretical capacity, can provide additional sodium sources for compensating Na loss. Herein, Ni atoms are precisely implanted at the Na sites within Na2O framework, obtaining a (Na0.89Ni0.05□0.06)2O (Ni-Na2O) presodiation agent. The synergistic interaction between Na vacancies and Ni catalyst effectively tunes the band structure, forming moderate Ni-O covalent bonds, activating the oxidation activity of oxygen anion, reducing the decomposition overpotential to 2.8 V (vs Na/Na+), and achieving a high presodiation capacity of 710 mAh/g≈Na2O (Na2O decomposition rate >80%). Incorporating currently-modified presodiation agent with Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na2/3Ni2/3Mn1/3O2 cathodes, the energy density of corresponding Na-ion full-cells presents an essential improvement of 23.9% and 19.3%, respectively.

        "abstract": "Antimony is an attractive anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to its high theoretical capacity and appropriate sodiation potential. However, its practical application is severely impeded by its poor cycling stability caused by dramatic volumetric variations during sodium uptake and release processes. Here, to circumvent this obstacle, Sb@C@TiO2 triple-shell nanoboxes (TSNBs) are synthesized through a template-engaged galvanic replacement approach. The TSNB structure consists of an inner Sb hollow nanobox protected by a conductive carbon middle shell and a TiO2 -nanosheet-constructed outer shell. This structure offers dual protection to the inner Sb and enough room to accommodate volume expansion, thus promoting the structural integrity of the electrode and the formation of a stable solid-electrolyte interface film. Benefiting from the rational structural design and synergistic effects of Sb, carbon, and TiO2 , the Sb@C@TiO2 electrode exhibits superior rate performance (212 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 ) and outstanding long-term cycling stability (193 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 4000 cycles). Moreover, a full cell assembled with a configuration of Sb@C@TiO2 //Na3 (VOPO4 )2 F displays a high output voltage of 2.8 V and a high energy density of 179 Wh kg-1 , revealing the great promise of Sb@C@TiO2 TSNBs as the electrode in SIBs.",

        "abstract": "In order to develop promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), a novel pie-like FeS@C (P-FeS@C) nanohybrid, in which all ultrasmall FeS nanocrystals (NCs) are completely embedded into the carbon network and sealed by a protective carbon shell, has been prepared. The unique pie-like structure can effectively speed up the kinetics of electrode reactions, while the carbon shell stabilizes the FeS NCs inside. Studies show that the electrochemical reaction processes of P-FeS@C electrodes are dominated by the pseudocapacitive behavior, leading to an ultrafast Na+-insertion/extraction reaction. Hence, the prepared P-FeS@C nanohybrid exhibits superior Na-storage properties especially high rate capability in half cells. For example, it can deliver reversible capacities of 555.1 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 over 150 cycles and about 60.4 mA h g-1 at 80 A g-1 (an ultrahigh current density even higher than that of the capacitor test). Furthermore, an advanced P-FeS@C//Na3V2(PO4)2O2F full cell has been assembled out, which delivers a stable specific capacity of 441.2 mA h g-1 after 80 cycles at 0.5 A g-1 with a capacity retention of 91.8%.",

However, challenges in removing defects and improving the insertion of sodium ions head off the development of hard carbon to achieve this goal. Herein, a highly cross‐linked topological graphitized carbon using biomass corn cobs through a two‐step rapid thermal‐annealing strategy is reported. The topological graphitized carbon constructed with long‐range graphene nanoribbons and cavities/tunnels provides a multidirectional insertion of sodium ions whilst eliminating defects to absorb sodium ions at the high voltage region. Evidence from advanced techniques including in situ XRD, in situ Raman, and in situ/ex situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicates that the sodium ions' insertion and Na cluster formation occurred between curved topological graphite layers and in the topological cavity of adjacent graphite band entanglements. The reported topological insertion mechanism enables outstanding battery performance with a single full low‐voltage plateau capacity of 290 mAh g−1, which is almost 97% of the total capacity.",

        "title": "Manipulating Interfacial Renovation via In Situ Formed Metal Fluoride Heterogeneous Protective Layer toward Exceptional Durable Sodium Metal Anodes",
        "abstract": "Sodium metal is regarded as an optimal anode material for high‐energy‐density sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, during the processes of sodium deposition and stripping, the failure of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film leads to the continuous accumulation of inactive sodium, thereby compromising the cycling reversibility of the battery. Here, a novel metal fluoride heterointerface layer is generated and constructed through in situ manipulation of the continuous reaction between TiF4 and metal Na. The reconstructed NaF/TiF3 interface layer, which tightly anchors the sodium metal, effectively suppresses the formation of sodium dendrites during the charge‐discharge process. The highly sodium‐philic TiF3 component exhibits strong binding with Na ions, while NaF reduces the Na+ diffusion energy barrier, significantly enhancing the reaction kinetics. Due to the successful artificial construction of this interface layer, the Na/TiF4 composite electrode demonstrates an exceptional ultra‐long cycling stability of 2370 h in symmetric cells (0.5 mAh cm−2). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further validate the functionality of each component in the Na/TiF4 protective layer. When paired with NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode in a pouch cell, it exhibits stability up to 2000 cycles at current densities of 2 C and 4 C, with a maximum energy density output of 483.1 Wh kg−1 (power density: 320.8 W kg−1).",

However, the huge volume changes during a charge/discharge process and poor conductivity of FeS2 hindered its practical applications. Herein, we propose a facile scalable approach to prepare nanostructured FeS2 embedded in an N-doped carbon nanosheet composite (FeS2/CNS) via a combined template method and a solid state sulfuration method. N-Doped carbon nanosheets are believed to alleviate the volume variation and enhance the conductivity of an electrode, and the nanoscale particle size with an average diameter of 50-80 nm can shorten the ion-diffusion paths during a sodiation/desodiation process. As a result, the FeS2/CNS electrode exhibits high specific capacity (812 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), long cycling life (77.2% capacity retention after 350 cycles at 1 A g-1) and excellent rate capability (400 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1) when tested as an anode material for SIBs.

        "abstract": "Phosphorus represents a promising anode material for sodium ion batteries owing to its extremely high theoretical capacity. Recent in situ transmission electron microscopy studies evidenced anisotropic swelling in sodiated black phosphorus, which may find an origin from the two intrinsic anisotropic properties inherent to the layered structure of black phosphorus: sodium diffusional directionality and insertion strain anisotropy. To understand the morphological evolution and stress generation in sodiated black phosphorus, we develop a chemo-mechanical model by incorporating the intrinsic anisotropic properties into the large elasto-plastic deformation. Our modeling results reveal that the apparent morphological evolution in sodiated black phosphorus is critically controlled by the coupled effect of the two intrinsic anisotropic properties. In particular, sodium diffusional directionality generates sharp interphases along the [010] and [001] directions, which constrain anisotropic development of the insertion strain. The coupled effect renders distinctive stress-generation and fracture mechanisms when sodiation starts from different crystal facets. In addition to providing a powerful modeling framework for sodiation and lithiation of layered structures, our findings shed significant light on the sodiation-induced chemo-mechanical degradation of black phosphorus as a promising anode for the next-generation sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The kinetics incompatibility between battery-type anode and capacitive-type cathode for sodium ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) seriously hinders their overall performance output. Herein, we construct a SIHCs device by coupling with quantum grade vanadium nitride (VN) nanodots anchored in one-dimensional N/F co-doped carbon nanofiber cages hybrids (VNQDs@PCNFs-N/F) as the freestanding anode and the corresponding activated N/F co-doped carbon nanofiber cages (APCNFs-N/F) as cathode. The strong coupling of VN quantum dots with N/F co-doped 1D conductive carbon cages effectively facilitates the ion/electron transport and intercalation-conversion-deintercalation reactions, ensuring fast sodium storage to surmount aforesaid kinetics incompatibility. Additionally, density functional theory calculations cogently manifest that the abundant active sites in the VNQDs@PCNFs-N/F configuration boost the Na+ adsorption/reaction activity well which will promote both \"intrinsic\" and \"extrinsic\" pseudocapacitance and further improve anode kinetics. Consequently, the assembled SIHCs device can achieve high energy densities of 157.1 and 95.0 Wh kg-1 at power densities of 198.8 and 9100.5 W kg-1, respectively, with an ultralong cycling life over 8000 cycles.

        "abstract": "The rise of Na‐storage devices has put forward higher requirements for Na‐storage anode materials with large capacity, long service life, and fast rate capability. Mesoporous carbons, either as active materials or as hosts for guest active nanoparticles, are considered as promising electrode materials. However, addressing the issues of their short lifespan resulting from volume variation and the low coulombic efficiency caused by large surface area via a facile porous structure design still remains a challenge. Herein, a versatile phosphorus‐doped mesoporous carbon (PMC) armed is developed by graphene aerogel (GA) (GA@PMC) for hosting Na‐storage active nanoparticles. As a case study, FeSe2 nanoparticles are selectively supported onto this GA@PMC matrix, creating the FeSe2/GA@PMC composite. When employed in typical Na‐storage devices, such as Na‐ion batteries, Na‐ion hybrid capacitors, and Na‐ion based dual‐ion batteries, the FeSe2/GA@PMC electrode consistently demonstrates superior electrochemical performance. In such GA@PMC, the conformal GA can improve the entire conductivity while decreasing the specific surface area that is directly contacting with electrolyte. The interconnected macroporous structure can not only promote the diffusion of Na+ but also buffers the volume change of the guest active nanoparticles. This bespoke carbon platform synergistically endows the electrode material with enhanced rate capability, cyclic stability, and coulombic efficiency, which are being expected in advanced Na‐storage devices.",

Notably, the synergetic effect of the heterogeneous structure is maximized by inducing the interfacial coupling SbOC and creating buffering space for the volume effect of Sb. The high-entropy phase interface creates the doping site breaking the periodicity of atoms and alters the electronic structure, also bridging the slip of intergranular defects. Thus, the electronic conductivity and phase interface structural stability are reinforced.

The results demonstrate that ball-milled hard carbon with more defects and smaller microcrystalline size shows less low-potential-plateau capacity and lower ICE, which provides further evidence to the \"adsorption-insertion\" mechanism.

Herein, we propose the sodiation/desodiation reaction mechanism of 2D few-layer antimonene (FLA) based on results acquired by in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, ex situ selected-area electron diffraction, and theoretical simulations. Our study shows that the FLA undergoes anisotropic volume expansion along the a/b plane and exhibits reversible crystalline phase evolution (Sb ⇋ NaSb ⇋ Na3Sb) during cycling. Density-functional theory calculations demonstrate that the FLA has a small Na-ion diffusion barrier of 0.14 eV. The FLA delivers a larger capacity of 642 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C (1 C = 660 mA g-1) and a high rate capability of 429 mAh g-1 at 5 C and maintains a stable capacity of 620 mA g-1 at 0.5 C with 99.7% capacity retention from the 10th to the 150th cycle. Considering the 660 mAh g-1 theoretical capacity of Sb, the electrochemical utilization of Sb atoms of FLA is as high as 93.9% at a rate of 0.5 C for over 150 cycles, which is the highest capacity and Sb utilization ratio reported so far.

        "abstract": "Pillared MXenes with large interlayer spacing have shown great potential as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). To better understand the underlying mechanism of the pillar effect in enhancing the electrochemical performance, first-principles calculations were used to investigate the adsorption and diffusion of Na in MXenes (Ti2CO2 and Ti3C2O2), as well as the mechanical properties of the system under different MXenes layer spacings. The results showed that when the MXene layer spacing was ∼4 Å, the strongest adsorption of Na on MXenes was achieved due to the interlayer synergy effect. However, when the MXene layer spacing was greater than 5 Å, double Na-atomic layer adsorption would be formed, which increased the Na storage capacity. Interestingly, the diffusion of Na was not only affected by the interlayer spacing of MXenes, but also by the interlayer stacking mode of MXenes. Moreover, it was found that when the MXene layer spacing was more than 8 Å, the sodium storage properties basically did not change significantly. The optimal layer spacing for Ti2CO2 and Ti3C2O2 was predicted to be 7 and 6 Å, respectively. This work provides valuable theoretical guidance for developing high-performance anode materials for SIBs.",

However, their cycling performance is limited by large volume variation, severe aggregation, and pulverization of bimetallic oxide nanoparticles during repeated metal ion insertion/extraction processes. Herein, bimetallic antimony-vanadium oxide nanoparticles embedded in graphene (SbVO4/G) composites are prepared by a one-step hydrothermal method. Bimetallic SbVO4 with abundant redox reaction sites can provide high specific capacity by a multi-electron reaction. A robust graphene substrate can not only alleviate volume expansion but also prevent aggregation and collapse of highly active bimetallic SbVO4. Due to the excellent synergy between the two building components, SbVO4/G hybrids exhibit excellent electrochemical activity, structural stability, and electrochemical performance. When employed as anodes for LIBs and SIBs, SbVO4/G composites display excellent cycling performance (1079.5 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 150 cycles for LIBs and 401.6 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 450 cycles for SIBs) and impressive rate capability.

As expected, Vs-SMS@C releases an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 1089 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 , higher than the theoretical capacity.

        "abstract": "Sodium-metal batteries, heralded for high energy density and cost-effectiveness, are compromised by an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and dendrite formation, which hinder practical applications. Herein, a zirconium-based metal-organic framework nanostructure coating (ZMOF-NSC) was constructed in a low-loss, flexible manner. Comprehensive studies show that ZMOF-NSC, with its periodically ordered nanochannels and organized pore structures, enhances ion transport and decreases the Na+ migration energy barrier, thus ensuring uniform ion flux and achieving uniform spherical deposition. Additionally, ZMOF-NSC facilitates partial desolvation, catalyzing the formation of an inorganic-rich, dual-layered SEI that effectively protects the anode and suppresses dendrite formation. Consequently, the ZMOF-NSC@Na symmetric battery exhibits an impressive lifespan of over 2500 h, demonstrating extended operational longevity. The Na3V2(PO4)3∥ZMOF-NSC@Na batteries demonstrate exceptional cycling stability with 81% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 10 C, maintaining stability over 3000 cycles at 20 C. Moreover, the NVP∥ZMOF-NSC@Na battery achieves an energy density of 370 Wh kg-1 and a power density of 10,484 W kg-1, indicating superior durability and performance. This significant finding highlights the significant potential of structured MOFs to induce a dual-layered SEI, advancing the commercialization of durable, dendrite-free sodium metal batteries.

In this paper, we make nanooctahedra particles assembled FeSe2 microspheres embedded into sulfur-doped reduced graphene oxide sheets through a one-step hydrothermal reduction route, in which the reduction of graphene oxide, the doping of sulfur atoms, and the preparation of FeSe2/sulfur-doped reduced graphene oxide (FeSe2/SG) composites are realized at the same time. When serving as anodes for SIBs, the FeSe2/SG electrode can display superior electrochemical performances with a large reversible capacity of 447.5 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) and an excellent rate capability of 383.3 and 277.5 mA h g(-1) at the current density of 2.0 and 5.0 A g(-1), which could be attributed to the introduction of sulfur atoms into the reduced graphene oxide structure and the synergistic effect between microsphere-like FeSe2 particles and sulfur-doped reduced graphene oxide sheets.",

Herein, we propose a wide-temperature SIB, which involves a carbon-coated Na 4 Fe 3 (PO 4 ) 2 P 2 O 7 (NFPP@C) cathode, a Bismuth (Bi) anode, and a diglyme-based electrolyte. We demonstrate that solvated Na + can be directly stored by the Bi anode via an alloying reaction without the de-solvent process.  Furthermore, the NFPP@C cathode exhibits a high Na + diffusion coefficient at low temperature. As a result, the Bi//NFPP@C battery exhibits perfect low-temperature behavior. Even at -70 °C, this battery still delivers 70.19% of the room-temperature capacity. Furthermore, benefitting from the high boiling point of the electrolyte, this battery also works well at a high temperature up to 100 °C. These encourage results might shed light on the exploration of wide-temperature SIBs.",

We report a sodium storage mechanism and properties of a new anode material, digenite Cu1.8S, based on its crystallographic study. It is revealed that copper sulfides (Cu xS) can have metal-rich formulas ( x ≥ 1.6), due to the unique oxidation state of +1 found in group 11 elements. These phases enable the unit cell to consist of all strong Cu-S bonds and no direct S-S bonds, which are vulnerable to external stress/strain that could result in bond cleavage as well as decomposition. Because of its structural rigidness, the Cu1.8S shows an intercalation/deintercalation reaction mechanism even in a low potential window of 0.1-2.2 V versus Na/Na+ without irreversible phase transformation, which most of the metal sulfides experience through a conversion reaction mechanism. It uptakes, on average, 1.4 Na+ ions per unit cell (∼250 mAh g-1) and exhibits ∼100% retention over 1000 cycles at 2C in a tuned voltage range of 0.5-2.2 V through an overall solid solution reaction with negligible phase separation.",

        "abstract": "As a potential alternative to lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted more and more attention due to the lower cost of sodium than lithium. Red phosphorus (RP) is an especially promising anode for SIBs with the highest theoretical capacity of 2596 mAh g-1, which faces the challenges of large volume change and low conductivity. Herein, we develop a nanoporous RP on reduced graphene oxide (NPRP@RGO) as a high-performance anode for SIBs through boiling. Its nanoporous structure could accommodate the volume change and minimize the ion diffusion length, and the high electronic conductive network built on RGO sheets facilitates the fast electron and ion transportation. As a result, NPRP@RGO exhibits a superhigh capacity (1249.7 mAh gcomposite-1 after 150 cycles at 173.26 mA gcomposite-1), superior rate capability (656.9 mAh gcomposite-1 at 3465.28 mA gcomposite-1), and ultralong cycle life at 5.12 A gRP-1 for RP-based electrodes (775.3 mAh gRP-1 after 1500 cycles).

        "abstract": "Unordered vacancies engineered in host anode materials cannot well maintain the uniform Na+ adsorbed and possibly render the local structural stress intense, resulting in electrode peeling and battery failure. Here, the indium is first introduced into Cu2Se to achieve the formation of CuInSe2. Next, an ion extraction strategy is employed to fabricate Cu0.54In1.15Se2 enriched with ordered vacancies by spontaneous formation of defect pairs. Such ordered defects, compared with unordered ones, can serve as myriad sodium ion micropumps evenly distributing in crystalline host to homogenize the adsorbed Na+ and the generated volumetric stress during the electrochemistry. Furthermore, Cu0.54In1.15Se2 is indeed proved by the calculations to exhibit smaller volumetric variation than the counterpart with unordered vacancies. Thanks to the distinct ordered vacancy structure, the material exhibits a highly reversible capacity of 428 mAh g−1 at 1 C and a high‐rate stability of 311.7 mAh g−1 at 10 C after 5000 cycles when employed as an anode material for Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). This work presents the promotive effect of ordered vacancies on the electrochemistry of SIBs and demonstrates the superiority to unordered vacancies, which is expected to extend it to other metal‐ion batteries, not limited to SIBs to achieve high capacity and cycling stability.",

Thereinto, Fe3S4 has a high theoretical specific capacity of 785 mAh g−1. However, at present, the research related to Fe3S4 anode for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) is still in its infancy, and it also suffers from severe volume expansion and limited preparation. Therefore, to further boost its sodium storage potential, the Fe3S4@rGO composite with hierarchical structure and carbonaceous network is proposed in this study. Beneficial from the ingenious hierarchitectures and flexible graphene coating, the Fe3S4@rGO anode exhibits outstanding sodium storage performance, which can deliver a high capacity of 603 mAh g−1 after 1500 cycles with a superior capacity retention of 98%. The micron flower‐like structure composed of 2D nanosheets can provide sufficient active sites and promote the rapid transport of Na+. Meanwhile, the 3D interconnected graphene carbon network makes a crucial contribution to alleviating volume changes and enhancing electrical conductivity.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are currently the most promising candidates for large-scale energy storage devices owing to their low cost and abundant resources. Titanium-based layered oxides have attracted widespread attention as promising anode materials due to delivering a safe potential of about 0.7 V (vs Na+/Na) and a small volume contraction during cycles; P2-type Ti-based layered oxides are typically reported, due to the challenging synthesis of the O3-type counterpart resulting from the high percentage of unstable Ti3+. Herein, we report an anomalous O3-Na2/3Ni1/3Ti2/3O2 layered oxide as an ultrastable and high-rate anode material for SIBs. The anode material delivers a reversible capacity of 112 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles at 0.1 C, a good capacity retention rate of 91% after 1400 cycles at 2 C, and, in particular, a capacity of 52 mA h g-1 even at a high rate of 20 C (1780 mA g-1). Furthermore, the in situ X-ray diffraction monitoring reveals no phase transitions and almost zero strain both underlie the good long-cycle stability. The measured high apparent Na+ diffusion coefficient (2.06 × 10-10 cm2 s-1) and the low migration energy barrier (0.59 eV) from density functional theory calculations are responsible for the superior rate capability. Our results promise advanced high-performance O3-type Ti-based layered oxides as promising anode materials toward application for SIBs.",

However, low electronic conductivity, severe particle agglomeration and lack of effective synthesis methods have still greatly hampered their rapid development. Herein, we initially fabricate a novel VSe1.5/CNF composite through a facile electrospinning method followed by selenization. The electrochemical measurements show that VSe1.5/CNFs can enable the rapid and durable storage of Li+, Na+, and K+ ions. When used as an anode material for LIBs, the VSe1.5/CNF composite delivers a high capacity of 932 mA h g-1 after 400 cycles at a high current density of 1 A g-1. In addition, for SIBs, the VSe1.5/CNF composite manifests a high reversible capacity of 668 mA h g-1 after 50 cycles and an excellent capacity of 265 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1 even after an ultra-long 6000 cycles. This is one of the best performances of vanadium-based anode materials for SIBs reported so far. Most remarkably, the VSe1.5/CNF composite also demonstrates a satisfactory reversible K+ storage performance. The simple synthetic route and excellent ion storage properties make the VSe1.5/CNF composite a great prospect for application as an anode material for alkali metal ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Low Na+ and electron diffusion kinetics severely restrain the rate capability of MoS2 as anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Slow phase transitions between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S as well as the volume change during cycling, induce a poor cycling stability. Herein, an original Fe single atom doped MoS2 hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) is designed for the first time to address the above challenges. The Fe single atom in MoS2 promotes the electron transfer, companying with shortened charge diffusion path from unique HoMS, thereby achieving excellent rate capability. The strong adsorption with Na+ and self-catalysis of Fe single atom facilitates the reversible conversion between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S. Moreover, the buffering effect of HoMS on volume change during cycling improves the cyclic stability. Consequently, the Fe single atom doped MoS2 quadruple-shelled sphere exhibits a high specific capacity of 213.3 mAh g-1 at an ultrahigh current density of 30 A g-1, which is superior to previously-reported results. Even at 5 A g-1, 259.4 mAh g-1 (83.68 %) was reserved after 500 cycles. Such elaborate catalytic site decorated HoMS is also promising to realize other \"fast-charging\" high-energy-density rechargeable batteries.",

Herein, we selected a splendid host microcrystalline graphite (MG) to synthesize an AlCl3 intercalated MG intercalation compound (AlCl3-MGIC) anode material and demonstrated that it is suitable for SIBs via electrolyte optimization. The AlCl3-MGIC electrode is primarily compared in four electrolytes. Sodium storage is proposed for co-intercalation and conversion reactions by simultaneously selecting a compatible NaPF6/diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME) electrolyte. As a result, the AlCl3-MGIC anode delivers a specific capacity of 202 mA h g-1 at a current density of 0.2 A g-1 after 100 cycles and still exhibits a satisfactory capacity of 198 mA h g-1 after 900 cycles. Density functional theory calculations further illustrate that DEGDME solvent molecules offer moderate adsorption energy to sodium ions that guarantees structure stabilization of GICs during repeated cycling. This work provides a theoretical basis for designing sodium ion storage with a graphite layered structure and unveiling the prospects of MC-GIC materials as high-performance anodes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are postulated as sustainable energy storage devices for light electromobility and stationary applications. The anode of choice in SIBs is hard carbon (HC) due to its electrochemical performance. Among different HC precursors, bio‐waste resources have attracted significant attention due to their low‐cost, abundance, and sustainability. Many bio‐waste materials have been used as HC precursors, but they often require strong acids/bases for pre‐/post‐treatment for HC development. Here, the morphology, microstructure, and electrochemical performance of HCs synthesized from hazelnut shells subjected to different pre‐treatments (i. e., no pre‐treatment, acid treatment, and water washing) were compared. The impact on the electrochemical performance of sodium‐ion cells and the cost‐effectiveness were also investigated. The results revealed that hazelnut shell‐derived HCs produced via simple water washing outperformed those obtained via other processing methods in terms of electrochemical performance and cost–ecological effectiveness of a sodium‐ion battery pack.",

One of the boosters for accelerating the practical application of sodium-ion batteries is the innovation in anode materials. This study focuses on developing a high-performance hard carbon anode material derived from hydroxymethylfurfural, produced from carbohydrates, using a straightforward thermal condensation method. The process results in a unique pseudo-graphitic material with abundant microporosity. Electrochemical evaluations demonstrate excellent sodium storage performance by maintaining the plateau capacity even at higher current densities. This translates to a promising energy density when coupled with the cathode material.

Tungsten disulfide (WS2 ) nanosheets are confined, through synergistic anchoring, on the surface and inside of hollow beaded carbon nanofibers (HB CNFs) via a hydrothermal reaction method to construct the hierarchical structure HB WS2 @CNFs. Benefiting from this unique advantage, HB WS2 @CNFs exhibits remarkable lithium-storage performance in terms of high rate capability (≈351 mAh g-1 at 2 A g-1 ) and stable long-term cycle (≈446 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 100 cycles). Moreover, as an anode material for SIBs, HB WS2 @CNFs obtains excellent long cycle life and rate performance. During the charging/discharging process, the evolution of morphology and composition of the composite are analyzed by a set of ex situ methods.

Copper selenides have established themselves as potential anode materials for SIBs due to their high theoretical capacity and good conductivity. However, the poor rate performance and fast capacity fading are the major challenges to their practical application in SIBs. Herein, single-crystalline CuSe2 nanocubes (CuSe2 NCs) are successfully synthesized via a solvothermal method. As an anode of SIBs, the CuSe2 NCs render an almost 100% initial Coulombic efficiency, an outstanding long cycle life, e.g., 380 mA h g-1 after 1700 cycles at 10 A g-1, and an unprecedented rate performance of 344 mA h g-1 at 50 A g-1. Ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns reveal the crystalline transformation of energy-storage materials, and the density functional theory (DFT) conclusion suggests that fast and stable ion diffusion kinetics enhances their electrochemical performance upon sodiation/desodiaton.

In addition, our strategy involves three processes, a tunable organic polyreaction, a thermal annealing process, and a cost-effective reduction reaction. The as-prepared Sb/NPC electrode demonstrates a great reversible capacity of 529.6 mA h g-1 and an outstanding cycling stability with 97.2% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 100 mA g-1. Even at 1600 mA g-1, a superior rate capacity of 357 mA h g-1 can be retained.

Herein, hard carbons from a sustainable biomass feedstock (vine shoots) were synthesized via a simple two‐step carbonization process at different highest temperatures to be used as anodes in SIBs. The hard carbon produced at 1200 °C delivered the highest reversible capacity (270 mAh g–1 at 0.03 A g–1, with an acceptable initial coulombic efficiency of 71%) since a suitable balance between the pseudographitic domains growth and the retention of microporosity, defects, and functional groups was achieved. A prominent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 97% over 315 cycles was also attained. Comprehensive characterization unraveled a three‐stage sodium storage mechanism based on adsorption, intercalation, and filling of pores. A remarkable specific capacity underestimation of up to 38% was also found when a two‐electrode half‐cell configuration was employed to measure the rate performance. To avoid this systematic error caused by the counter/reference electrode polarization, we strongly recommend the use of a three‐electrode setup or a full‐cell configuration to correctly evaluate the anode response at moderate and high current rates.",

        "abstract": "Cost concerns have promoted the rise of Na-based batteries as an alternative to Li-based batteries, and the energy density pursuits have brought attention to Na metal anodes. Numerous studies have been conducted on the failure mechanisms and improvement methods of Na metal batteries (NMBs) at room temperature; however, the low-temperature applications are still faced with more complex challenges. On the basis of the concentration effect of the electrolytes, we propose a dilute electrolyte for the low-temperature operation of NMBs. With the low salt concentration and tetrahydrofuran cosolvent, the affinity between Na ions and the solvent molecules is weakened to achieve fast reaction kinetics at low temperatures. The designed electrolyte enables an effectively decreased cell impedance, which improves the cycling stability of Na symmetric cells. As a result, the full cell paired with the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode maintains a capacity of 80 mAh/g over 250 cycles at -20 °C.

Herein, an SnSe/FLG (few-layer graphene) composite with high tap density (2.3 g cm-3) is synthesized via plasma milling method, in which SnSe nanoparticles are strongly bound with the FLG matrix, owing to both Sn-C and Se-C bonds, to form nanosized primary particles and then assemble to microsized secondary granules. The FLG can effectively alleviate the large stress generated from volume expansion of SnSe during cycling, based on its superstrength. Furthermore, as demonstrated by the density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, the Sn-C and Se-C co-bonding benefitting from the formation of substantial vacancy defects on the P-milling synthesized FLG enables strong affinity between SnSe nanoparticles and FLG matrix, preventing SnSe from aggregating and detaching even after long-term cycling.

As the anode material of the SIBs, the unique structure of OL-VMS not only facilitated the rapid migration of sodium ions between the stacked layers but also provided a stable framework for the volume change in the process of intercalation/deintercalation. In addition, vanadium mediating in the framework caused more defects to produce abundant storage sites for Na+. As such, the obtained OL-VMS-based anode exhibited high reversible capacities of 602.9 mAh g-1 at 0.2 mA g-1 and 534 mAh g-1 even after 190-cycle operation at 2 A g-1. Furthermore, the OL-VMS-based anode delivered an outstanding specific capacity of 626.4 mAh g-1 after 100-cycle testing at 2 A g-1 in a voltage range from 0.01 to 3 V. In particular, even in the absence of conductive carbon, it still showed an excellent specific capacity of 260 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 130 cycles in a 0.3-3 V voltage range, which should contribute to the cost reduction and energy density increase.",

        "abstract": "In this study, V5+ doped sodium titanate nanorods were successfully synthesized by a sol-gel method with different optimized vanadium concentrations. Before testing as a promising anode material for sodium ion battery (SIB) application, the samples were systematically characterized. It was clearly observed that V5+ doping significantly affects the phase formation of sodium titanate samples and leads to the alteration of the major phase of Na2Ti3O7 to a single Na2Ti6O13 phase with increasing doping concentrations. Electrochemical investigations clearly showed that the optimized 15 wt% V5+ doped sample exhibits the highest capacity of 136 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 900 cycles as well as better rate capability than the undoped sample by delivering 101 mA h g-1 capacity at a high current density of 1000 mA g-1. It is believed that the incorporation of highly charged V5+ in sodium titanate produces oxygen vacancies along with partial reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+, resulting in improved electronic conductivity. The utilization of oxygen vacancies also preserves the integrity of the electrode, giving rise to long term cycling. Thereby, V5+ doping was found to be an effective strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of the sodium titanate anode for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Inferior rate performance, insufficient cycle life, and low mass loading have restricted the practical application of hard carbon (HC) anodes in sodium-ion batteries (NIBs). Here, a compatible strategy is developed by matching HC anodes with an ether-based electrolyte. Systematical investigation reveals that good compatibility of the electrode-electrolyte systems forms thinner but a more sustainable solid-electrolyte interphase and delivers a higher ionic conductivity and Na+ ion diffusion coefficient than the commonly used ester-based electrolytes. Therefore, an excellent electrochemical performance is demonstrated with a long cycle life (∼196 mA h/g and 90% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 1 A/g), a super rate capability (∼51% capacity retention at 10 A/g) at a mass loading of 1.5 mg/cm2, and a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 85.9%. More importantly, a high reversible areal capacity of 4.3 mA h/cm2 can be achieved at an ultrahigh mass loading of 17 mg/cm2, superior to all reported HC anodes. Our findings not only shed light on the design of high-performance battery systems but also promise a commercial transformation from the lab test to mass production of NIBs.",

        "abstract": "Metal thiophosphite has demonstrated promising application potential as an anode material for sodium‐ion batteries. Nevertheless, the intrinsic low electrical conductivity and drastic volume expansion impede its commercialization. Herein, a series of metal thiophosphite/Ti3C2Tx (metal = Fe, Ni, Co, and Cd) composites are constructed via Lewis acidic molten salt etching followed by synchronous phospho‐sulfurization. The Ti3C2Tx substrate endows the thiophosphite/Ti3C2Tx hybrids with high electrical conductivity. Importantly, thiophosphite grown on the MXene layers exhibits a 3D cross‐linked structure, which not only facilitates electron/ion transport, but also maintains robust structural stability owing to the space confinement effect. As a proof of concept, FePS3/Ti3C2Tx demonstrates remarkable rate performance (827.4 and 598.1 mAh g−1 at 0.1 and 10 A g−1, respectively) along with long‐term cycling stability (capacity retention of 93.7% after 2000 cycles at 5 A g−1). Impressively, the FePS3/Ti3C2Tx//NVPO full cell exhibits a high reversible capacity of 396.8 mAh g−1 over 1350 cycles at 2 A g−1. The sodium storage mechanism of FePS3/Ti3C2Tx anode is further unveiled through in situ XRD/ex situ HRTEM characterizations and theoretical calculations.

However, as a low‐melt metal, the preparation of PSn at room temperature is a difficult problem. Herein, universal chemical prelithiation/presodiation strategies are reported to rapidly synthesize PSn from commercial Sn powders at ambient temperature. The recyclable pre‐metallation solvents are selected by redox potential analysis to react with Sn to form alloy precursors in a short time. Benefiting from the application of delithiation/desodiation agents with suitable proton concentrations, PSn perfectly inherits the Sn skeleton from precursors. With this method, porous Al, Pb, Bi, and Sb are successfully produced. Finally, the half‐cell with PSn anode prepared by presodiation strategy achieves a great rate property (663 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1) and prominent cycling performance with 71% capacity retention after 7500 cycles (502 mAh g−1) at 5 A g−1.

A Coulombic efficiency of ≈99% is achieved after the third cycle. Increase of the C-rate leads to a drop of the capacity, but a full recovery is observed after switching back to the initial C-rate. In the early stages of Na uptake first Cu+ is reduced and expelled from the electrode as nanocrystalline metallic Cu. An increase of the Na content leads to a full conversion of the material with nanocrystalline Cu particles and elemental V embedded in a Na2S matrix. The formation of Na2S is evidenced by 23Na MAS NMR spectra and X-ray powder diffraction. During the charge process the nanocrystalline Cu particles are retained, but no crystalline materials are formed. At later stages of cycling the reaction mechanism changes which is accompanied by the formation of copper(I) sulfide. The presence of nanocrystalline metallic Cu and/or Cu2S improves the electrical conductivity, leading to superior cycling and rate capability.",

Here, sulfur-doped carbonized bacterial cellulose (S-CBC) was prepared as a high-performance anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) by simultaneous carbonization and sulfidation using the bacterial cellulose membrane produced by microbial fermentation as the precursor. Doping sublimed sulfur powder into CBC results in a greater degree of disorder and defects, buffering the volume expansion during the cycle. Significantly, the three-dimensional (3D) network structure of bacterial cellulose endows S-CBC with flexible self-support. As an anode for sodium ion batteries, S-CBC exhibits a high specific capacity of 302.9 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 50 cycles and 177.6 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1 after 1000 cycles. Compared with the CBC electrode, the S-CBC electrode also exhibits enhanced rate performance in sodium storage. Moreover, theoretical simulations reveal that Na+ has good adsorption stability and a faster diffusion rate in S-CBC. The doping of the S element introduces defects that enlarge the interlayer distance, and the synergies of adsorption and bonding are the main reasons for its high performance. These results indicate the potential application prospects of S-CBC as a flexible binder-free electrode for high-performance SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfides and oxides with high theoretical capacities have been regarded as promising anode candidates for a sodium-ion battery (SIB); however, they have critical issues including sluggish electrochemical kinetics and poor long-term stability. Herein, a dual carbon design strategy is proposed to integrate with highly active heterojunctions to overcome the above issues. In this new design, CoS2/CoO hollow dodecahedron heterojunctions are sandwiched between open framework carbon-spheres (OFCs) and a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanomembrane (OFC@CoS2/CoO@rGO). The CoS2/CoO heterojunctions effectively promote electron transfer on their surface and provide more electrochemical active sites through their hierarchical hollow structures assembled by nanodots. Meanwhile, the dual-carbon framework forms a highly conductive network that enables a better rate capability. More importantly, the dual carbon can greatly buffer volume expansion and stable reaction interfaces of electrode material during the charge/discharge process. Benefitting from their synergistical effects, the OFC@CoS2/CoO@rGO electrode achieves a high reversible capacity of 460 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 and still maintains 205.3 mAh g-1 even when current density is increased by 200 times when used as an anode material for SIBs. Their cycling property is also remarkable with a maintained capacity of 161 mAh g-1 after 3500 charging/discharging cycles at a high current density of 1 A g-1.

The highly reversible conversion of M/Na2S to pristine MS in charge plays a vital role with regard to the electrochemical performance. Here, taking conventional MoS2 as an example, guided by theoretical simulations, a catalyst of iron single atoms on nitrogen‐doped graphene (SAFe@NG) is selected and first used as a substrate to facilitate the reaction kinetics of MoS2 in the discharging process. In the following charging process, using a combination of spectroscopy and microscopy, it is demonstrated that the SAFe@NG catalyst enables an efficient reversible conversion reaction of Mo/Na2S→NaMoS2→MoS2. Moreover, theoretical simulations reveal that the reversible conversion mechanism shows favorable formation energy barrier and reaction kinetics, in which SAFe@NG with the Fe–N4 coordination center facilitates the uniform dispersion of Na2S/Mo and the decomposition of Na2S and NaMoS2. Therefore, efficient reversible conversion reaction MoS2↔NaMoS2↔Mo/Na2S is enabled by the SAFe@NG catalyst.

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfides (TMSs) have been extensively studied as electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries by virtue of their high theoretical capacity. However, the poor cyclability limits the practical application of TMSs in sodium ion batteries. In this study, N-rich carbon-coated Co3S4 ultrafine nanocrystal (Co3S4@NC) was prepared by utilizing ZIF-67 as a precursor through continuous carbonization and sulfuration processes, exhibiting ultrafine nanocrystals with a diameter of about 5 nm. When utilized as the anode for sodium ion batteries, the nanohybrid material exhibits remarkable cycling performance with a high specific capacity of 420.9 mA h g-1 at the current density of 100 mA g-1 after 100 cycles, indicating that the cycling performance is strengthened by the nitrogen-doped carbon coating. Impressively, the obtained material shows good rate performances with reversible specific capacities of 386.7, 284.0, and 151.2 mA h g-1 at 400, 1000, and 1400 mA g-1, respectively, due to the high surface-capacitance contribution and porous structure inherited from the precursor, which finally results in the increase in infiltration of electrolyte and the accelerating diffusion rate of Na+. This study sheds light on the routes to improve the performance of TMSs@nitrogen-doped carbon nanohybrid materials for sodium ion batteries.",

        "title": "N-doped carbon-coated ultrasmall Nb2O5 nanocomposite with excellent long cyclability for sodium storage.",
        "abstract": "Niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5) has drawn significant interest as a promising anode for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) due to its large interplanar lattice spacing and relatively high diffusion efficiency. However, the intrinsic drawbacks of low electrical conductivity and substantial volume change greatly impede its practical applications in large-scale energy storage systems. In this work, ultrasmall Nb2O5 nanoparticles wrapped with nitrogen-doped carbon (denoted as Nb2O5@NC) were delicately synthesized via a facile sol-gel method and subsequent heat treatment. The unique structure of ultrasmall Nb2O5 nanoparticles in a carbonaceous matrix can not only effectively shorten the transmission distance for both ions/electrons but also relieve the strain and stress caused by volume variation during the sodiation/desodiation process. In addition, the synergistic effect of nitrogen doping and carbon coating can further improve the electronic conductivity and pseudocapacitive behavior of the active materials, thus promoting the rapid electrochemical reaction kinetics of the Nb2O5@NC composite. The obtained 600-Nb2O5@NC-2 anode exhibits superior rate capability and outstanding cycling stability, delivering a reversible capacity of 196 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 1000 cycles. Even at high current densities of 5 A g-1 and 10 A g-1, the long-life cycling tests show that the reversible capacities still remain at 128.4 mA h g-1 and 95.9 mA h g-1 after 3000 cycles, respectively, which is the best performance of Nb2O5-based anodes at high current densities so far. These results indicate that the feasible synthetic strategy of Nb2O5@NC is an effective approach to develop high-performance Nb2O5-based anodes for large-scale energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are widely considered a hopeful alternative to lithium‐ion battery technology. However, they still face challenges, such as low rate capability, unsatisfactory cycling stability, and inferior variable‐temperature performance. In this study, a hierarchical Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) @reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/carbon nanotube (CNT) composite (NVPF@rGO/CNT) is successfully constructed. This composite features 0D Na3V2(PO4)2F3 nanoparticles are coated by a cross‐linked 3D conductive network composed of 2D rGO and 1D CNT. Furthermore, the intrinsic Na+ storage mechanism of NVPF@rGO/CNT through comprehensive characterizations is unveiled. The synthesized NVPF@rGO/CNT exhibits fast ionic/electronic transport and excellent structural stability within wide working temperatures (−40–50 °C), owing to the zero‐strain NVPF and the coated rGO/CNT conductive network that reduces diffusion distance for ions and electrons. Moreover, the stable integration between NVPF and rGO/CNT enables outstanding structural stability to alleviate strain and stress induced during the cycle. Additionally, a practice full cell is assembled employing a hard carbon anode paired with an NVPF@rGO/CNT cathode, which provides a decent capacity of 105.2 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C, thereby attaining an ideal energy density of 242.7 Wh kg−1.

Here, fabrication and characterization of high gravimetric and volumetric capacity 3D Ni-supported Sb2 O3 anodes for SIBs are presented. The electrodes are prepared by colloidal templating and pulsed electrodeposition followed by heat treatment. The colloidal template is optimized to provide large pore interconnects in the 3D scaffold to enable a high active materials loading and accommodate a large volume expansion during cycling. An electrodeposited loading of 1.1 g cm-3 is chosen to enable a combined high gravimetric and volumetric capacity. At this loading, the electrodes exhibit a specific capacity of ≈445 mA h g-1 and a volumetric capacity of ≈488 mA h cm-3 with a capacity retention of 89% after 200 cycles at 200 mA g-1 . The stable cycling performance can be attributed to the 3D metal scaffold, which supports active materials undergoing large volume changes, and an initial heat treatment appears to improve the adhesion of the Sb2 O3 to the metal scaffold.",

        "abstract": "It is still very urgent and challenging to simultaneously develop high‐rate and long‐cycle oxide cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) because of the sluggish kinetics and complex multiphase evolution during cycling. Here, the concept of accurately manipulating structural evolution and formulating high‐performance heterostructured biphasic layered oxide cathodes by local chemistry and orbital hybridization modulation is reported. The P2‐structure stoichiometric composition of the cathode material shows a layered P2‐ and O3‐type heterostructure that is explicitly evidenced by various macroscale and atomic‐scale techniques. Surprisingly, the heterostructured cathode displays excellent rate performance, remarkable cycling stability (capacity retention of 82.16% after 600 cycles at 2 C), and outstanding compatibility with hard carbon anode because of the integrated advantages of intergrowth structure and local environment regulation. Meanwhile, the formation process from precursors during calcination and the highly reversible dynamic structural evolution during the Na+ intercalation/deintercalation process are clearly articulated by a series of in situ characterization techniques. Also, the intrinsic structural properties and corresponding electrochemical behavior are further elucidated by the density of states and electron localization function of density functional theory calculations. Overall, this strategy, which finely tunes the local chemistry and orbitals hybridization for high‐performance SIBs, will open up a new field for other materials.",

        "abstract": "It is of fundamental and technological significance to develop dual‐role anode materials for both lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) with high performance. Here, a composite material based on CoSe2 nanoparticles encapsulated in N‐doped carbon framework intertwined with carbon nanotubes (CoSe2@N‐CF/CNTs) is prepared successfully from cobalt‐based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF‐67). As anode materials for LIBs, CoSe2@N‐CF/CNTs composites deliver a reversible capacity of 428 mAh g−1 even after 500 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1 with almost 100% Coulombic efficiency. The charge and discharge mechanisms of CoSe2 are characterized using ex situ X‐ray diffraction and Raman analysis, from which the lithiation products of CoSe2 are found to be LixCoSe2 and Li2Se, which are further converted to CoSe2 upon delithiation. The CoSe2@N‐CF/CNTs composites also demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance as anode materials for SIBs with a carbonate‐based electrolyte, with specific capacities of 606 and 501 mAh g−1 at 0.1 and 1 A g−1 in the 100th cycle. The electrochemical performance of the anode materials is further studied by pseudocapacitance and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurements.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the ultra-wide spacing MoS2/C structure is beneficial for the chemical adsorption of sodium ions and facilitates redox reactions.

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) possess the potential to realize low-cost and large-scale energy storage due to the abundance of sodium. However, the large ionic radius of sodium often leads to sluggish kinetics and large volume change, limiting the further development of SIBs. Layered MoS2, with a large interlayer distance, is a promising intercalation anode material for SIBs. In this work, we report the synthesis of methyl-functionalized MoS2 (M-MoS2) nanosheets through a facile second solvothermal method. During the second solvothermal treatment, the pristine MoS2 is mostly converted from the 2H to 1T phase and the interlayer distance is expanded from 0.65 to 0.80 nm. When evaluated as the anode for SIBs, the M-MoS2 exhibits superior cycling stability and rate capability. Kinetic analysis shows that the capacity is mainly contributed from a pseudocapacitive process. Ex situ XRD shows that the M-MoS2 exhibits inhibited lattice breathing and thus reduced volume change during cycling. This work demonstrates that the M-MoS2 is a promising candidate for pseudocapacitive sodium storage.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal chalcogenides have received great attention as promising anode candidates for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the undesirable cyclic life and inferior rate capability still restrict their practical applications. The design of micro-nano hierarchitectures is considered as a possible strategy to facilitate the electrochemical reaction kinetics and strengthen the electrode structure stability upon repeated Na+ insertion/extraction. Herein, urchin-like Fe3 Se4 hierarchitectures are successfully prepared and developed as a novel anode material for SIBs. Impressively, the as-prepared urchin-like Fe3 Se4 can present an ultrahigh rate capacity of 200.2 mAh g-1 at 30 A g-1 and a prominent capacity retention of 99.9% over 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1 , meanwhile, a respectable initial coulombic efficiency of ≈100% is achieved. Through the conjunct study of in situ X-ray diffraction, ex situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy, as well as cyclic voltammetry curves, it is intriguing to reveal that the phase transformation from monoclinic to amorphous structure accompanied by the pseudocapacitive Na+ storage behavior accounts for the superior electrochemical performance. When paired with the Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 cathode materials, the assembled full cell enables high energy density and decent cyclic stability, demonstrating potential practical feasibility of the present urchin-like Fe3 Se4 anode.",

        "abstract": "2D transition metal carbides and nitrides, named MXenes, are attracting increasing attentions and showing competitive performance in energy storage devices including electrochemical capacitors, lithium‐ and sodium‐ion batteries, and lithium–sulfur batteries. However, similar to other 2D materials, MXene nanosheets are inclined to stack together, limiting the device performance. In order to fully utilize MXenes' electrochemical energy storage capability, here, processing of 2D MXene flakes into hollow spheres and 3D architectures via a template method is reported. The MXene hollow spheres are stable and can be easily dispersed in solvents such as water and ethanol, demonstrating their potential applications in environmental and biomedical fields as well. The 3D macroporous MXene films are free‐standing, flexible, and highly conductive due to good contacts between spheres and metallic conductivity of MXenes. When used as anodes for sodium‐ion storage, these 3D MXene films exhibit much improved performances compared to multilayer MXenes and MXene/carbon nanotube hybrid architectures in terms of capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability. This work demonstrates the importance of MXene electrode architecture on the electrochemical performance and can guide future work on designing high‐performance MXene‐based materials for energy storage, catalysis, environmental, and biomedical applications.",

        "abstract": "Developing non‐graphitic carbons with unique microstructure is a popular strategy to enhance the significant potential in practical applications of sodium‐ion batteries (SIB), while the electrochemical performance imbalances arising from their intricate active surface and porous structure pose significant challenges to its commercialization. Inspired by the structure of biological cell membranes, N/P co‐doped hard carbon nanospheres (NPCS) anodes with abundant ultramicropores (≈0.6 nm) are proposed and synthesized as robust sodium anodes. Based on density functional theory calculations, optimizing ultramicropores can enable small Na+ to be well confined within the pores and hinder large solvent molecules from invading and reacting, introducing N/P species contributes to the rapid adsorption/diffusion of Na+. In situ XRD and Raman analysis suggest that the nanoconfinement strategy induced by abundant ultramicropores and N/P co‐doping enables highly reversible electrochemical reactions. Electrochemical test confirms that the nanoconfinement strategy endows the NPCS anode with high reversible capacity (376.3 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1), superior initial coulombic efficiency (87.3% at 1.0 A g−1), remarkable rate capability (155.6 mAh g−1 at 50.0 A g−1) and excellent cycling stability (with capacity retention of ≈94.6% after 10 000 cycles), lightening a promising avenue for developing SIB with robust durability.",

        "abstract": "Exploring a sodium-enriched cathode (i.e. Na4V2(PO4)3, which differs from its traditional stoichiometric counterpart Na3V2(PO4)3 that can provide extra endogenous sodium reserves to mitigate the irreversible capacity loss of the anode material (i.e. hard carbon), is an intriguing presodiation method for the development of high energy sodium-ion batteries. To meet this challenge, herein, we first propose a redox-potential-matched chemical sodiation approach, utilizing phenazine-sodium (PNZ-Na) as the optimal reagent to sodiate the Na3V2(PO4)3 precursor into Na-enriched Na4V2(PO4)3. The spontaneous sodiation reaction enables a fast reduction of one-half V ions from V3+ to V2+, followed by the insertion of one Na+ ion into the NASICON framework, which only takes 90 s to obtain the phase-pure Na4V2(PO4)3 product. When paired with a hard carbon anode, the resulting Na4VP‖HC full cell exhibits a high energy density of 251 W h kg−1, which is 58% higher than that of 159 W h kg−1 for the Na3VP‖HC control cell. Our chemical sodiation methodology provides an innovative approach for designing sodium-rich cathode materials and could serve as an impetus to the development of advanced sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Carbon materials with large capacity and low potential serve as promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Carbon defects offer active sites for sodium storage but sacrifice reversibility, whereas carbon microcrystals improve conductivity but may suffer from low capacity. Herein, the balance between defects and microcrystals is realized by the molecular chemistry method of cross-linking and defect repairing. Real-time spectroscopic analyses reveal that the decomposition of tetrabromophthalic anhydride (TBPA) molecule induces the dehydrogenation of pitch to release small gas molecules to form pseudo-closed pores, followed by the cross-linking of C═O bonds in TBPA with the dehydrogenated pitch to form C─O─C bonds and thus suppress the excessive microcrystal growth. Meanwhile, the decomposition products of TBPA can also react with the dehydrogenated pitch to repair carbon defects. Thanks to the microstructure balance, the as-synthesized carbon material exhibits a smoother ion mass transfer channel (d(002) = 0.386 nm, La = 4.56 nm) and a larger storage space (Vpseudo-closed pore = 0.086 cm3 g-1) than the pitch carbon (PC, d(002) = 0.349 nm, La = 5.90 nm, Vpseudo-closed pore = 0.041 cm3 g-1), increasing the capacity from 162.5 to 336.5 mAh g-1.

Herein, we have developed a general one-pot strategy for the synthesis of transition-metal phosphide (TMP) based hybrid nanosheets composed of carbon-coated TMP nanoparticles anchored to the surface of nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets. This facile and cost-effective method is quite universal and holds potential to be further extended to other metal phosphide materials. Significantly, the hybrid nanosheet electrode possesses excellent sodium storage properties as anodes for SIBs, including high specific capacity, an ultra-long cycle life and a remarkable rate performance. This work makes a significant contribution to not only the synthetic methodology of TMP-carbon two-dimensional hybrid nanostructures, but also the application of TMP-based anodes for high-energy SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Two new structural forms of Na xCo0.5Ti0.5O2, the layered O3- and P3-forms, were synthesized and comprehensively characterized. Both materials show electrochemical activity as electrodes in Na-ion batteries. During cell charging (desodiation of the Na xCo0.5Ti0.5O2 cathode), we observed a structural phase transformation of O3-Na0.95Co0.5Ti0.5O2 into P3-Na xCo0.5Ti0.5O2, whereas no changes other than conventional unit cell volume shrinkage were detected for P3-Na0.65Co0.5Ti0.5O2. During Na insertion (cell discharging), the reconversion of the P3-form into O3-Na xCo0.5Ti0.5O2 was impeded for both materials and occurs well below 1 V versus Na+/Na only. The reconversion is hindered by the charge and spin transfers of Co (LS-Co3+ → HS-Co2+) and by a significant unit cell volume expansion at the P3 → O3 transformation, as revealed from the magnetization, crystallographic, and spectroscopic studies. As the kinetics of such transformations depend on numerous parameters such as time, temperature, and particle size, a large cell overpotential ensues. An extended cutoff voltage at 0.2 V versus Na+/Na during discharging allows to complete the P3 → O3 transformation and increases the specific discharging capacity to 200 mA h g-1. Moreover, a quasi-symmetrical full cell, based on the O3- and P3-forms, was designed, eliminating safety concerns associated with sodium anodes and delivering a discharge capacity of 130 mA h g-1.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal phosphides have been extensively investigated owing to their high theoretical capacities and relatively low intercalation potentials vs Li/Li+, but their practical applications have been hindered by low electrical conductivity and dramatic volume variation during cycling. In this work, an interesting strategy for the rational design of graphene (GR) encapsulated with a hollow FeP@carbon nanocomposite (H-FeP@C@GR) via a combination of a hydrothermal route, a carbon-coating process, phosphidation treatment, and carbothermic reaction is reported. The hollow FeP (H-FeP) nanospheres shelled with thin carbon layers are wonderfully incorporated into the GR matrix, interconnecting to form a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical architecture. Such a design offers distinct advantages for FeP-based anode materials for both lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium ion batteries (SIBs). For example, the 3D omnibearing conductive networks from the GR skeleton and outer coating carbon can provide an open freeway for electron/ion transport, promoting the electrode reaction kinetics. In addition, the wrapping of an H-FeP nanosphere in a thin carbon layer enables the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the carbon layer surface instead of on the individual H-FeP surface, preventing the continual re-forming of the SEI. When used as anode materials for LIBs and SIBs, H-FeP@C@GR exhibited excellent electrochemistry performances.",

However, kinetic mismatches between fast capacitive charge storage on the cathode and sluggish battery-type reactions on the anode lead to a poor charge/discharge rate capability and insufficient power output of Na-ion capacitors. Thus, developing suitable anode materials for Na-ion capacitors is urgently desirable. This work demonstrates an electrochemically exfoliated graphite (EEG) anode with enhanced capacitive charge storage, greatly boosting the Na-ion reaction kinetics of co-intercalation. The EEG anode shows a high reversible capacity of 109 mAh g-1 and maintains a good capacity retention of 90% after 1000 cycles. The assembled Na-ion capacitor using the EEG anode can finish the charge/discharge process in less than 10 s, which achieves an ultrahigh power density of 17,500 W kg-1 with an energy density of 17 Wh kg-1. The high capacitive contributions at both the anode and cathode contribute to the fast rate capability and high power output of the fabricated Na-ion capacitors.

        "abstract": "In comparison with lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been proposed as an alternative for large-scale energy storage. However, finding an anode material that can overcome the sluggish electrochemical reaction kinetics and fast capacity fading caused by large volume expansion during cycling is problematic. In this study, the intercalation technique for nitrogen-doped carbon layers is implemented for the molybdenum disulfide (MoS2/NC) structure to improve the rate and cycling stability of SIBs by increasing the diffusion rate of sodium ions and mitigating excessive volume structural expansion. The as-synthesized MoS2/NC anode has a high discharge specific capacity of 546 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 160 cycles, as well as a high rate and stable cycle performance of 406 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1 after 1000 cycles. Upon coupling with a high-voltage Na3V2(PO4)2O2F cathode, the sodium-ion full battery displays high specific energies of 78.57 W h kg-1 and 49.70 W h kg-1 at specific powers of 193.76 W kg-1 and 3756.80 W kg-1, respectively, with commercialization potential demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "The sodium ions battery (SIBs) has the potential to be the next generation rechargeable system that utilizes cheap and abundant sodium material. One of the key obstacles to sodium batteries is the lack of efficient and stable anode materials. Compared with traditional inorganic electrode materials, organic materials are more attractive because of their easier sodium transport accessibility and the diversities of organic frameworks and functional groups. In this work, two molecules (Na-CPN and Na-CPP) were synthesized and used as anode materials for SIBs. Structurally, the two compounds are isomers, and they are distinguished by the position of N atoms in phenylpyridine. Na-CPP provides a high reversible capacity of 197 mAh g -1 , excitingly, its capacity could maintain 99.1% even after 350 cycles of 100 mA g -1 . Moreover, after going through 1200 cycles at a current density of 5C, the Na-CPP electrode still retain a capacity rate of 89.9%. These results are impressive. In contrast, Na-CPN exhibited inferior capacity performance and rate performance for its larger polarization, particle size and charge transporting resistance.",

Oxygen vacancies and nitrogen-doped carbon coating were introduced simultaneously by the calcination of core-shell structured TiO2 spheres in a reducing atmosphere. Compared to the anatase TiO2 with and without oxygen vacancies, TiO2-x@NC exhibits much better electrochemical performance in the storage of sodium ions. A high reversible capacity of 245.6 mA h g-1 is maintained at 0.1 A g-1 after 200 cycles, and a high specific capacity of 155.6 mA h g-1 is achieved at a high rate of 5.0 A g-1. The significantly improved electrochemical performance of the core-shell structured anatase TiO2 spheres is attributed to the synergistic effect of the oxygen vacancies in the anatase lattice and surface nitrogen-doped carbon coating.

        "abstract": "Interface stability is a key to practical applications of high‐rate sodium metal batteries (SMBs). The general sodium metal anode (SMA), for example, suffers from an unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI), which may induce severe dendrite growth and continuous Na consumption, particularly under high rates. At the same time, the cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) of a widely adopted cathode material Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) has to tolerate the massive volume changes during the rapid Na+ ion intercalation/extraction, resulting in structural degradations and the capacity loss. Here, a facile strategy is reported by introducing aluminum ethoxide to a conventional ether‐based electrolyte, to promote the formation of an alumina‐rich SEI and CEI, which facilitates the rapid Na+ ion transport across the interface and promotes the uniform Na deposition. The resultant Na || Na symmetric cell demonstrates a stable cycling of 4800 h at 10 mA cm−2 and 1 mAh cm−2, and a Na || NVP full cell exhibits a high capacity retention of 81.28% after 6000 cycles at 40C. The simultaneous interface engineering of both the Na metal anode and the NVP cathode via the facile organic aluminum additive opens up a new avenue toward practical application of high‐rate SMBs.",

However, attaining long‐term stability and high‐capacity performance of SIBs at ultrahigh rates remains a significant challenge due to the large ionic radius and slow kinetic behavior of Na+. Herein, a novel robust anode with a dual‐biomimetic gradient hierarchical architecture is proposed and provide a simple strategy to fabricate this sulfur‐doped mesoporous carbon concave hollow sphere/Ti3C2Tx MXene (SCMX) anode. In addition, Cu2S nanoparticles are in situ embedded into the SCMX architecture by electrochemical induction during the cycling process to act as active sites, which enhances the rate performance and cycling stability. Relying on its hybrid architecture and in situ formed Cu2S, this SCMX anode can achieve high ion accessibility, rich active sites, rapid charge transfer, and favorable structure stability, as disclosed by in/ex situ characterizations. As a result, it exhibits high reversible capacity (745.6 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1), ultrahigh‐rate capability (380.5 mAh g−1 at 50.0 A g−1), and long cycling stability (98.2% capacity retention after 10 000 cycles at 80.0 A g−1).

Accordingly, after the regulation of closed pore structure, the reversible capacity increased from 207 to 330 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1, realizing an increase of ≈130 mAh g-1 in the plateau region and the initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) is enhanced from 78% to 90%. When applied in full cell with O3-Na[Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3]O2, it showed an energy density of 247 Wh kg-1.

Nevertheless, it is a big challenge to prepare main group element with high loading content. Here, multifield‐regulated synthesis (MRS) technology is utilized to rapidly produce single‐atom antimony (Sb) metal with a high loading of 15 wt.%. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal the significantly enhanced reaction kinetics of Sb and nitrogen‐doped graphene by multi‐physics field coupling. Compared with common metallic Sb nanoparticles, atomically dispersed Sb displays remarkably improved electrochemical reaction kinetics and stable structure due to the negligible variation of stresses and volume expansion during the pseudocapacitive alloying‐dealloying process. Such extraordinary alloying reaction in well‐dispersed Sb atoms enabling homogeneous ion flow can serve as active nucleation sites for regulating even Na metal nucleation and growth. As a result, copper foil coated with only ≈3 µm thickness of such material exhibits a high Coulombic efficiency of up to 99.99%, an ultra‐low overpotential of 3 mV, and a long lifetime exceeding 2500 h in symmetrical cells. Furthermore, an anode‐free MRS‐SbSA||Na3V2(PO4)3 battery is constructed, which demonstrates exceptionally high energy density (≈362 Wh Kg−1), outstanding rate capability and good cycling stability.",

        "abstract": "Developing sodium ion battery (SIB) anode materials of a low-cost and high-capacity nature for future large-scale applications still involves challenges. Herein, we have reported gallium sulfide (Ga2S3) as a novel SIB anode material for the first time. Ga2S3 nanorods have been synthesized via the facile hydrothermal preparation of a GaOOH precursor with subsequent H2S annealing. Mixed with graphene upon electrode preparation, this Ga2S3 electrode maintains a reversible specific capacity of 476 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.4 A g-1, with a coulombic efficiency of over 99%. Ex situ XRD analysis and theoretical calculations are employed to comprehensively elucidate the detailed sodium ion storage mechanism of Ga2S3, which is composed of initial Na+ intercalation, a subsequent multi-step conversion reaction between S and Na+, and an eventual alloying reaction between Ga and Na+ with the end product of Na7Ga13. Further kinetics analysis has demonstrated that the conversion reaction is the rate-limiting step due to a multi-step reaction with the intermediate phase of GaS. Moreover, the appearance of liquid metal Ga, as confirmed via TEM observations and theoretical calculations, can serve as a self-healing agent that repairs cracks in the electrode. Our findings shed light on the further design of Ga-based materials, and they also can be extended to solid-state-battery systems.",

The all‐around encapsulation (plane‐to‐plane contact) architecture that provides a large interface between N‐graphene and SnSb nanocrystal not only effectively enhances the electron conductivity and structural integrity of the overall electrode, but also offers excess interfacial sodium storage, thus leading to much enhanced high‐rate sodium storage capacity and stability, which has been proven by both experimental results and first‐principles simulations.

Herein, sodium diphenyl ketone (Na-DK) is applied to realize dual-function presodiation for HC anodes. It compensates the irreversible Na uptake at the oxygen-containing functional groups and reacts with carbon defects of five/seven-membered rings for quasi-metallic sodium in HC. The as-formed sodium induces robust NaF-rich SEI on HC in 1.0 M NaPF6 in diglyme, favoring the interfacial reaction kinetics and stable Na+ insertion and extraction. This renders the presodiated HC (pHC) with high ICE of ~100% and capacity retention of 82.4% after 6800 cycles. It is demonstrated to couple with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathodes in full cells to show high capacity retention of ~100% after 700 cycles.

However, it still remains a challenge to obtain a high‐performance hard carbon anode from cost‐effective carbon sources. In addition, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is subjected to continuous rupture during battery cycling, leading to fast capacity decay. Herein, a lignin‐based hard carbon with robust SEI is developed to address these issues, effectively killing two birds with one stone. An innovative gas‐phase removal‐assisted aqueous washing strategy is developed to remove excessive sodium in the precursor to upcycle industrial lignin into high‐value hard carbon, which demonstrated an ultrahigh sodium storage capacity of 359 mAh g−1. It is found that the residual sodium components from lignin on hard carbon act as active sites that controllably regulate the composition and morphology of SEI and guide homogeneous SEI growth by a near‐shore aggregation mechanism to form thin, dense, and organic‐rich SEI. Benefiting from these merits, the as‐developed SEI shows fast Na+ transfer at the interphases and enhanced structural stability, thus preventing SEI rupture and reformation, and ultimately leading to a comprehensive improvement in sodium storage performance.",

However, the inevitable side reactions between Na metal anode and electrolyte, the formation of Na dendrite during cycling, and the uneven electric field distribution at the interface will lead to a decrease in the cycling stability of the battery. Herein, N and S co‐doped carbon dots are employed as electrolyte additives in view of their quantum size, excellent dispersion, and polar surface functional groups. It is found that the quantum‐sized carbon core and sodiophilic surface functional groups of N,S‐CDs enable the homogenous deposition of Na+ and the involvement of N,S‐CDs in the formation of solid electrolyte film. The N,S‐CDs co‐deposition guarantees the uniform sodium plating in the initial cycle, avoiding the routine dendrite growth.

        "title": "A Multifunctional Interphase Layer Enabling Superior Sodium‐Metal Batteries under Ambient Temperature and −40 °C",
        "abstract": "The sodium (Na)‐metal anode with high theoretical capacity and low cost is promising for construction of high‐energy‐density metal batteries. However, the unsatisfactory interface between Na and the liquid electrolyte induces tardy ion transfer kinetics and dendritic Na growth, especially at ultralow temperature (−40 °C). Herein, an artificial heterogeneous interphase consisting of disodium selenide (Na2Se) and metal vanadium (V) is produced on the surface of Na (Na@Na2Se/V) via an in situ spontaneous chemical reaction. Such interphase layer possesses high sodiophilicity, excellent ionic conductivity, and high Young's modulus, which can promote Na‐ion adsorption and transport, realizing homogenous Na deposition without dendrites. The symmetric Na@Na2Se/V cell exhibits outstanding cycling life span of over 1790 h (0.5 mA cm−2/1 mAh cm−2) in carbonate‐based electrolyte. More remarkably, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the artificial Na2Se/V hybrid interphase can accelerate the desolvation of solvated Na+ at −40 °C. The Na@Na2Se/V electrode thus exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance in symmetric cell (over 1500 h at 0.5 mA cm−2/0.5 mAh cm−2) and full cell (over 700 cycles at 0.5 C) at −40 °C. This work provides an avenue to design artificial heterogeneous interphase layers for superior high‐energy‐density metal batteries at ambient and ultralow temperatures.",

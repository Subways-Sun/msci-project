        "abstract": "Rational construction of nanosized anode nanomaterials is crucial to enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium-/sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs). Various anode nanoparticles are created mainly via templating surface confinement, or encapsulation within precursors (such as metal-organic frameworks). Herein, low-content SnO2 nanodots on N-doped reduced graphene oxide (SnO2@N-rGO) were prepared as anode nanomaterials for LIBs and SIBs, via a distinctive lattice confinement of a CoAlSn-layered double hydroxide (CoAlSn-LDH) precursor. The SnO2@N-rGO composite exhibits the advantagous features of low-content (17.9 wt%) and uniform SnO2 nanodots (3.0 ± 0.5 nm) resulting from the lattice confinement of the Co and Al species to the surrounded Sn within the same crystalline layer, and high-content conductive rGO. The SnO2@N-rGO composite delivers a highly reversible capacity of 1146.2 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 for LIBs, and 387 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 for SIBs, outperforming N-rGO. Furthermore, the dominant capacitive contribution and the rapid electronic and ionic transfer, as well as small volume variation, all give rise to the enhancement. Precursor-based lattice confinement could thus be an effective strategy for designing and preparing uniform nanodots as anode nanomaterials for electrochemical energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Metallic selenides have been widely investigated as promising electrode materials for metal-ion batteries based on their relatively high theoretical capacity. However, rapid capacity decay and structural collapse resulting from the larger-sized Na+ /K+ greatly hamper their application. Herein, a bimetallic selenide (MoSe2 /CoSe2 ) encapsulated in nitrogen, sulfur-codoped hollow carbon nanospheres interconnected reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (rGO@MCSe) are successfully designed as advanced anode materials for Na/K-ion batteries. As expected, the significant pseudocapacitive charge storage behavior substantially contributes to superior rate capability. Specifically, it achieves a high reversible specific capacity of 311 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 in NIBs and 310 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 in KIBs. A combination of ex situ X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy tests reveals the phase transition of rGO@MCSe in NIBs/KIBs. Unexpectedly, they show quite different Na+ /K+ insertion/extraction reaction mechanisms for both cells, maybe due to more sluggish K+ diffusion kinetics than that of Na+ . More significantly, it shows excellent energy storage properties in Na/K-ion full cells when coupled with Na3 V2 (PO4 )2 O2 F and PTCDA@450 °C cathodes. This work offers an advanced electrode construction guidance for the development of high-performance energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "Sluggish reaction kinetics induced by the inferior solid-state ion diffusion and poor conductivity of electrode materials currently conflict with increasing fast-charge needs for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) based on conversion mechanism. Herein, mesoporous, conductive, thin-wall three-dimension (3D) skeletons of molybdenum nitride (meso-Mo2N) were established and employed as anodes to facilitate rate performance for SIBs. Mesoporous channels (～9.3 nm) with very thin walls (＜8 nm) and conductive networks in meso-Mo2N enable the rapid Na+/Li+ infiltrability/diffusivity and smooth electron transfer, respectively. The fast ion diffusion/transfer ability is confirmed by galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, cyclic voltammetry tests with higher ion-diffusion dominated capacity and larger Na+ diffusion coefficient. Consequently, meso-Mo2N exhibited a superior rate capability and a stable specific capacity of 158 mAh g-1 (after 1000 cycles) at 1 A g-1 for SIBs, surpassing nonporous Mo2N and even the previously reported Mo2N. Furthermore, the proof of concept can be also extended to enhanced Li storage. Such mesostructured design with 3D mesoporous, conductive thin wall of electrodes is a promising strategy for achieving fast-charging and high-performance Na/Li storage.",

Herein, porous Bi@C (P-Bi@C) microspheres consisting of self-assembled Bi nanosheets and carbon shells were constructed via a hydrothermal method combined with a carbothermic reduction. The optimized P-Bi@C-700 (annealed at 700 °C) demonstrates 359.8 mAh g-1 after 1500 cycles at 1 A g-1. In situ/ex situ characterization and density functional theory calculations verified that this P-Bi@C-700 relieves the volume expansion, facilitates Na+/electron transport, and possesses an alloying-type storage mechanism. Notably, P-Bi@C-700 also achieved 360.8 and 370.3 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 under 0 and 60 °C conditions, respectively. Na3V2(PO4)3//P-Bi@C-700 exhibits a capacity of 359.7 mAh g-1 after 260 cycles at 1 A g-1.

        "abstract": "Hard carbons (HCs), while a leading candidate for sodium-ion battery (SIB) anode materials, face challenges in their unfavorable sodiation kinetics since the intricate microstructure of HCs complicates the Na+ diffusion channel. Herein, a Hovenia dulcis-derived HC realizes a markedly enhanced high-rate performance in virtue of dual-functionalized Ca. The interlayer doped Ca2+ effectively enlarges the interlayer spacing, while the in situ-formed CaSe templates induce the formation of hierarchical pore structures and intrinsic defects, significantly providing fast Na+ diffusion channels and abundant active sites and thus enhancing the sodium storage kinetics. Achieved by the synergistic effect of regulation of intrinsic microcrystalline and pore structures, the optimized HC shows remarkable performance enhancements, including a high reversible capacity of 350.3 mA h g-1 after 50 cycles at 50 mA g-1, a high-capacity retention rate of 95.3% after 1000 cycles, and excellent rate performance (108.4 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1).

        "abstract": "Metallic phase 1T‐MoS2 is considered a prospective anode material for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) due to its remarkable electrical conductivity and unique layered structure. However, 1T‐MoS2 is thermodynamically unstable and prone to phase transition to the 2H‐MoS2 phase. Herein, self‐supporting nitrogen‐doped and carbon‐coated 1T/2H mixed‐phase MoS2 nanosheets with rich sulfur vacancies on carbon cloth (C@N‐MoS2‐p/CC) are synthesized through a hydrothermal method and Ar/NH3 radio‐frequency (RF) plasma treatment process. Density‐functional‐theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that after Ar/NH3 RF plasma treatment, nitrogen‐doping and etching effects are realized, which combine with carbon‐coating significantly reduce the phase transition energy of 1T‐MoS2, thus triggering the phase transition and enabling the stable existence of the highly active 1T‐MoS2. As a result, the C@N‐MoS2‐p/CC exhibits outstanding sodium storage performance, with initial charge–discharge capacities of 701.0/797.0 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1, respectively. It also demonstrates exceptional rate capabilities and ultra‐high cyclic stability, maintaining a discharge capacity of 404.2 mAh g−1 after 910 cycles at a high rate of 2 A g−1. In a full cell with Na3V2(PO4)3/CC cathode, it exhibits excellent initial charge–discharge capacities of 102.3/102.9 mAh g−1 and maintains satisfactory cycling stability after 350 cycles (86.7 mAh g−1) at 0.1 C.",

        "abstract": "Lignin-derived porous carbons have great potential for energy storage applications. However, their traditional synthesis requires highly corrosive activating agents in order to produce porous structures. In this work, an environmentally friendly and unique method has been developed for preparing lignin-based 3D spherical porous carbons (LSPCs). Dropwise injection of a lignin solution containing PVA sacrificial templates into liquid nitrogen produces tiny spheres that are lyophilized and carbonized to produce LSPCs. Most of the synthesized samples possess excellent specific surface areas (426.6–790.5 m2/g) along with hierarchical micro- and mesoporous morphologies. When tested in supercapacitor applications, LSPC-28 demonstrates a superior specific capacitance of 102.3 F/g at 0.5 A/g, excellent rate capability with 70.3% capacitance retention at 20 A/g, and a commendable energy density of 2.1 Wh/kg at 250 W/kg. These materials (LSPC-46) also show promising performance as an anode material in sodium-ion batteries with high reversible capacity (110 mAh g–1 at 100 mA g–1), high Coulombic efficiency, and excellent cycling stability. This novel and green technique is anticipated to facilitate the scalability of lignin-based porous carbons and open a range of research opportunities for energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "The binder's choice holds immense significance in the quest for robust electrochemical performances of lithium/sodium‐ion battery's (LIB/SIB) electrodes. Conventional PVDF binder is a passive polymer lacking the ability to transport Li+/Na+ and facilitate ion kinetics. This limitation poses constraints in achieving high specific capacity, fast charging, and long cycle life. Herein, a novel water‐soluble concentrated imidazolium functionalized poly(ionic liquid), poly(oxycarbonylmethylene 1‐allyl‐3‐methyimidazolium) (PMAI) is synthesized, and evaluated it as binder in LIB/SIB. PMAI‐based anodic‐half cell exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, achieving higher capacities (297 mAhg−1 at 1C for LIBs and 250 mAhg−1 at 60 mAg−1 for SIBs) and good cycle stability (80 % capacity retention after 750 cycles for LIBs; 96% capacity retention after 200 cycles for SIBs), compared to PVDF binder. In addition, PMAI/Gr delivers a higher discharge capacity of 85 mAhg−1 than PVDF/Gr with 47 mAhg−1 at 5C. PMAI‐containing electrodes show better rate capability at different current densities than PVDF binder in LIB/SIB. The enhanced ion diffusion coefficient, lower resistance and decreased activation energy of desolvation, are ascribed to densely polar ionic liquid groups along the polymer and formation of a functionalized SEI via binder reduction. The novel PMAI binder's design and full‐cell examination confirm its potential in secondary‐ion battery applications.",

Via such a unique design, porous and bare structures can thoroughly expose the electroactive surfaces to the electrolyte, which is favorable for ultrafast sodium‐ion storage. In addition, the CFC provides an interconnected 3D conductive network to ensure firm electrical connection of the electrode materials. Besides the inherent flexibility of the CFC, the integration of the hierarchical structures of CoxP with the CFC, as well as the strong synergistic effect between them, effectively help to buffer the mechanical stress caused by repeated sodiation/desodiation, thereby guaranteeing the structural integrity of the overall electrode. Consequently, CoxP@CFC as an anode shows a record‐high capacity of 279 mAh g−1 at 5.0 A g−1 with almost no capacity attenuation after 9000 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Featuring a high theoretical capacity, low cost, and abundant resources, sodium metal has emerged as an ideal anode material for sodium ion batteries. However, the real feasibility of sodium metal anodes is still hampered by the uncontrolled sodium dendrite problems. Herein, an artificial three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical porous sodiophilic V2CTx/rGO-CNT microgrid aerogel is fabricated by a direct-ink writing 3D printing technology and further adopted as the matrix of Na metal to deliver a Na@V2CTx/rGO-CNT sodium metal anode. Upon cycling, the V2CTx/rGO-CNT electrode can yield a superior cycling life of more than 3000 h (2 mA cm-2, 10 mAh cm-2) with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.54%. More attractively, it can even sustain a stable operation over 900 h at 5 mA cm-2 with an ultrahigh areal capacity of 50 mAh cm-2. In situ and ex situ characterizations and density functional theory simulation analyses prove that V2CTx with abundant sodiophilic functional groups can effectively guide the sodium metal nucleation and uniform deposition, thus enabling a dendrite-free morphology. Moreover, a full cell pairing a Na@V2CTx/rGO-CNT anode with a Na3V2(PO4)3@C-rGO cathode can deliver a high reversible capacity of 86.27 mAh g-1 after 400 cycles at 100 mA g-1.

        "abstract": "The shortage of high-capacity anode materials with long cycling stability is the main roadblock to the development of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The advantages of transition metal selenides are high theoretical capacity, safety and ease of design, which gradually make them potential substitute materials for the anodes of a new generation of SIBs. However, the low intrinsic conductivity of transition metal selenides and the serious powderization during charge and discharge processes restrict their rate performance and cycling stability in SIBs. Herein, bimetallic selenide ZnSe/MoSe2@NC is fabricated by in situ selenation of a rhombic dodecahedron structured metal-organic framework (MOF) containing Zn/Mo salt. Such a heterojunction and structural regulation effectively promote sodium ion transportation. Furthermore, the porous and hierarchical ZnSe/MoSe2@NC is capable of adapting to the volume stress generated by sodium ion (de)insertion. Specifically, in SIB half-cell measurement, a comparable capacity of 401.8 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 1 A g-1 can be achieved by ZnSe/MoSe2@NC. Additionally, the ZnSe/MoSe2@NC polyhedron delivers a high capacity of 345.7 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1 (1500 cycles). Electrochemical kinetics analysis is performed in detail. In SIB full battery applications, the cell shows an impressive energy density of 175.1 W h kg-1. This research broadens the development prospect of transition metal selenides as anodes in SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The significance of exploring optimal electrode materials cannot be overstated, particularly in mitigating the critical issues posed by sluggish redox kinetics, significant volume variations, and severe structural collapse resulting from the insertion and extraction of sodium ions. These efforts are crucial for enhancing the longevity and rapid charging capabilities of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a defect engineering strategy for the in situ encapsulation of single‐phase ternary iron phosphoselenide into porous carbon by robust chemical bonds with the formation of rod‐like multicavity nanohybrids (FePSe3@C) is presented. The incorporation of Se atom not only modulates the electronic structure of the central metal Fe atom and enhances the intrinsic electrical conductivity, but also generates numerous additional reaction sites and accelerates the reaction kinetics of FePSe3@C, as corroborated by theoretical calculations and kinetic analysis. Notably, the FePSe3@C demonstrates an outstanding rate capability of 321.7 mAh g−1 even at 20 A g−1 and long cycling stability over 1000 cycles. The sodium‐ion full cell, pairing the FePSe3@C anode with the Na3V2(PO4)3@C cathode, exhibits a remarkable energy density of 202 Wh kg−1, demonstrating its practical applicability. This work provides a controllable defect and morphology engineering strategy to construct advanced materials with fast charge transfer for high‐power/energy SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium metal has become one of the most promising anodes for next‐generation cheap and high‐energy‐density metal batteries; however, challenges caused by the uncontrollable sodium dendrite growth and fragile solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) restrict their large‐scale practical applications in low‐cost and wide‐voltage‐window carbonate electrolytes. Herein, a novel multifunctional separator with lightweight and high thinness is proposed, assembled by the cobalt‐based metal–organic framework nanowires (Co‐NWS), to replace the widely applied thick and heavy glass fiber separator. Benefitting from its abundant sodiophilic functional groups and densely stacked nanowires, Co‐NWS not only exhibits outstanding electrolyte wettability and effectively induces uniform Na+ ion flux as a strong ion redistributor but also favors constructing the robust N,F‐rich SEI layer. Satisfactorily, with 10 µL carbonate electrolyte, a Na|Co‐NWS|Cu half‐cell delivers stable cycling (over 260 cycles) with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 98%, and the symmetric cell shows a long cycle life of more than 500 h. Remarkably, the full cell shows a long‐term life span (over 1500 cycles with 92% capacity retention) at high current density in the carbonate electrolyte. This work opens up a strategy for developing dendrite‐free, low‐cost, and long‐life‐span sodium metal batteries in carbonate‐based electrolytes.",

In this work, N-modified carbon-coated sodium titanium phosphate (NTPGN) composites were prepared by the sol-gel method by using sodium glutamate as a source of nitrogen and partial carbons. The addition of sodium glutamate forms a loose structure of nano-spherical flowers on the surface of sodium titanium phosphate, which shows a higher specific capacity, better rate performance, and excellent cycling performance compared to the carbon-coated titanium phosphate derived only from citric acid.

        "abstract": "Heterostructure construction with mixed transition metal sulfides has been recognized as a promising strategy to boost the performance of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a carbon-decorated MoS2/CoS heterostructure on carbon cloth (MoS2/CoS@CC) as a free-standing anode for SIBs was synthesized via a facile growth-carbonization strategy. In the composite, the generated built-in electric field at MoS2 and CoS heterointerfaces is beneficial for elevating the electron conductivity, thus expediting the Na-ion transport rate. Moreover, different redox potentials between MoS2 and CoS can effectively mitigate the mechanical strain induced by repeated Na+ de-/intercalation, thus ensuring the structural integrity. In addition, the carbon skeleton derived from the carbonization of glucose can enhance the conductivity of the electrode and maintain the structural integrity. Consequently, the resulting MoS2/CoS@CC electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 605 mA h g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 after 100 cycles, and prominent rate performance (366 mA h g-1 at 8.0 A g-1). Theoretical calculations also confirm that the establishment of a MoS2/CoS heterojunction can powerfully promote the electron conductivity, thereby enhancing the Na-ion diffusion kinetics.",

It has been demonstrated that for HC anodes improved electrochemical performance, e.g., increase in coulombic efficiency (CE) and improved rate performance have been achieved in ether‐based electrolytes. Here, we investigate spray‐coated HC composite electrodes charged at low and high current rates in 1 M sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) in diglyme using half‐cell experiments.

In 1 M NaPF6 ether‐based electrolyte, the spray‐coated HC composite electrodes reached a discharge capacity of 431 mA h g−1 at 0.1C that stays constant for 40 cycles, which is substantially higher than that obtained in carbonate‐based electrolytes. We investigated the formed interphase using scanning (electrochemical) probe microscopy (S(E)PM), X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time‐of‐flight secondary‐ion mass spectrometry (ToF‐SIMS), revealing distinct differences for longer cycling and at varying current rates which indicates that the properties of the formed SEI layers are influenced by the formation conditions.",

        "abstract": "We report an effective approach of utilizing multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as an active anode material in sodium ion batteries by expanding the interlayer distance in a few outer layers of multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The performance enhancement was investigated using a density functional tight binding (DFTB) molecular dynamics simulation. It is found that a sodium atom forms a stable bonding with the partially expanded MWCNT (PECNT) with the binding energy of -1.50 eV based on the density functional theory calculation with van der Waals correction, where a sodium atom is caged between the two carbon hexagons in the two consecutive MWCNTs. Wave function and charge density analyses show that this binding is physisorption in nature. This larger exothermic nature of binding energy favors the stable bonding between the PECNT and a sodium atom, and thereby, it helps to enhance the electrochemical performance. In the experimental works, partial opening of the MWCNT with the expanded interlayer has been designed by the well-known Hummer's method. It has been found that the introduction of functional groups causes a partial opening of the outer few layers of a MWCNT, with the inner core remaining undisturbed. The enhanced performance is due to an expanded interlayer of carbon nanotubes, which provide sufficient active sites for the sodium ions to adsorb as well as to intercalate into the carbon structure. The PECNT shows a high specific capacity of 510 mAh g-1 at a current density of 20 mA g-1, which is about 2.3 times the specific capacity obtained for a pristine MWCNT at the same current density. This specific capacity is higher when compared to other carbon-based materials. The PECNT also shows a satisfactory cyclic stability at a current density of 200 mA g-1 for 100 cycles. Based on our experimental and theoretical results, an alternative perspective for the storage of sodium ions in MWCNTs is proposed.",

        "abstract": "Electrochemical conversion reactions of metal oxides provide a new avenue to build high capacity anodes for sodium-ion batteries. However, the poor rate performance and cyclability of these conversion anodes remain a significant challenge for Na-ion battery applications because most of the conversion anodes suffer from sluggish kinetics and irreversible structural change during cycles. In this paper, we report an Fe2O3 single crystallites/reduced graphene oxide composite (Fe2O3/rGO), where the Fe2O3 single crystallites with a particle size of ∼300 nm were uniformly anchored on the rGO nanosheets, which provide a highly conductive framework to facilitate electron transport and a flexible matrix to buffer the volume change of the material during cycling. This Fe2O3/rGO composite anode shows a very high reversible capacity of 610 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1, a high Coulombic efficiency of 71% at the first cycle, and a strong cyclability with 82% capacity retention after 100 cycles, suggesting a potential feasibility for sodium-ion batteries. More significantly, the present work clearly illustrates that an electrochemical conversion anode can be made with high capacity utilization, strong rate capability, and stable cyclability through appropriately tailoring the lattice structure, particle size, and electronic conduction channels for a simple transition-metal oxide, thus offering abundant selections for development of low-cost and high-performance Na-storage electrodes.",

However, transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) anodes show unsatisfactory Na+ electrochemical performance owing to the low intrinsic conductivity and inferior ion transport kinetics. Here, an elaborate design is developed to prepare a composite of WSSe nanosheets supported on a 3D cross-networked porous carbon skeleton (WSSe@CPCS), which possesses en-rich anion vacancies and WSSe with expanded inter-layer spacing, as well as an interconnected porous structure. As a result, the WSSe@CPCS anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) exhibits preeminent reversible capacities, excellent cycle stability, and superior rate capability. The systematic electrochemical kinetic analysis and density functional theory results further show that the effect of anion vacancies and CPCS synergistically enhances the conductivity and reduces charge transfer resistance, thus making a great contribution to fast reaction kinetics. Finally, the implementations of the WSSe@CPCS anode in progressive SIB and DIB full-cell configurations exhibit satisfactory performance, which reveals their widely practical application. This research will provide an exciting approach to designing advanced defect-structured tungsten-based TMD materials for SIBs, DIBs, and even a broad range of energy storage.",

However, searching for suitable anode materials with high-rate and stable cycling performance is still needed to promote their practical application. Herein, three-dimensional Na2Ti3O7 nanowire arrays with enriched surface vacancies endowed by phosphorus doping are reported. When evaluated as anodes for sodium-ion batteries, the electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 290 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C, good rate capability (50 mAh g-1 at 20 C), and stable cycling capability (98% capacity retention over 3100 cycles at 20 C). The superior electrochemical performance is attributed to the synergistic effects of the unique nanowire arrays and phosphorus doping. The rational structures can provide convenient channels to facilitate ions/electrons transport and improve the capacitive contributions. Moreover, the phosphorus-doping-induced surface vacancies not only provide more active sites but also improve the intrinsic electrical conductivity of Na2Ti3O7, which will enable the electrode materials with excellent sodium storage performance. This work may provide an effective strategy for the synthesis of other anode materials with fast electrochemical reaction kinetics and good sodium storage performance.",

        "abstract": "Room-temperature Na ion batteries (NIBs) have attracted great attention because of the widely available, abundant sodium resources and potentially low cost. Currently, the challenge of the NIB development is due primarily to the lack of a high-performance anode, while the Na metal anode holds great promise considering its highest specific capacity of 1165 mA h/g and lowest anodic potential. However, an uneven deposit, relatively infinite volume change, and dendritic growth upon plating/stripping cycles cause a low Coulombic efficiency, poor cycling performance, and severe safety concerns. Here, a stable Na carbonized wood (Na-wood) composite anode was fabricated via a rapid melt infusion (about 5 s) into channels of carbonized wood by capillary action. The channels function as a high-surface-area, conductive, mechanically stable skeleton, which lowers the effective current density, ensures a uniform Na nucleation, and restricts the volume change over cycles. As a result, the Na-wood composite anode exhibited flat plating/stripping profiles with smaller overpotentials and stable cycling performance over 500 h at 1.0 mA/cm2 in a common carbonate electrolyte system. In sharp comparison, the planar Na metal electrode showed a much shorter cycle life of 100 h under the same test conditions.",

However, their viability is severely hampered by dendrite‐related hazards on anodes. Herein, a novel ultrathin (8 µm) exterior‐nonporous separator composed of honeycomb‐structured fibers is prepared for homogeneous Na deposition and suppressed dendrite penetration. The unhindered ion transmission greatly benefits from honeycomb‐structured fibers with huge electrolyte uptake (376.7%) and the polymer's inherent transport ability. Additionally, polar polymer chains consisting of polyethersulfone and polyvinylidene customize the highly aggregated solvation structure of electrolytes via substantial solvent immobilization, facilitating ion‐conductivity‐enhanced inorganic‐rich solid‐electrolyte interphase with remarkable interface endurance. With the reliable mechanical strength of the separator, the assembled sodium‐ion full cell delivers significantly improved energy density and high safety, enabling stable operation under cutting and rolling. The as‐prepared separator can further be generalized to lithium‐based batteries for which apparent dendrite inhibition and cyclability are accessible and demonstrates its potential for practical application.",

        "abstract": "Developing hard carbon with a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and very good cycling stability is of great importance for practical sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Defects and oxygen-containing groups grown along either the carbon edges or the layers, however, are inevitable in hard carbon and can cause a tremendous density of irreversible Na+ sites, decreasing the efficiency and therefore causing failure of the battery. Thus, eliminating these unexpected defect structures is significant for enhancing the battery performance. Herein, we develop a strategy of applying a soft-carbon coating onto free-standing hard-carbon electrodes, which greatly hinders the formation of defects and oxygen-containing groups on hard carbon. The electrochemical results show that the soft-carbon-coated, free-standing hard-carbon electrodes can achieve an ultrahigh ICE of 94.1% and long cycling performance (99% capacity retention after 100 cycles at a current density of 20 mA g-1), demonstrating their great potential in practical sodium storage systems. The sodium storage mechanism was also investigated by operando Raman spectroscopy. Our sodium storage mechanism extends the \"adsorption-intercalation-pore filling-deposition\" model. We propose that the pore filling in the plateau area might be divided into two parts: (1) sodium could fill in the pores near the inner wall of the carbon layer; (2) when the sodium in the inner wall pores is close to saturation, the sodium could be further deposited onto the existing sodium.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been extensively studied owing to the abundance and low-price of Na resources. However, the infeasibility of graphite and silicon electrodes in sodium-ion storage makes it urgent to develop high-performance anode materials. Herein, α-MnSe nanorods derived from δ-MnO2 (δ-α-MnSe) are constructed as anodes for SIBs. It is verified that α-MnSe will be transferred into β-MnSe after the initial Na-ion insertion/extraction, and δ-α-MnSe undergoes typical conversion mechanism using a Mn-ion for charge compensation in the subsequent charge-discharge process. First-principles calculations support that Na-ion migration in defect-free α-MnSe can drive the lattice distortion to phase transition (alpha → beta) in thermodynamics and dynamics. The formed β-MnSe with robust lattice structure and small Na-ion diffusion barrier boosts great structure stability and electrochemical kinetics. Hence, the δ-α-MnSe electrode contributes excellent rate capability and superior cyclic stability with long lifespan over 1000 cycles and low decay rate of 0.0267% per cycle. Na-ion full batteries with a high energy density of 281.2 Wh·kg-1 and outstanding cyclability demonstrate the applicability of δ-α-MnSe anode.",

        "abstract": "There are only a handful of reports on indium sulfide (In2S3) in the electrochemical energy storage field without a clear electrochemical reaction mechanism. In this work, a simple electrospinning method has been used to synthesize In2S3/C nanofibers for the first time. In lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the In2S3/C nanofiber electrode can not only deliver a high initial reversible specific capacity of 696.4 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1, but also shows ultra-long cycle life with a capacity retention of 80.5% after 600 cycles at 1000 mA g-1. In sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), the In2S3/C nanofibers electrode can exhibit a high initial reversible specific capacity (393.7 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1) and excellent cycling performance with a high capacity retention of 97.3% after 300 cycles at 1000 mA g-1. The excellent electrochemical properties mainly benefited from In2S3 being encapsulated by a carbon matrix, which buffers the volume expansion and significantly improves the conductivity of the composite. Furthermore, the structural evolution of In2S3 during the first lithiation/delithiation and sodiation/desodiation processes has been illustrated by ex situ XRD. The results confirm that the reaction mechanism of In2S3 in both LIBs and SIBs can be summarized as conversion reactions and alloying reactions, which provide theoretical support for the development of In2S3 in the field of electrochemistry.",

        "abstract": "Owing to several advantages of metallic sodium (Na), such as a relatively high theoretical capacity, low redox potential, wide availability, and low cost, Na metal batteries are being extensively studied, which are expected to play a major role in the fields of electric vehicles and grid-scale energy storage. Although considerable efforts have been devoted to utilizing MXene-based materials for suppressing Na dendrites, achieving a stable cycling of Na metal anodes remains extremely challenging due to, for example, the low Coulombic efficiency (CE) caused by the severe side reactions. Herein, a g-C3N4 layer was attached in situ on the Ti3C2 MXene surface, inducing a surface state reconstruction and thus forming a stable hetero-interphase with excellent sodiophilicity between the MXene and g-C3N4 to inhibit side reactions and guide uniform Na ion flux. The 3D construction can not only lower the local current density to facilitate uniform Na plating/stripping but also mitigate volume change to stabilize the electrolyte/electrode interphase. Thus, the 3D Ti3C2 MXene@g-C3N4 nanocomposite enables much enhanced average CEs (99.9% at 1 mA h cm-2, 0.5 mA cm-2) in asymmetric half cells, long-term stability (up to 700 h) for symmetric cells, and stable cycling (up to 800 cycles at 2 C), together with outstanding rate capability (up to 20 C), of full cells.

Alloy-type anode materials for sodium-ion batteries are esteemed as prospective candidate materials for sodium-ion anodes, owing to their elevated theoretical capacity, heightened utilization efficiency, and minimal production of insulating byproducts. However, the severe volume changes and sluggish ion diffusion kinetics can lead to irreversible particle fragmentation and reaggregation phenomena, ultimately resulting in electrode degradation. Additionally, repetitive volume changes can cause an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). This study presents the synthesis of chloride-ion-modulated bimetallic SnSb/C nanoparticle anode materials, highlighting the following advantages: (i) Designing a bimetallic SnSb alloy structure serves to buffer the structural stresses generated during sodium insertion/extraction processes, effectively mitigating particle fracture phenomena induced by electrode material expansion/contraction. (ii) Nanostructuring both alloy materials enables the full utilization of active materials and shortens diffusion pathways, thereby significantly enhancing the diffusion rate of sodium ions. (iii) Introducing a carbonaceous matrix serves to alleviate self-agglomeration phenomena of the material during charge/discharge cycles, enhancing the material's conductivity and structural stability.

When evaluated as an anode for lithium-ion batteries, the Fe2 O3 @C@MoS2 /CFC electrode manifests an outstanding electrochemical performance with a high discharge capacity of 1541.2 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and a good capacity retention of 80.1% at 1.0 A g-1 after 500 cycles. As for sodium-ion batteries, it retains a high reversible capacity of 889.4 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 over 200 cycles. The superior electrochemical performance mainly results from the unique 3D ordered Fe2 O3 @C@MoS2 array-type nanostructures and the synergistic effect between the C@MoS2 nanosheet arrays and Fe2 O3 nanoparticles. The Fe2 O3 nanoparticles act as spacers to steady the structure, and the graphite carbon could be incorporated into MoS2 nanosheets to improve the conductivity of the whole electrode and strengthen the integration of MoS2 nanosheets and CFC by the adhesive role, together ensuring high conductivity and mechanical stability.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries offer an attractive option for grid-level energy storage due to the high natural abundance of sodium and low material cost of sodium compounds. Phosphorus (P) is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries, with a theoretical capacity of 2596 mAh/g. The red phosphorus (RP) form has worse electronic conductivity and lower initial Coulombic efficiency than black phosphorus (BP), but high material cost and limited production capacity have slowed the development of BP anodes. To address these challenges, we have developed a simple and scalable method to synthesize layered BP/graphene composite (BP/rGO) by pressurization at room temperature. A carbon-black-free and binder-free BP/rGO anode prepared with this method achieved specific charge capacities of 1460.1, 1401.2, 1377.6, 1339.7, 1277.8, 1123.78, and 720.8 mAh/g in a rate capability test at charge and discharge current densities of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, and 40 A/g, respectively. In a cycling performance test, after 500 deep cycles, the capacity of BP/rGO anodes stabilized at 1250 and 640 mAh/g at 1 and 40 A/g, respectively, which marks a significant performance improvement for sodium-ion battery anodes.",

However, they usually exhibit inferior thermodynamic stability and sluggish Na+ kinetics due to the unwanted phase transitions and large Na+-ionic radius. In this work, considering the beneficial synergistic effects of layered P2/P3 and Fd3[combining macron]m spinel phases, a stable layered/spinel intergrowth nanocomposite Na0.5[Ni0.2Co0.15Mn0.65]O2 is rationally designed and successfully prepared via a co-precipitation route and a subsequent solid-state reaction, and the triphase synergy in this layered/spinel nanocomposite is demonstrated. In Na/Na0.5[Ni0.2Co0.15Mn0.65]O2 half-cells, it delivers a high specific capacity of ∼180 mA h g-1 and a good cycling stability, with a capacity retention of 87.6% after 100 cycles, at a rate of 0.1C between 1.5 and 4.0 V (vs. Na/Na+). The large reversible capacity of 105 mA h g-1 is also achieved even at a high rate of 10C, indicating high-rate capability. Besides, the full-cells using this nanocomposite as the cathode and hard carbon as the anode exhibit long-term cycle-life and high-power properties, indicating the expected merits of layered/spinel mixed phases. The superior sodium storage performance of this layered P3/P2 and spinel intergrowth nanocomposite makes it a promising candidate as a long-life and high-rate cathode for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Electrochemical ion storage behaviors of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, as a representative transition metal oxide for an environmentally benign and low-cost anode for a sodium-ion battery, are thoroughly investigated through a combination of electrochemical analysis and diagnostics of Fe3O4 electrode cells, X-ray-based and spectroscopic analysis of material structure evolution as functions of depth of discharge (DoD) and state of charge (SoC), and first principle modeling. The gravimetric capacity is found to be 50 mA h/g for bulk Fe3O4 (50 nm average crystallite size) and 100 mA h/g─about a tenth of the theoretical prediction for complete conversion─for Fe3O4 nanoparticles (8.7 nm average particle size), respectively. A fundamental and mechanistic study of material evolution as functions of DoD and SoC shows that Fe3O4 does not allow electrochemical incorporation of Na+ ions into the empty cation positions of the inverse spinel structure, leading to our assertion that electrochemical intercalation of Na+ ions to conversion of the Fe3O4 anode in sodium-ion batteries is nonviable. A density functional theory investigation points to the impracticality of the intercalation of Na+ ions into Fe3O4 and further validates our experimental findings. We propose several possible mechanisms corresponding to the observed low capacity, including formation of solid electrolyte interphases with unfavorable properties and adsorption of Na+ ions onto surfaces of nanoparticles and/or at heterointerfaces in Fe3O4 composite electrodes in a NaPF6-based electrolyte system.",

However, its development is hampered by the limited metallic utilization and detrimental sodium dendrite growth ascribed to the unstable, and fragile solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Here, the high stable and modulus SEI is constructed with a component of a thin and dense layer of high Na‐ion conductive Na2SiO3. It is in situ formed by the reaction between sodium anode and fish‐skin structure separator, which exhibits a 3D porous polyvinylidene fluoride‐based framework embedded with thin and robust vermiculite sheets. The robust interphase cannot only suppress sodium dendrite growth but also enable high energy density with small interphase‐consumed Na ions in anode‐less batteries. Accordingly, the as‐assembled NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2//Na cell shows 83% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at a rate of 5 °C. Moreover, the proof‐of‐concept pouch cells deliver an energy density of 205 Wh kg−1 (based on the total mass of the battery), and high safety (not catching fire after punctured) under anode‐less condition (with a low negative/positive capacity ratio of ≈2.1).",

Here, a dual-carbon conductive network enhanced GeP5 (GeP5/acetylene black/partially reduced graphene oxide sheets (GeP5/AB/p-rGO)) composite is successfully prepared by a facile ball milling method. The dual-carbon network not only provides more transport pathways for electrons but also relaxes the huge volume change of the electrode material during the charge/discharge process. Compared with only AB- or GO-modified GeP5 (GeP5/AB or GeP5/GO) composite, the GeP5/AB/p-rGO composite shows a superior sodium storage performance with an excellent rate and cycle performance. It delivers a high reversible capacity of 597.5 and 175 mAh/g at the current density of 0.1 and 5.0 A/g, respectively. Furthermore, at the current density of 0.5 A/g, the GeP5/AB/p-rGO composite shows the reversible capacity of 400 mAh/g after 50 cycles with a little capacity attenuation.

Herein, with the assistance of a simple calcination method and common raw materials, the environmentally friendly and nontoxic N‐doped C@Zn3B2O6 composite is directly synthesized and proved to be a potential anode material for NIBs. The composite demonstrates a high reversible charge capacity of 446.2 mAh g−1 and a safe and suitable average voltage of 0.69 V, together with application potential in full cells (discharge capacity of 98.4 mAh g−1 and long cycle performance of 300 cycles at 1000 mA g−1). In addition, the sodium‐ion storage mechanism of N‐doped C@Zn3B2O6 is subsequently studied through air‐insulated ex situ characterizations of X‐ray diffraction (XRD), X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier‐transform infrared (FT‐IR) spectroscopy, and is found to be rather different from previous reports on borate anode materials for NIBs and lithium‐ion batteries. The reaction mechanism is deduced and proposed as: Zn3B2O6 + 6Na+ + 6e− ⇋ 3Zn + B2O3 ∙ 3Na2O, which indicates that the generated boracic phase is electrochemically active and participates in the later discharge/charge progress.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfide‐based anodes usually suffer from huge volumetric change and sluggish reaction kinetics, hindering their application for long‐term and high‐power/energy sodium‐ion batteries. Herein, a new design of CoS2‐xSex (0≤x≤2) nanocrystals with highly controllable selenium substitution and S, Se‐codoped graphene immobilization (CoS2‐xSex@SG) is proposed to tune the reaction kinetics and structural stability. The nanocrystal‐on‐graphene structure and robust C─S &C─Se bonding rivets between CoS2‐xSex and SG greatly improve the structural stability of the CoS2‐xSex@SG. Electrochemical performance, kinetic analysis, and theoretical calculation reveal that Se substitution plays a double‐edged role in sodium storage: the increase of Se substitution content enhances the Na+ diffusion kinetics but decreases the Na‐storage capacity. When the Se substitution content is 0.4, the CoS1.6Se0.4@SG electrode demonstrates the best performance: high initial Coulombic efficiency (95.5%), ultrahigh rate capability (412.8 mAh g−1 at 30 A g−1), and ultra‐stable cycling performance (97.6% capacity retention after 1000 cycles). In situ/ex situ measurements further unveil that the conversion reaction between Co0 and Na2S/Na2Se generates the micro‐scaled CoSe2–CoS2 heterostructure, synergistically improving the Na‐storage active sites and reaction kinetics.

        "abstract": "Metal sulfides are gaining prominence as conversion anode materials for lithium/sodium ion batteries due to their higher specific capacities but suffers from low stability and reversibility issues. In this work, the electrochemical properties of CuS anode material has been successfully enhanced by its composite formation using graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4). The CuS nanoparticles are distributed evenly in the exfoliated g-C3N4 matrix rendering higher electronic conductivity and space for volume alterations during the repeated discharge/charge cycles. The 0.8CuS:0.2g-C3N4 composite when used as an anode for lithium ion coin cell exhibits a reversible capacity of 478.4 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 2.0 A g−1 after a run of 1000 cycles which is better than that reported for CuS composites with any other carbon-based matrix. The performance is equally impressive when 0.8CuS:0.2g-C3N4 composite is used as an anode in a sodium ion coin cell and a reversible capacity of 408 mA h g−1 is obtained at a current rate of 2.0 A g−1 after a run of 800 cycles. A sodium ion full cell with NVP cathode and 0.8CuS:0.2g-C3N4 composite anode has been fabricated and cycled for 100 runs at a current rate of 0.1 A g−1. It can be inferred that the g-C3N4 matrix improves the ion transfer properties, alleviates the volume alteration happening in the anode during the discharge/charge process and also helps in preventing the leaching of polysulfides generated during the electrochemical process.",

        "abstract": "Alloying-type antimony (Sb) with high theoretical capacity is a promising anode candidate for both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Given the larger radius of Na+ (1.02 Å) than Li+ (0.76 Å), it was generally believed that the Sb anode would experience even worse capacity degradation in SIBs due to more substantial volumetric variations during cycling when compared to LIBs. However, the Sb anode in SIBs unexpectedly exhibited both better electrochemical and structural stability than in LIBs, and the mechanistic reasons that underlie this performance discrepancy remain undiscovered. Here, using substantial in situ transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman techniques complemented by theoretical simulations, we explicitly reveal that compared to lithiation/delithiation process, sodiation/desodiation process of Sb anode displays a previously unexplored two-stage alloying/dealloying mechanism with polycrystalline and amorphous phases as the intermediates featuring improved resilience to mechanical damage, contributing to superior cycling stability in SIBs. Additionally, the better mechanical properties and weaker atomic interaction of Na-Sb alloys than Li-Sb alloys favor enabling mitigated mechanical stress, accounting for enhanced structural stability as unveiled by theoretical simulations. Our finding delineates the mechanistic origins of enhanced cycling stability of Sb anode in SIBs with potential implications for other large-volume-change electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "Carbon-encapsulated Sn@N-doped carbon tubes with submicron diameters were obtained via the simple reduction of C@SnO2@N-doped carbon composites that were fabricated by a hydrothermal approach. Sn nanoparticles encapsulated in carbon layers were distributed uniformly on the surfaces of the N-doped carbon nanotubes. The electrochemical performances of the composites were systematically investigated as anode materials in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The composite electrode could attain a good reversible capacity of 398.4 mAh g-1 when discharging at 100 mA g-1, with capacity retention of 67.3% and very high Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% over 150 cycles. This good cycling performance, when compared to only 17.5 mAh g-1 delivered by bare Sn particles prepared via the same method without the presence of N-doped carbon, could be mainly ascribed to the uniform distribution of the precursor SnO2 on the substrate of N-doped carbon tubes with three-dimensional structure, which provides more reaction sites to reduce the diffusion distance of Na+, further facilitating Na+-ion diffusion and relieves the huge volume expansion during charging/discharging. These outcomes imply that such a Sn/C composite would provide more options as an anode candidate for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as the ideal candidates for the next generation of electrochemical energy storage devices. The major challenges of anode lie in poor cycling stability and the sluggish kinetics attributed to the inherent large Na+ size. In this work, Bi nanosphere encapsulated in N‐doped carbon nanowires (Bi@N‐C) is assembled by facile electrospinning and carbonization. N‐doped carbon mitigates the structure stress/strain during alloying/dealloying, optimizes the ionic/electronic diffusion, and provides fast electron transfer and structural stability. Due to the excellent structure, Bi@N‐C shows excellent Na storage performance in SIBs in terms of good cycling stability and rate capacity in half cells and full cells. The fundamental mechanism of the outstanding electrochemical performance of Bi@N‐C has been demonstrated through synchrotron in‐situ XRD, atomic force microscopy, ex‐situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Importantly, a deeper understanding of the underlying reasons of the performance improvement is elucidated, which is vital for providing the theoretical basis for application of SIBs.",

Herein, a general and scalable solvent-exchange strategy is presented for uniform dispersion of few-layer MoS2 (f-MoS2 ) from high-boiling-point solvents (N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), N,N-dimethyl formaldehyde (DMF), etc.) into low-boiling-point solvents (water, ethanol, etc.). The solvent-exchange strategy dramatically simplifies high-yield production of dispersible MoS2 nanosheets as well as facilitates subsequent decoration of MoS2 for various applications. As a demonstration, MoS2 -decorated nitrogen-rich carbon spheres (MoS2 -NCS) are prepared via in situ growth of polypyrrole and subsequent pyrolysis. Benefiting from its ultrathin feature, largely exposed active surface, highly conductive framework and excellent structural integrity, the 2D core-shell architecture of MoS2 -NCS exhibits an outstanding reversible capacity and excellent cycling performance, achieving high initial discharge capacity of 1087.5 and 508.6 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 , capacity retentions of 95.6% and 94.2% after 500 and 250 charge/discharge cycles at 1 A g-1 , for lithium/sodium ion storages, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Autonomic self-healing (SH), namely, the ability to repair damages from mechanical stress spontaneously, is polarizing attention in the field of new-generation electrochemical devices. This property is highly attractive to enhance the durability of rechargeable Li-ion batteries (LIBs) or Na-ion batteries (SIBs), where high-performing anode active materials (silicon, phosphorus, etc.) are strongly affected by volume expansion and phase changes upon ion insertion. Here, we applied a SH strategy, based on the dynamic quadruple hydrogen bonding, to nanosized black phosphorus (BP) anodes for Na-ion cells. The goal is to overcome drastic capacity decay and short lifetime, resulting from mechanical damages induced by the volumetric expansion/contraction upon sodiation/desodiation. Specifically, we developed novel ureidopyrimidinone (UPy)-telechelic systems and related blends with poly(ethylene oxide) as novel and green binders alternative to the more conventional ones, such as polyacrylic acid and carboxymethylcellulose, which are typically used in SIBs. BP anodes show impressively improved (more than 6 times) capacity retention when employing the new SH polymeric blend. In particular, the SH electrode still works at a current density higher than 3.5 A g–1, whereas the standard BP electrode exhibits very poor performances already at current densities lower than 0.5 A g–1. This is the result of better adhesion, buffering properties, and spontaneous damage reparation.",

The optimized LSCa‐derived carbon delivers a high reversible capacity of 317 mA h g−1 at 30 mA g−1 with ~60% plateau capacity, and it retains a capacity of 170 mA h g−1 even at 3000 mA g−1. These achievements are ascribed to the larger d002 values, smaller defects, and more closed pores, compared with the original sample from the direct carbonization of LSCa.",

        "abstract": "Tin oxide (SnO) is considered one of the most promising metal oxides for utilization as anode material in sodium ion batteries (SIBs), because of its ease of synthesis, high specific gravimetric capacity, and satisfactory cycling performance. However, to aim at practical applications, the Coulombic efficiency during cycling needs to be further improved, which requires a deeper knowledge of its working mechanism. Here, a microflower-shaped SnO material is synthesized by means of an ultrafast ionic liquid-assisted microwave method. The as-prepared SnO anode active material exhibits excellent cycling performance, good Coulombic efficiency as well as a large capacity delivered at low potential, which is fundamental to maximize the energy output of SIBs. These overall merits were never reported before for pure SnO anodes (i.e., not in a composite with, for example, graphene). Additionally, by combining ex situ XRD and XPS, it is clearly demonstrated for the first time that the Sn-Na alloy, which is formed during the initial sodium sodiation, desodiates in two successive but fully separated steps. Totally different from the previous report, the pristine SnO phase is not regenerated upon desodiation up to 3 V vs Na/Na+. The newly disclosed reaction route provides an alternative view of the complex reaction mechanism of these families of metal oxides for sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Highly porous carbon materials with a rationally designed pore structure can be utilized as reservoirs for metal or nonmetal components. The use of small-sized metal or metal compound nanoparticles, completely encapsulated by carbon materials, has attracted significant attention as an effective approach to enhancing sodium ion storage properties. These materials have the ability to mitigate structural collapse caused by volume expansion during the charging process, enable short ion transport length, and prevent polysulfide elution. In this study, a concept of highly porous carbon-coated carbon nanotube (CNT) porous microspheres, which serve as excellent reservoir materials is suggested and a porous microsphere is developed by encapsulating iron sulfide nanocrystals within the highly porous carbon-coated CNTs using a sulfidation process. Furthermore, various sulfidation processes to determine the optimal method for achieving complete encapsulation are investigated by comparing the morphologies of diverse iron sulfide-carbon composites. The fully encapsulated structure, combined with the porous carbon, provides ample space to accommodate the significant volume changes during cycling. As a result, the porous iron sulfide-carbon-CNT composite microspheres exhibited outstanding cycling stability (293 mA h g-1 over 600 cycles at 1 A g-1 ) and remarkable rate capability (100 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1 ).",

        "abstract": "Abstract Amorphous carbon holds great promise as anode material for sodium‐ion batteries due to its cost‐effectiveness and good performance. However, its sodium storage mechanism, particularly the insertion process and origin of plateau capacity, remains controversial. Here, an extended adsorption/insertion‐filling sodium storage mechanism is proposed using petroleum coke‐derived amorphous carbon as a multi‐microcrystalline model. Combining in situ X‐ray diffraction, in situ Raman, theoretical calculations, and neutron scattering, the effective storage form and location of sodium ions in amorphous carbon are revealed. The sodium adsorption at defect sites leads to a high‐potential sloping capacity. The sodium insertion process occurs in both the pseudo‐graphite phase (d 002 > 0.370 nm) and graphite‐like phase (0.345 ≤ d 002 < 0.370 nm) rather than the graphite phase, contributing to low‐potential sloping capacity. The sodium filling into accessible closed pores forms quasi‐metallic sodium clusters, contributing to plateau capacity. The threshold of the effective interlayer spacing for sodium insertion is extended to 0.345 nm, breaking the consensus of insertion interlayer threshold and enhancing understanding of closed pore filling. The extended adsorption/insertion‐filling mechanism explains the sodium storage behavior of amorphous carbon with different microstructures, providing theoretical guidance for the rational design of high‐performance amorphous carbon anodes.",

Nevertheless, due to a lack of direct atomistic observation, the detailed understanding of fundamental intercalation behavior and Bi2S3's (de)sodiation mechanisms remains unclear. Here, by employing in situ high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy, consecutive electron diffraction coupled with theoretical calculations, it is not only for the first time identified that Bi2S3 exhibits specific ionic transport pathways preferred to diffuse along the (110) direction instead of the (200) plane, but also tracks their real‐time phase transformations (de)sodiation involving multi‐step crystallographic tuning.

        "title": "Highly Reversible Sodium Metal Battery Anodes via Alloying Heterointerfaces.",
        "abstract": "As a promising pathway toward low-cost, long-duration energy storage, rechargeable sodium batteries are of increasing interest. Batteries that incorporate metallic sodium as anode promise a high theoretical specific capacity of 1166 mAh g-1 , and low reduction potential of -2.71 V. The high reactivity and poor electrochemical reversibility of sodium anodes render sodium metal anode (SMA) cells among the most challenging for practical implementation. Here, the failure mechanisms of Na anodes are investigated and the authors report that loss of morphological control is not the fundamental cause of failure. Rather, it is the inherently poor anchoring/root structure of electrodeposited Na to the electrode substrate that leads to poor reversibility and cell failure. Poorly anchored Na deposits are prone to break away from the current collector, producing orphaning and poor anode utilization. Thin metallic coatings in a range of chemistries are proposed and evaluated as SMA substrates. Based on thermodynamic and ion transport considerations, such substrates undergo reversible alloying reactions with Na and are hypothesized to promote good root growth-regardless of the morphology. Among the various options, Au stands out for its ability to support long Na anode lifetime and high reversibility (Coulombic Efficiency > 98%), for coating thicknesses in the range of 10-1000 nm. As a first step toward evaluating practical utility of the anodes, their performance in Na||SPAN cells with N:P ratio close to 1:1 is evaluated.",

Herein, we demonstrate a stable and high-rate sodium-metal battery enabled by a nonaqueous polyelectrolyte solution composed of a weakly coordinating polyanion-type Na salt, poly[(4-styrenesulfonyl)-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide] (poly(NaSTFSI)) copolymerized with butyl acrylate, in a propylene carbonate solution.

Furthermore, the surface of the Na electrode was modified with polyanion chains anchored via the partial decomposition of the electrolyte. The surface-tethered polyanion layer effectively suppressed the subsequent decomposition of the electrolyte, thereby enabling stable Na deposition/dissolution cycling. Finally, an assembled sodium-metal battery with a Na0.44MnO2 cathode demonstrated an outstanding charge/discharge reversibility (Coulombic efficiency >99.8%) over 200 cycles while also exhibiting a high discharge rate (i.e., 45% capacity retention at 10 mA cm-2).",

However, the practical application of sodium-ion batteries is restricted by unsatisfying capacity and poor rate capability. Herein, a novel mechanism of improving both interfacial and surface charge transfer is proposed by fabricating a graphene oxide/SnO2/Co3O4 nanocomposite through a simple hydrothermal method. The formation of heterostructures between ultrafine SnO2 and Co3O4 could enhance the charge transfer of interfaces owing to the internal electric field. The pseudocapacitive effect, which is led by the high specific area and the existence of ultrafine nanoparticles, takes on a feature of fast faradaic surface charge-transfer. Benefiting from the synergistic advantages of the heterostructures and the pseudocapacitive effect, the as-prepared graphene oxide/SnO2/Co3O4 anode achieved a high reversible capacity of 461 mA h g-1 after 80 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g-1. Additionally, at a high current density of 1 A g-1, a high reversible capacity of 241 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles is obtained. A full cell coupled by the as-prepared graphene oxide/SnO2/Co3O4 anode and the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode was also constructed, which exhibited a reversible capacity of 310.3 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 1 A g-1.

        "abstract": "The construction of anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) with a high energy and a long lifespan is significant and still challenging. Here, sulfur-defective vanadium sulfide/carbon fiber composites (D-V5S8/CNFs) are designed and fabricated by a facile electrospinning method, followed by sulfuration treatment. The unique architecture, in which V5S8 nanoparticles are confined inside the carbon fiber, provides a short-range channel and abundant adsorption sites for ion storage. Moreover, enlarged interlayer spacings could also alleviate the volume changes, and offer small vdW interactions and ionic diffusion resistance to store more Na and K ions reversibly and simultaneously. The DFT calculations further demonstrate that sulfur defects can effectively facilitate the adsorption behavior of Na+ and K+ and offer low energy barriers for ion intercalation. Taking advantage of the functional integration of these merits, the D-V5S8/CNF anode exhibits excellent storage performance and long-term cycling stability. It reveals a high capacity of 462 mA h g-1 at a current density of 0.2 A g-1 in SIBs, while it is 350 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 in PIBs, as well as admirable long-term cycling characteristics (190 mA h g-1/17 000 cycles/5 A g-1 for SIBs and 165 mA h g-1/3000 cycles/1 A g-1 for PIBs). Practically, full SIBs upon pairing with a Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode also exhibit superior performance.",

        "abstract": "Layered metal sulfides (MoS2, WS2, SnS2, and SnS) offer high potential as advanced anode materials in sodium ion batteries upon integration with highly-conductive graphene materials. However, in addition to being costly and time-consuming, existing strategies for synthesizing sulfides/graphene composites often involve complicated procedures. It is therefore essential to develop a simple yet scalable pathway to construct sulfide/graphene composites for practical applications. Here, we highlight a one-step, template-free, high-throughput “self-bubbling” method for producing MoS2/graphene composites, which is suitable for large-scale production of sulfide/graphene composites. The final product featured MoS2 nanoflakes distributed in three-dimensional macroporous monolithic graphene. Moreover, this unique MoS2/graphene composite achieved remarkable electrochemical performance when being applied to Na-ion battery anodes; namely, excellent cycling stability (474 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles) and high rate capability (406 mA h g−1 at 0.25 A g−1 and 359 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1).

        "abstract": "High-surface-area carbon (HSAC) has been regarded as one of the most promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. However, it generally suffers from low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), which is closely related to the formation process of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Herein, the impact of different electrolyte salts on the electrochemical performance and SEI formation of a commercial HSAC anode is studied. It is found that the use of NaCF3SO3 enables much higher ICE (69.28%) and reversible capacity (283 mA h g-1) of the HSAC anode compared with the NaPF6 electrolyte (59.65%, 243 mA h g-1). Through comprehensive characterizations, the improvement in electrochemical performance facilitated by NaCF3SO3 could be attributed to the reduced amount of NaxC and the thinner SEI formed on the surface of HSAC during the initial cycle, which not only provides extra active sites for Na+ storage but also contributes to the promoted ICE. This work not only provides a deeper understanding of the role of electrolyte salt in SEI formation in the HSAC anode but also proposes a new method to further promote the ICE of the HSAC anode in sodium-ion batteries.",

        "title": "Effect of the Particle-Size Distribution on the Electrochemical Performance of a Red Phosphorus–Carbon Composite Anode for Sodium-Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "Red phosphorus (RP) is a promising candidate as an anode for sodium-ion batteries because of its low potential and high specific capacity. It has two main disadvantages. First, it experiences 490% volumetric expansion during sodiation, which leads to particle pulverization and substantial reduction of the cycle life. Second, it has an extremely low electronic conductivity of 10–14 S cm–1. Both issues can be addressed by ball milling RP with a carbon matrix to form a composite of electronically conductive carbon and small RP particles, less susceptible to pulverization. Through this procedure, however, the resulting particle-size distribution of the RP particles is difficult to determine because of the presence of the carbon particles. Here, we quantify the relationship between the RP particle-size distribution and its cycle life for the first time by separating the ball-milling process into two steps. The RP is first wet-milled to reduce the particle size, and then the particle-size distribution is measured via dynamic light scattering. This is followed by a dry-milling step to produce RP–graphite composites. We found that wet milling breaks apart the largest RP particles in the range of 2–10 μm, decreases the Dv90 from 1.85 to 1.26 μm, and significantly increases the cycle life of the RP. Photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy confirm the successful formation of a carbon coating, with longer milling times leading to more uniform carbon coatings. The RP with a Dv90 of 0.79 μm mixed with graphite for 48 h delivered 1354 mA h g–1 with high coulombic efficiency (>99%) and cyclability (88% capacity retention after 100 cycles). These results are an important step in the development of cyclable, high-capacity anodes for sodium-ion batteries.",

However, a lack of suitable anode materials has become a key obstacle for the development of SIBs. Here we explore the potential of the two-dimensional (2D) Y-C space and identify a novel anode material for SIBs, a new Y4C3 sheet with P3̄m1 crystal symmetry, by means of first-principles swarm structure calculations. This Y4C3P3̄m1 structure has rather good kinetic and thermodynamic stability, possesses intrinsic metallicity, and remains metallic after adsorbing Na atoms, ensuring good electrical conductivity during the SIB cycle. Remarkably, a Y4C3 sheet as an anode for SIBs possesses the essential properties of a high specific capacity (∼752 mA h g-1), a low barrier energy (∼0.1 eV), and suitable open-circuit voltage (0-0.15 V). These characteristics are comparable and even superior to those of another known 2D Y2C anode material, indicating that the Y4C3 sheet can act as an appealing new candidate as an anode material for SIBs and offering new insights into the 2D Y-C space.",

Here, K+ ions are introduced as an electrolyte additive to improve the electrochemical performance via electrostatic shielding, using Sn microparticles (μ-Sn) as a model. Theoretical calculations and experimental results indicate that K+ ions are not incorporated in the electrode, but accumulate on some sites. This accumulation slows down the local sodiation at the \"hot spots\", promotes the uniform sodiation and enhances the electrode stability. Therefore, the electrode maintains a high specific capacity of 565 mAh g-1 after 3000 cycles at 2 A g-1, much better than the case without K+. The electrode also remains an areal capacity of ~3.5 mAh cm-2 after 100 cycles.

However, the micron-sized FeS2 usually suffers from poor cyclability, which stems from structure collapse, exfoliation of active materials, and sulfur dissolution. Here, we use a synergistic approach to enhance the sodium storage performance of the micron-sized FeS2 through voltage control (0.5-3 V), binder choice, and graphene coating. The FeS2 electrode with the synergistic approach exhibits high specific capacity (524 mA h g-1), long cycle life (87.8% capacity retention after 800 cycles), and excellent rate capability (323 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1). The results prove that a synergistic approach can be applied in the micron-sized sulfides to achieve high electrochemical performance.",

        "abstract": "Manganese-based chalcogenides would be of latent capacity in serving as anodes for assembling lithium- and/or sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs) due to their large theoretical capacity, low price, and low-toxicity functionality, while the low electroconductivity and easy agglomeration behavior may impede their technical applications. Here, a solid-state solution of MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes in rock-salt phase has been synthesized for the first time at a relatively low temperature from the precursors of Mn(II) acetylacetonate with dibenzyl dichalcogens in oleylamine with octadecene, and the MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes have been assembled with N-doped graphene to form a new kind of heterostructured nanohybrids (shortened as MnS0.5Se0.5/N-G hybrids), which are very potential for the fabrication of metal-ion batteries including LIBs and/or SIBs. Investigations revealed that there have been dense vacancies generated and active sites increased via nonequilibrium alloying of MnS and MnSe into the solid-solution MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes with segregation and defects achieved in the low-temperature solution synthetic route. Meanwhile, the introduction of N-doped graphene forming heterojunction interfaces between MnS0.5Se0.5 and N-doped graphene would efficiently enhance their electroconductivity and avoid agglomeration of the active MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes with considerably improved electrochemical properties. As a result, the MnS0.5Se0.5/N-G hybrids delivered superior Li/Na storage capacities with outstanding rate performance as well as satisfactorily lasting stability (1039/457 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 for LIBs/SIBs). Additionally, full-cell LIBs of the anodic MnS0.5Se0.5/N-G constructed with cathodic LiFePO4 (LFP) further confirmed the promising future for their practical application.",

        "abstract": "MXenes are mentioned in many applications due to their unique properties. However, the traditional etching method has a lengthy synthesis time, dangerous process, and high cost. Molten salt etching is not only short in time but also safe and simple, laying a good foundation for industrialization. Here, we compare the traditional F‐containing etching method with the molten salt etching method. Transmission electron microscopy elemental mapping images and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy show that the Ti3C2Tx surface end of traditional etching is terminated by –F, while the Ti3C2Tx surface end of molten salt etching is terminated by –Cl. Finally, the sodium‐ion batteries are fabricated and the performance difference of the three etching methods is compared. The results show that the capacity of 102.1 mAh g–1 can still be reached when the molten salt etching MXene material returns to 0.1 A g–1 after the current density of 5 A g–1. After 500 cycles at 1 A g–1, there is no significant loss of capacity and the Coulomb efficiency is close to 100%.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) have attracted much attention due to integrating the high energy density of battery and high out power of supercapacitors. However, rapid Na+ diffusion kinetics in cathode is counterbalanced with sluggish anode, hindering the further advancement and commercialization of SIHCs. Here, aiming at conversion-type metal sulfide anode, taking typical VS2 as an example, a comprehensive regulation of nanostructure and electronic properties through NH4 + pre-intercalation and Mo-doping VS2 (Mo-NVS2 ) is reported. It is demonstrated that NH4 + pre-intercalation can enlarge the interplanar spacing and Mo-doping can induce interlayer defects and sulfur vacancies that are favorable to construct new ion transport channels, thus resulting in significantly enhanced Na+ diffusion kinetics and pseudocapacitance. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that the introduction of NH4 + and Mo-doping enhances the electronic conductivity, lowers the diffusion energy barrier of Na+ , and produces stronger d-p hybridization to promote conversion kinetics of Na+ intercalation intermediates. Consequently, Mo-NVS2 delivers a record-high reversible capacity of 453 mAh g-1 at 3 A g-1 and an ultra-stable cycle life of over 20 000 cycles. The assembled SIHCs achieve impressive energy density/power density of 98 Wh kg-1 /11.84 kW kg-1 , ultralong cycling life of over 15000 cycles, and very low self-discharge rate (0.84 mV h-1 ).",

On charge, the supercapacitor removes salt in a flowing saltwater electrolyte through Cl- electrochemical adsorption at the cathode and Na+ intercalation at the anode. Discharge delivers useful electric energy and regenerates the electrodes. This supercapacitor can be used not only for energy storage with promising electrochemical performance (i.e., high power, high efficiency, and long cycle life), but also as a desalination device with desalination capacity of 146.8 mg g-1 , much higher than most reported capacitive and battery desalination devices.

        "abstract": "Metal phosphides exhibit high energy densities as hosts for lithium/sodium storage owing to their conversion reaction mechanism. Nevertheless, they typically suffer from inferior reversibility and cyclability because of the dissolution of polyphosphides and sluggish electrochemical kinetics. Herein, a series of dual‐bond confined MXene‐MxPy‐G composites have been fabricated, in which MxPy nanoparticles are strongly bound with MXene and graphene nanosheets via Ti─P and C‐P bonds. On one hand, the dual‐bond confinement offers strong adsorption to trap polyphosphides, greatly stabilizing the conversion‐formed products during cycling. On the other hand, dual‐bond immobilization largely promotes electron transfer and ion diffusion, facilitating the reversibility of conversion reactions. As anticipated, these MXene‐MxPy‐G hybrids demonstrate superb lithium/sodium‐storage performance. Particularly, as an anode for lithium‐ion batteries, the MXene‐Sn4P3‐G delivers a high initial coulombic efficiency of 90.1% and a high reversible capacity of 1058.6 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1. Even tested at high rates of 1.0/2.0 A g−1, it can still maintain high reversible capacities of 820.6/726.5 mAh g−1 after 1450 cycles. When applied in pouch full‐cells and sodium‐ion batteries, it also shows extended cyclic lifespans of 350 and 1200 cycles. This work provides new insights to improve the reversibility and cyclability of conversion‐type anodes.",

Many biological or waste materials have been used to synthesize hard carbons but the impact of the precursors on the final properties of the anode material is not fully understood. In this study the impact of the biomass source on the structural and electrochemical properties of hard carbons is unraveled by using different, representative types of biomass as examples. The systematic structural and electrochemical investigation of hard carbons derived from different sources-namely corncobs, peanut shells, and waste apples, which are representative of hemicellulose-, lignin- and pectin-rich biomass, respectively-enables understanding and interlinking of the structural and electrochemical properties.",

        "abstract": "Exploiting novel nanomaterials with fast and durable sodium/potassium ion storage capability is key to alleviate the application limitations of lithium-ion batteries. Herein, a novel energy storage material based on cobalt metaphosphate nanosheet arrays self-supported on carbon cloths [Co(PO3)2 NSs/CC] is fabricated by a two-step strategy. This rationally designed strategy avoids the preparation of the complex {Co[O2P(OtBu)2]2}n precursor, which significantly simplifies the synthesis process. The active CC acts not only as an electrically conductive substrate as usual but also as a functional basis to suppress PH3-involved reaction and to promote HPO3-involved reaction during the phosphating process, contributing to the formation of Co(PO3)2. The mutual cross-linked porous Co(PO3)2 nanosheets vertically grow on the surface of activated CC, ensuring sufficient electrolyte infiltration and fast electron transport among the electrodes. Sodium ion storage analysis for the Co(PO3)2 NSs/CC electrode reveals a multi-step reaction mechanism with high reversibility, as reflected by the high reversible capacity (667 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1) and excellent cyclability (with almost no capacity decay over 500 cycles). This novel electrode is also well capable of storing potassium ions, exhibiting high reversible capacity, which outperforms most reported anodes for potassium-ion batteries.

Herein, a simple process is demonstrated to improve the sodium storage performance of TiO2 by fabricating a 1D, multichannel, porous binary-phase anatase-TiO2 -rutile-TiO2 composite with oxygen-deficient and high grain-boundary density (denoted as a-TiO2-x /r-TiO2-x ) via electrospinning and subsequent vacuum treatment. The introduction of oxygen vacancies in the TiO2 matrix enables enhanced intrinsic electronic conductivity and fast sodium-ion diffusion kinetics. The porous structure offers easy access of the liquid electrolyte and a short transport path of Na+ through the pores toward the TiO2 nanoparticle. Furthermore, the high density of grain boundaries between the anatase TiO2 and rutile TiO2 offer more interfaces for a novel interfacial storage. The a-TiO2-x /r-TiO2-x shows excellent long cycling stability (134 mAh g-1 at 10 C after 4500 cycles) and superior rate performance (93 mAh g-1 after 4500 cycles at 20 C) for sodium-ion batteries.

Toward addressing this challenge, the authors report the synthesis and characterization of a new iron-doped Na3Fe0.3V1.7O(PO4)2F2 cathode using a novel facile hydrothermal route. The synthesized material was characterized using x ray diffraction, Mössbauer spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy techniques. Obtained discharge capacity in half-cell configuration lies from 119 to 125 to 130 mAh/g at C/10 while tested using three different electrolyte formulations, DMC-EC-PC, DEC-EC, and EC-PC, respectively. The synthesized cathodes were also evaluated in full-cell configurations, which delivered an initial discharge capacity of 80 mAh/g with NaTi2(PO4)3MWCNT as the anode. Ionic diffusivity and interfacial charge transfer kinetics were also evaluated as a function of temperature and sodium concentration, which revealed that electrochemical rate performances in this material were limited by charge transfer kinetics. To understand the heat generation mechanism of the Na/Na3Fe0.3V1.7O(PO4)2F2 half-cell during charge and discharge processes, an electrochemical isothermal calorimetry measurement was carried out at different current rates for two different temperatures (25 and 45°C). The results showed that the amount of heat generated was strongly affected by the operating charge/discharge state, C-rate, and temperature. Overall, this work provides a new synthesis route for the development of iron-doped Na3Fe0.3V1.7O(PO4)2F2-based high-performance sodium cathode material aimed at providing a viable pathway for the development and deployment of large-scale energy storage based on sodium battery systems.",

However, it is troubled by a low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) due to its porous structure. Herein, a graphitized and ultrathin carbon layer coating on HC is proposed to solve this challenge. The as-prepared porous carbon material coated with an ultrathin carbon layer composite (PCS@V@C) exhibits a cavity structure, which is prepared by using bis(cyclopentadienyl) nickel (CP-Ni) as the carbon source for outer coating, glucose carbon spheres as porous carbon, and introducing a silica layer to facilitate the coating process. When utilized as the anode for NIBs, the material shows an ICE increase from 47.1% to 85.3%, and specific capacity enhancement at 0.1 A g-1 from 155.3 to 216.7 mA h g-1. Moreover, its rate capability and cycling performance are outstanding, demonstrating a capacity of 140.3 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1, and a retaining capacity of 225.6 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 with the Coulombic efficiency of 100% at the second cycle. The excellent electrochemical performance of the PCS@V@C is attributed to the ultrathin carbon layer, which is beneficial for the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film. Therefore, this study provides a feasible surface modification method for the preparation of anode materials for NIBs with high specific capacity and ICE.",

        "abstract": "Using first-principles swarm intelligence structure prediction computations, we explore a fully planar BGe monolayer with unique mechanical and electrical properties. Theoretical calculations reveal that a free-standing BGe monolayer has excellent stability, which is confirmed by the cohesive energy (compared to experimentally synthetic borophene and germanene monolayers), phonon modes (no imaginary frequencies appeared in the phonon spectrum), ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations (no broken bonds and geometric reconstructions), and mechanical stability criteria. The metallic feature of the BGe monolayer can be maintained after absorbing different numbers of Na atoms, ensuring good electronic conductivity during the charge/discharge process. The calculated migration energy barrier, open-circuit voltage, and theoretical specific capacity of the BGe monolayer are much better than those of some other two-dimensional (2D) materials. These findings render the BGe monolayer a potential candidate for reversible Na-ion battery anode materials with desirable performance.",

        "abstract": "Tin diselenide, a promising anode material for sodium ion batteries (SIBs), still faces sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics and severe volume change, resulting in undesirable cycling stability and rate capability. Heterostructure construction is an effective strategy for boosting Na+ storage of SnSe2. Herein, an appealing yolk‐shell nanostructure of SnSe2/NiSe2 heterointerface with rich Se vacancies embedded into N‐doped carbon (SnSe2/NiSe2@NC) is precisely designed through a facile hydrothermal process followed by a selenization strategy. The experimental studies coupled with theoretical calculations results verify that the heterostructure interfaces and Se vacancies accelerate the charge and Na+ transfer efficiency, improve Na+ adsorption energy and supply ample active sites. The yolk‐shell nanostructure and N‐doped carbon buffer the volume variation and improve the structural stability of the electrode material during sodium storage processes. The SnSe2/NiSe2@NC delivers ultra‐long term cycling stability (322.7 mAh g−1 after 7500 cycles at 3 A g−1) and exceptional rate capability (314.6 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1). The Na‐ion storage mechanism of SnSe2/NiSe2@NC is explored through in situ X‐ray diffraction and ex situ high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis. The present work provides an effective avenue to the rational design of heterostructure anode materials for high efficiency SIBs.",

        "title": "Abnormal Gas Generation during First Discharge Process of Sodium Ion Battery.",
        "abstract": "In recent years, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted a lot of attention and are considered an ideal alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The hard carbon (HC) anode in SIBs presents a unique challenge for studying the formation process of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during initial cycling, owing to its distinctive porous structure. This study employs a combination of ultrasonic scanning techniques and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry to conduct an in-depth analysis of the two-dimensional distribution and composition of gases during the formation process. The findings reveal distinct gas evolution behaviors in SIBs compared to LIBs during formation. Notably, significant gas evolution is observed during the discharge phase of the formation cycle in SIBs, with higher discharge rates leading to increased gas evolution rates. This phenomenon is likely attributed to the adsorption of CO2 gas by the abundant pores in HC, followed by desorption during discharge. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the addition of 5A molecular sieves, which competitively adsorb gases, effectively reduces gas adsorption on the anode during formation, thereby significantly enhancing battery performance. This research elucidates the gas adsorption and desorption behavior at the battery interface, providing new insights into the SEI formation process in SIBs.",

One of the main challenges for sodium-ion batteries, however, is the poor electrolyte stability, which leads to rapid capacity fade during cycling. Recent advances in the lithium-ion-battery field have expanded our understanding of electrolyte compositions and stability, paving the way for better sodium-ion-battery electrolytes. Two of the most promising new classes of electrolytes are evaluated herein with a sodium layered-oxide cathode, for the first time: a localized high-concentration electrolyte (LHCE) composed of sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide, dimethyl ether, and tetrafluoropropyl ether and a \"highly fluorinated\" electrolyte (HFE) composed of 20% fluoroethylene carbonate with a lithium difluorophosphate additive. With a combination of electrochemical and post-mortem characterization techniques, the stability of each electrolyte is assessed with the O3-type Na(Ni0.3Fe0.4Mn0.3)O2 cathode and sodium metal anode. Both electrolytes significantly improve the surface and bulk stability of the cathode, but only the LHCE has a meaningful improvement on sodium metal stability. For the purpose of developing a long-lasting, sodium-ion full cell, both classes of electrolyte show great promise.",

        "abstract": "In recent times, few-layer black phosphorus (BP) has attracted tremendous attention as a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries due to its particular two-dimensional structure, good electron conductivity, and high theoretical capacity. The main disadvantages of BP-based materials are the lower practical specific capacity of the BP-based composite than expectation because of the low P atom utilization and the structural fracture due to the large volume expansion that occurs during sodiation/desodiation cycles. In this work, we report a ternary composite comprising BP, graphite, and polyaniline (BP-G/PANI) with a BP mass content of ∼65 wt %. The ternary composite provides an optimized ion pathway (electrolyte → PANI → BP-G → BP), which reduces the charge transfer resistance of the electrode. Also, further ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that the presence of graphite in the BP-G composite allows a deep sodiation of BP and also leads to a higher sodiation/desodiation reversibility. In addition, the uniformly coated PANI also restricts the huge volume expansion of the BP electrode through discharge/charge processes, which promise the stable cycling performance of BP-G/PANI. Thus, our composite shows a high reversible gravimetric capacity of 1530 mAh gcompo.-1 at 0.25 A g-1 and a capacity retention of 520 mAh gcompo.-1 after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 4 A g-1.",

ALD is known to improve the cycling performance, Coulombic efficiency of batteries, and maintain electrode integrity. Here, the electrochemical performance of uncoated P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 electrodes is compared to that of ALD-coated Al2O3 P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 electrodes. Given that ALD coatings are in the early stage of development for NIB cathode materials, little is known about how ALD coatings, in particular aluminum oxide (Al2O3), affect the electrode-electrolyte interface. Therefore, full characterizations of its effects are presented in this work. For the first time, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to elucidate the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on ALD-coated electrodes. It contains less carbonate species and more inorganic species, which allows for fast Na kinetics, resulting in significant increase in Coulombic efficiency and decrease in cathode impedance. The effectiveness of Al2O3 ALD coating is also surprisingly reflected in the enhanced mechanical stability of the particle which prevents particle exfoliation.",

        "abstract": "Aqueous sodium‐ion battery of low cost, inherent safety, and environmental benignity holds substantial promise for new‐generation energy storage applications. However, the narrow potential window of water and the enlarged ionic radius because of hydration restrict the selection of electrode materials used in the aqueous electrolyte. Here, inspired by the efficient redox reaction of biomolecules during cellular energy metabolism, a proof of concept is proposed that the redox‐active biomolecule alizarin can act as a novel electrode material for the aqueous sodium‐ion battery. It is demonstrated that the specific capacity of the self‐assembled alizarin nanowires can reach as high as 233.1 mA h g−1, surpassing the majority of anodes ever utilized in the aqueous sodium‐ion batteries. Paired with biocompatible and biodegradable polypyrrole, this full battery system shows excellent sodium storage ability and flexibility, indicating its potential applications in wearable electronics and biointegrated devices. It is also shown that the electrochemical properties of electrodes can be tailored by manipulating naturally occurring 9,10‐anthroquinones with various substituent groups, which broadens application prospect of biomolecules in aqueous sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The Fe‐based anode of sodium‐ion batteries attracts much attention due to the abundant source, low‐cost, and high specific capacity. However, the low electron and ion transfer rate, poor structural stability, and shuttle effect of NaS2 intermediate restrain its further development. Herein, the Fe3O4/Fe/FeS tri‐heterojunction node spawned N‐carbon nanotube scaffold structure (FHNCS) was designed using the modified MIL‐88B(Fe) as a template followed by catalytic growth and sulfidation process. During catalytic growth process, the reduced Fe monomers catalyze the growth of N‐doped carbon nanotubes to connect the Fe3O4/Fe/FeS tri‐heterojunction node, forming a 3D scaffold structure. Wherein the N‐doped carbon promotes the transfer of electrons between Fe3O4/Fe/FeS particles, and the tri‐heterojunction facilitates the diffusion of electrons at the interface, to organize a 3D conductive network. The unique scaffold structure provides more active sites and shortens the Na+ diffusion path. Meanwhile, the structure exhibits excellent mechanical stability to alleviate the volume expansion during circulation. Furthermore, the Fe in Fe3O4/Fe heterojunction can adjust the d‐band center of Fe in Fe3O4 to enhance the adsorption between Fe3O4 and Na2S intermediate, which restrains the shuttle effect. Therefore, the FHNCS demonstrates a high specific capacity of 436 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, 84.7% and 73.4% of the initial capacities are maintained after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 and 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1. We believe that this strategy gives an inspiration for constructing Fe‐based anode with excellent rate capability and cycling stability.",

        "abstract": "SnSb alloy, which can be used as an anode in a sodium-ion cell, was synthesized following a resource-efficient route at low temperature. This one-pot approach greatly reduces the energy consumption and maximizes the efficient use of raw materials. The reaction of elemental tin and antimony in the ionic liquid (IL) trihexyltetradecylphosphonium chloride ([P66614]Cl) at 200 °C led to a microcrystalline powder of single-phase SnSb within 10 h with very high yield (95%). Liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that the IL remains essentially stable during the reaction. It was recovered almost quantitatively by distilling off the organic solvent used for product separation. Composites of SnSb powder and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were fabricated by a simple ball milling process. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the Na‖SnSb/CNTs cell retains close to 100% of its initial capacity after 50 cycles at a current of 50 mA g−1, which is much better than the Na‖SnSb cell. The greatly increased capacity retainability can be attributed to the conductive network formed by CNTs inside the SnSb/CNTs electrode, providing 3D effective and fast electronic pathways during sodium intercalation and de-intercalation.",

        "abstract": "Phosphorus doping is an effective strategy to simultaneously improve the electronic conductivity and regulate the ionic diffusion kinetics of TiO2 being considered as anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). However, efficient phosphorus doping with high concentration in well-crystallized TiO2 nanoparticles is still a big challenge. Herein, we propose a defect-assisted phosphorus doping strategy to selectively engineer the surface structure of TiO2 nanoparticles. The reduced TiO2-x shell layer that is rich of oxygen defects and Ti3+ species precisely triggered high concentration of phosphorus doping (~7.8 at%) and consequently a TiO2@TiO2-x-P core@shell architecture was produced. Comprehensive characterizations and first-principle calculations proved that the surface functionalized TiO2-x-P thin layer endowed the TiO2@TiO2-x-P with substantially enhanced electronic conductivity and accelerated Na ions transportation, resulting in great rate capability (167 mA h g-1 at 10000 mA g-1) and stable cycling (99% after 5000 cycles at 10 A g-1). Combining in/ex situ X-ray diffraction with ex situ electron spin resonance clearly demonstrated the high reversibility and robust mechanical behavior of the TiO2@TiO2-x-P upon long-term cycling. This work provides an interesting and effective strategy for precise heteroatoms doping to improve the electrochemical performance of nanoparticles.",

        "abstract": "Antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries due to its low cost and high theoretical specific capacity. However, poor stability and a complex preparation process limit its large-scale application. Herein, we prepare a binder-free composite electrode composed of amorphous (α-) Sb2S3 and copper antimony sulfide (CuSbS2) through a simple closed-space sublimation (CSS) method. When applied as the anode in sodium-ion batteries, the α-Sb2S3@CuSbS2 electrode exhibits excellent performance with a high discharge capacity of 506.7 mA h g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1 after 50 cycles. The satisfactory electrochemical performance could be ascribed to the α-Sb2S3–CuSbS2 composite structure and binder-free electrode architecture, which not only retain the structural stability of the electrode but also improve the electrical conductivity. Consequently, CSS, as a scalable and environmentally friendly method, can produce a binder-free electrode in just a few minutes, demonstrating its great potential in the industrial production of sodium-ion batteries. This study may open an avenue to preparing binder-free commercial electrodes.",

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) is emerging as a popular cathode for sodium-ion batteries owing to its stable structure, high operating voltage, and large energy density. However, its practical application is hindered by its low conductivity. In addition, due to the loss of fluorine during synthesis, Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) impurity is often easily generated, resulting in a decrease in actual operating voltage. Herein, a bifunctional carbon network composed of an N-doped carbon layer and carbon bridge is constructed around NVPF particles. Through pyrolysis of polydopamine (PDA), the NVPF particles are covered in situ by an N-doped carbon layer, and the carbon bridge generated by polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is also coated with N-doped carbon. Besides, PTFE also serves as a fluorine supplement to ensure that pure NVPF is obtained. As a result, the bifunctional N-doped carbon network-modified NVPF delivers a high reversible capacity (125.7 mA h g-1 at 0.2 C) and appreciable cycle stability (92.7% at 1 C over 300 cycles, and 89.8% at 10 C over 1500 cycles). When assembled into a full cell with a commercial hard carbon anode, it displays a discharge median voltage of up to 3.62 V at 0.2 C. Furthermore, it achieves a high energy density of 373.7 W h kg-1 at a power density of 461.2 W kg-1, with an excellent specific energy retention of 78.2% after 200 cycles. Therefore, this modification method is expected to be extended to other fluorine-containing materials with poor electrical conductivity.",

It is found that Nb doping gives rise to the expansion of cell volume but V doping induces the shrinkage of cell volume due to the larger and smaller ionic radius of the Nb and V ions, respectively, compared to that of the Ti ion. We perform structural optimization of the intermediate phases of Na2+xM3O7 with increasing Na content x from 0 to 2, revealing that the overall relative volume expansion rate is slightly increased by Nb and V doping but remains lower than 3%. Our calculations demonstrate that the electrode potential of NTO is slightly raised and the specific capacity is reduced, but the electronic and ionic conductivities are improved by Nb or V doping.

As-designed biphasic TMSe heterostructure endows unique hierarchical structure, which contains adequate insertion sites and diffusion spacing for Na ions, besides, the surficial pseudocapacitive storage behaviors can be also proceeded like 2D MXene. By further investigation on electronic structure, the theoretical calculations indicate that biphasic CuSe/Cu3 VSe4 anode exhibits well-enhanced properties, with smaller bandgap and thus greatly improves intrinsic poor conductivities. In addition, the dual redox centers can enhance the electrochemical Na ions storage abilities. As a result, the as-designed biphasic TMSe anode can deliver a reversible specific capacity of 576.8 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 , favorable Na affinity, and reduced diffusion barriers. This work discloses a synchronous solution toward demerits in conductivities and lifespan, which is inspiring for TMSe-based anode development in SIBs systems.",

        "abstract": "Organic materials are competitive as anodes for Na-ion batteries (NIBs) due to the low cost, abundance, environmental benignity, and high sustainability. Herein, we synthesized three halogenated carboxylate-based organic anode materials to exploit the impact of halogen atoms (F, Cl, and Br) on the electrochemical performance of carboxylate anodes in NIBs. The fluorinated carboxylate anode, disodium 2, 5-difluoroterephthalate (DFTP-Na), outperforms the other carboxylate anodes with H, Cl, and Br, in terms of high specific capacity (212 mA h g-1), long cycle life (300 cycles), and high rate capability (up to 5 A g-1). As evidenced by the experimental and computational results, the two F atoms in DFTP reduce the solubility, enhance the cyclic stability, and interact with Na+ during the redox reaction, resulting in a high-capacity and stable organic anode material in NIBs. Therefore, this work proves that fluorinating carboxylate compounds is an effective approach to developing high-performance organic anodes for stable and sustainable NIBs.",

        "abstract": "The demand for energy storage devices has increased significantly, and the sustainable development of lithium-ion batteries is limited by scarce lithium resources. Therefore, alternative sodium-ion batteries which are rich in resource may become more competitive in the future market. In this work, we synthesized low-cost SnS2/C and FeS2/C anode materials of sodium-ion batteries which used waste crab shells as biomass carbon precursor. The SnS2 nanosheet and FeS2 nanosphere structures are deposited on the crab shell-derived carbon through simple hydrothermal reaction. Due to the coexistence of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and crab-derived biomass carbon, the anode material has excellent cycle stability and rate performance. SnS2/C and FeS2/C deliver capacities of 535.4 and 479 mA h g–1 at the current density of 0.1 A g–1, respectively.

        "abstract": "While cost‐effective sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) with crystalline silicon anodes promise high theoretical capacities, they perform poorly because silicon stores sodium ineffectively (capacity <40 mAh g−1). To address this issue, herein an atomic‐order structural‐design tactic is adopted for obtaining unique multilevel gradient‐ordered silicon (MGO‐Si) by simple electrochemical reconstruction. In situ‐formed short‐range‐, medium‐range‐, and long‐range‐ordered structures construct a stable MGO‐Si, which contributes to favorable Na–Si interaction and fast ion diffusion channels. These characteristics afford a high reversible capacity (352.7 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1) and stable cycling performance (95.2% capacity retention after 4000 cycles), exhibiting record values among those reported for pure silicon electrodes. Sodium storage of MGO‐Si involves an adsorption–intercalation mechanism, and a stepwise construction strategy of gradient‐ordered structure further improves the specific capacity (339.5 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1). Reconstructed Si/C composites show a high reversible capacity of 449.5 mAh g−1, significantly better than most carbonaceous anodes. The universality of this design principle is demonstrated for other inert or low‐capacity materials (micro‐Si, SiO2, SiC, graphite, and TiO2), boosting their capacities by 1.5–6 times that of pristine materials, thereby providing new solutions to facilitate sodium storage capability for better‐performing battery designs.",

        "abstract": "Currently, the limited availability of lithium sources is escalating the cost of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Considering the fluctuating economics of LIBs, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have now drawn attention because sodium is an earth-abundant, low-cost element that exhibits similar chemistry to that of LIBs. Despite developments in different anode materials, there still remain several challenges in SIBs, including lighter cell design for SIBs. The presented work designs a facile strategy to prepare nitrogen-doped free-standing pseudo-graphitic nanofibers via electrospinning. A structural and morphological study implies highly disordered graphitic structured nanofibers having diameters of ∼120–170 nm, with a smooth surface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed that nitrogen was successfully doped in carbon nanofibers (CNFs). When served as an anode material for SIBs, the resultant material exhibits excellent sodium-ion storage properties in terms of long-term cycling stability and high rate capability. Notably, a binder-free self-standing CNF without a current collector was used as an anode for SIBs that delivered capacities of 210 and 87 mA h g–1 at 20 and 1600 mA g–1, respectively, retaining a capacity of 177 mA h g–1 when retained at 20 mA g–1. The as-synthesized CNFs demonstrate a long cycle life with a relatively high Columbic efficiency of 98.6% for the 900th cycle, with a stable and excellent rate capacity. The sodium storage mechanisms of the CNFs were examined with various nitrogen concentrations and carbonization temperatures. Furthermore, the diffusion coefficients of the sodium ions based on the electrochemical impedance spectra measurement have been calculated in the range of 10–15–10–12 cm2 s–1, revealing excellent diffusion mobility for Na atoms in the CNFs. This study demonstrates that optimum nitrogen doping and carbonization temperature demonstrated a lower Warburg coefficient and a higher Na-ion diffusion coefficient leads to enhanced stable electrochemical performance. Thus, our study shows that the nitrogen-doped CNFs will have potential for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Electrochemical performance of the layered compound CrPS4 for the usage as anode material in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) was examined and exceptional reversible long-term capacity and capacity retention were found. After 300 cycles, an extraordinary reversible capacity of 687 mAh g-1 at a current rate of 1 A g-1 was achieved, while rate capability tests showed an excellent capacity retention of 100%. Detailed evaluation of the data evidence a change of the electrochemical reaction upon cycling leading to the striking long-term performance. Further investigations targeted the reaction mechanism of the first cycle by applying complementary techniques, i.e., powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), pair distribution function (PDF) analysis, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and 23Na/31P magic-angle-spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The results indicated an unexpectedly complex reaction pathway including formation of several intercalation compounds, depending on the amount of Na inserted at the early discharge states and subsequent conversion to Na2S and strongly disordered metallic Cr at the completely discharged state. While XAS measurements suggest no further presence of intermediates after formation of Na intercalation compounds, several different phases are detected via MAS NMR upon continued discharging. Especially the data obtained from the MAS NMR investigations therefore point toward a very complex reaction pathway. Furthermore, solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation, resulting in the presence of NaF, was observed. After recharging the anode material, no structural long-range order occurred, but short-range order indeed resembled the local environment of the starting material, to a certain extent.",

The Na-storage mechanism was systematically studied, revealing that MnFe2O4 is converted into metallic Mn and Fe after the first discharge (MnFe2O4 + 8Na(+) + 8e(-) → Mn + 2Fe + 4Na2O) and then to MnO and Fe2O3 during the following charge (Mn + 2Fe + 4Na2O → MnO + Fe2O3 + 8Na(+) + 8e(-)). The subsequent cycles occur through reversible redox reactions of MnO + Fe2O3 + 8Na(+) + 8e(-) ↔ Mn + 2Fe + 4Na2O, of which the reduction/oxidation of MnO/Mn takes place at a lower potential than that of Fe2O3/Fe. Furthermore, a soft package sodium-ion full battery with MFO@C anode and Na3V2(PO4)2F3/C cathode was assembled, delivering a stable capacity of ∼400 mA h g(-1) for MFO@C (with 100 cycles at 500 mA g(-1)) and a promising energy density of 77.8 Wh kg(-1) for the whole battery. This is owing to the distinctive structure of very-fine MnFe2O4 nanodots embedded in porous N-doped carbon nanofibers, which effectively improves the utilization rate of active materials, facilitates the transportation of electrons and Na(+) ions, and prevents the particle pulverization/agglomeration upon prolonged cycling.",

The electrochemical performances of sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles are studied as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. The galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements have been performed in a voltage range of 0.01-2.6 V vs. Na(+)/Na under different current densities, using the as-prepared sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles as a working electrode. Typically, the initial discharge and charge capacities of sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles are 475 and 380 mA h g(-1), respectively, at a current density of 20 mA g(-1). The sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles exhibit high capacity with a reversible discharge capacity of about 190 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles. It should be emphasized that the discharge reaction consists of two steps which correspond to voltage plateaus of 0.93 V and 0.85 V vs. Na(+)/Na in the first discharge curve of the Na/MoS2 battery, respectively. But there is only one apparent voltage plateau in the Na/Na-Mo-S battery, and it reduces to below 0.5 V vs. Na(+)/Na, which can enhance the power density.

Herein, the micro/nanostructural Sb/graphene composite (Sb-O-G) is successfully prepared with the uniform Sb nanospheres (∼100 nm) bound on the graphene via oxygen bonds. It is revealed that the in-situ-constructed oxygen bonds play a significant role on enhancing Na-storage properties, especially the ultrafast charge/discharge capability.

More importantly, this Sb-O-G anode achieves ultrafast (120 C) energy storage in SIB full cells, which have already been shown to power a 26-bulb array and calculator.

        "abstract": "To design a high-performance sodium-ion battery (SIB) anode, binary zinc phosphides (ZnP2 and Zn3P2) were synthesized by a facile solid-state heat treatment process, and their Na storage characteristics were evaluated. The Na reactivity of ZnP2 was better than that of Zn3P2. Therefore, a C-modified ZnP2-based composite (ZnP2-C) was fabricated to achieve better electrochemical performance. To investigate the electrochemical reaction mechanism of ZnP2-C during sodiation/desodiaiton, various ex-situ analytical techniques were employed. During sodiation, ZnP2 in the composite was transformed into NaZn13 and Na3P phases, exhibiting a one-step conversion reaction. Conversely, Zn and P in the NaZn13 and the Na3P, respectively, were fully recombined to the original ZnP2 phase during desodiation. Owing to the one-step conversion/recombination of ZnP2 in the composite during cycling, ZnP2-C showed high electrochemical performance with a highly reversible capacity of 883 mAh g-1 after 130 cycles with no capacity deterioration and a fast C-rate capability of 500 mAh g-1 at 1C and 350 mAh g-1 at 3C.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) have drawn remarkable attention due to their low cost and the practically inexhaustible sodium sources. The major obstacle for the practical application of SIBs is the absence of suitable negative electrode materials with long cycling stability and high rate performance. Here, sulfur‐doped double‐shell sodium titanate (Na2Ti3O7) microspheres constructed from 2D ultrathin nanosheets are synthesized via a templating route combined with a low‐temperature sulfurization process. The resulting double‐shell microspheres deliver a high specific capacity (≈222 mAh g−1 at 1 C), excellent cycling stability (162 mAh g−1 after 15 000 cycles at 20 C), and superior rate capability (122 mAh g−1 at 50 C) as anode for SIBs. The improved electrochemical properties originate from synergistic effects between the unique double‐shell nanostructures built from 2D nanosheets architecture and sulfur doping. This synergistic effect not only stabilize Na2Ti3O7‐based electrode during the cycling, but also improve the sluggish Na insertion/extraction kinetics by narrowing the bandgap of Na2Ti3O7. The synthesis strategy proposed here can be developed into a technical rationale for generating high‐performance sodium‐storage devices.",

        "abstract": "Carbonaceous materials are considered strong candidates as anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), which are expected to play an indispensable role in the carbon‐neutral era. Herein, novel braided porous carbon fibres (BPCFs) are prepared using the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method. The BPCFs possess interwoven porous structures and abundant vacancies. The growth mechanism of the BPCFs can be attributed to the polycrystalline transformation of the nanoporous copper catalyst in the early stage of CVD process. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the Na+ adsorption energies of the mono‐vacancy edges of the BPCFs (−1.22 and −1.09 eV) are lower than that of an ideal graphene layer (−0.68 eV), clarifying in detail the adsorption‐dominated sodium storage mechanism. Hence, the BPCFs as an anode material present an outstanding discharge capacity of 401 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 500 cycles. Remarkably, this BPCFs anode, under high‐mass‐loading of 5 mg cm−2, shows excellent long‐term cycling ability with a reversible capacity of 201 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1 over 1000 cycles.

        "abstract": "Metal phosphorus trichalcogenides have been regarded as promising high-capacity anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high reversible capacity. Nevertheless, their practical application is plagued by poor diffusion kinetics and dramatic volume fluctuations during the charge-discharge process, resulting in no satisfactory rate and life span so far. Herein, we propose a space-confinement strategy to remarkably promote the cycling stability and rate capacity by embedding FePS3 particles in the interlayer of expanded graphite (EG), which are derived from in situ transformation of graphite intercalation compounds. The layered EG not only greatly alleviates the volume fluctuations of FePS3 by the space confinement effect so as to maintain the stability of the electrode microstructure, but it also ensures rapid Na+ and electron transfer during cycling. When acting as an anode for SIBs, the hybrid electrode delivers a highly reversible capacity of 312.5 mAh g-1 at an ultrahigh rate of 50 A g-1 while retaining an ultralong life span of 1300 cycles with a retention of 82.4% at 10 A g-1. Moreover, the excellent performance of the assembled full battery indicates the practical application potential of FPS/EG.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfides are recognized as an excellent alternative to sodium ion anodes ascribed to the outstanding theoretical capacity. The unique crystal arrangement of VS4 gives it exceptional theoretical capacity, despite challenges like insufficient electrical conductivity and undesirable volume expansion. Herein, a novel stabilized anode featuring a distinctive 3D hollow spherical structure is proposed, providing a simple strategy to synthesize such anodes for VS4-HCMSs bonded via C-O-S and V-O-C interfaces. The kinetic investigations and density functional theory reveal that the unique structure connected by interfacial bonds enhances Na+ transport rate and charge transfer efficiency, while carbon greatly mitigates the volume expansion. Unsurprisingly, the VS4-HCMSs exhibit an impressive first-cycle Coulombic efficiency of 91.31% and an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 612 mAh g-1 after 300 cycles at 0.5 A g-1, even exhibit the reversible capacity of 498.8 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 5 A g-1. Additionally, the NaFePO4//VS4-HCMSs full cell is cycled for 200 cycles at 0.2 C and powered the light-emitting diodes for up to 30 minutes afterward. Overall, this work enhances the conductivity and stability of the material by combining VS4 with hollow carbon mesoporous spheres through interfacial bonding, offering an efficient strategy to anode materials in sodium-ion batteries.",

Herein, an \"embryo\" strategy is proposed for synthesis of nanorod-embedded MoO2 /MoS2 /C network nanoarchitecture as anode for SIBs with high-rate performance. Interestingly, L-cysteine which plays triple roles including sulfur source, reductant, and carbon source can be utilized to produce the sulfur vacancy-enriched heterostructure. Specifically, L-cysteine can combine with metastable monoclinic MoO3 nanorods at room temperature to encapsulate the \"nutrient\" of MoOx analogues (MoO2.5 (OH)0.5 and MoO3 ·0.5H2 O) and hydrogen-deficient L-cysteine in the \"embryo\" precursor affording for subsequent in situ multistep heating treatment. The resultant MoO2 /MoS2 /C presents a high-rate capability of 875 and 420 mAh g-1 at 0.5 and 10 A g-1 , respectively, which are much better than the MoS2 -based anode materials reported by far. Finite element simulation and analysis results verify that the volume expansion can be reduced to 42.8% from 88.8% when building nanorod-embedded porous network structure. Theoretical calculations reveal that the sulfur vacancies and heterointerface engineering can promote the adsorption and migration of Na+ leading to highly enhanced thermodynamic and kinetic reaction.

        "abstract": "The development of 1D nanostructures with enhanced material properties has been an attractive endeavor for applications in energy and environmental fields, but it remains a major research challenge. Herein, this work demonstrates a simple, gel‐derived method to synthesize uniform 1D elongated sub‐nanotubes with an anatase/bronze TiO2 nanocrystal wall (TiO2 SNTs). The transformation mechanism of TiO2 SNTs is studied by various ex situ characterization techniques. The resulting 1D nanostructures exhibit, synchronously, a high aspect ratio, open tubular interior, and anatase/bronze nanocrystal TiO2 wall. This results in excellent properties of electron/ion transport and reaction kinetics. Consequently, as an anode material for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), the TiO2 SNTs display an ultrastable long‐life cycling stability with a capacity of 107 mAh g−1 at 16 C after 4000 cycles and a high‐rate capacity of 94 mAh g−1 at 32 C.

In this work, a monolithic sodium ion battery based on a Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 cathode, MoS2 layered anode, and polyether-based polymer electrolyte is reported. In addition, a new kind of polysulfonamide-supported poly(ethylene glycol) divinyl ether based polymer electrolyte is also demonstrated for monolithic sodium ion battery via in situ preparation. The resultant polymer electrolyte exhibits relatively high ionic conductivity (1.2 mS cm-1 ) at ambient temperature, wide electrochemical window (4.7 V), and favorable mechanical strength (25 MPa). Moreover, such a monolithic Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 /MoS2 sodium ion battery using this polymer electrolyte delivers outstanding rate capability (up to 10 C) and superior cyclic stability (84%) after 1000 cycles at 0.5 C. What is more essential, such a polymer electrolyte based soft-package monolithic sodium ion cell can still power a red light emitting diode lamp and run finite times without suffering from any internal short-circuit failures, even in the case of a bended and wrinkled state.

Nonetheless, the implementation of NIBs is seriously hindered because of their low rate capability and cycling stability. This is mainly because the large ionic size of Na+ can reduce the structural stability and cause sluggish reaction kinetics of electrode materials. Herein, three-dimensional nanoarchitectured coral-like CoSe2@N-doped carbon (CL-CoSe2@NC) was synthesized through solvothermal and selenizing techniques. As a result, CL-CoSe2@NC for NIBs at 2 A g-1 exhibits an ultrahigh specific capacity of 345.4 mA h g-1 after 2800 cycles and a superhigh initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 93.1%. Ex situ XRD, HRTEM, SAED and XPS were executed to study the crystal structure evolution between Na and CoSe2 during sodiation/de-sodiation processes. The aforementioned results indicate that the improved sodium storage property of CL-CoSe2@NC could be attributed to better electrode kinetics and a stable SEI film because of the 3D nanoarchitecture and the existence of the NC layer.",

As well, carbonaceous materials, as a crucial additive, can effectively ameliorate the ion/electron conductivity of integrated composites, realizing the fast ion transport and charge transfer. Here, motivated by the enhancement effect of carbon and heterojunction on conductivity, it is proposed that the CoSe2 /WSe2 heterojunction as inner core is coated by carbon outer shell and uniformly embedded in porous carbon nanosheets (denoted as CoSe2 /WSe2 @C/CNs), which is used as anode material for SIBs. Combining with density functional theoretical calculations, it is confirmed that the structure of heterojunction can introduce built-in electric-field, which can accelerate the transportation of Na+ and improve the conductivity of electrons. Moreover, the introduction of porous carbon nanosheets (CNs) can provide a channel for the transportation of Na+ and avoid the volume expansion during Na+ insertion and extraction process.

The hierarchical architecture is characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. The as-obtained MgMoO4 nanoplates showed a porous structure with a pore-size distribution ranging from 50 to 70 nm. This porosity provides an electron transport pathway and enhanced surface reaction kinetics. The binding energies measured for Mg 2p, Mo 3d, 3p and O 1s are consistent with the literature, and with the metal ions being present as M(ii) and M(vi) states, respectively. This indicates that the oxidation states of the metal cations are as expected. The electrochemical behaviour of MgMoO4 was investigated using aqueous (NaOH) and non-aqueous solvents (NaClO4 in EC : DMC : FEC) for supercapacitor and battery applications. The sodium-ion capacitor involves ion absorption and insertion into the MgMoO4 electrodes resulting in superior power and energy densities. However, the cycling stability was found to be stable only for an aqueous system. The formation of a solid electrolyte surface layer restricted the reversible capacity of the MgMoO4 in the sodium-battery. Nevertheless, it does offer some promise as an anode material for storing energy with high rate performance and excellent capacity retention. Detailed comparative analyses of various electrolytes in storage devices such as hybrid sodium-ion capacitors and sodium-ion batteries are vital for the integration of hierarchical structured materials into practical applications.

Importantly, this work is a first report for the sodium storage ability and related storage mechanism in oxalate compounds, specifically cobalt oxalate (CoC2O4) nanorods. The nanorods are intimately blended with acetylene black powders to achieve sufficient electrical conductivity (∼10-3 S cm-1). The resulting C-CoC2O4 electrode delivers an initial capacity of about 330 mA h (g-CoC2O4)-1 at a rate of 0.2 C (60 mA g-1) and preserves 75% of the initial capacity over 200 cycles. A high charge (oxidation) capacity, ∼111 mA h g-1, was achieved even at 30 C (9000 mA g-1). This remarkable electrode performance is reported for the first time for metal oxalate compounds tested for Na cells, to the best of our knowledge. X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy analyses lead to the proposal of a new sodium storage mechanism. For this mechanism, CoC2O4 is converted into Co metal involving with the creation of Na2C2O4 on discharge (reduction), and the Co metal is recovered to CoC2O4 on charge. The employed electroconducting carbon is likely to provide good electron conduction paths, which enables fast conversion on both discharge and charge. A full cell comprised of the C-CoC2O4 anode and carbon-coated NaCrO2 cathode exhibits good retention capacity over prolonged cycling, with retention of about 84.7% of the first capacity [107 mA h (g-NaCrO2)-1] for 300 cycles, and is active at a rate of 5 C (550 mA g-1), with a capacity of 79.5 mA h g-1. This result demonstrates the potential of applying C-CoC2O4 as an anode material for rechargeable SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) possesses high energy density but often suffers from poor electrical conductivity and limited cycling stability when used as a sodium‐ion battery (SIB) anode. To address these issues, the construction of （Molybdenum trioxide‐Molybdenum disulfide）MoO3‐MoS2 heterostructures has proven effective in enhancing electronic conductivity, ion diffusion properties, and structural stability. Guided by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which predict favorable Na+ diffusion and adsorption properties, nanorod‐like MoO3‐MoS2 heterostructures are synthesized using a two‐step method. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of the heterostructure and nanosized morphology, the resulting MoO3‐MoS2 electrode exhibits outstanding rate performance (316 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1) and long‐lasting cycling stability (286 mA h g−1 after 2300 cycles at 5 A g−1) as an SIB anode. In situ XRD measurements reveal that the ultrahigh specific capacity of MoO3‐MoS2 is attributed to the synergistic intercalation‐conversion storage of MoO3 and MoS2. In the pursuit of meeting commercialization requirements, electrodes with adjustable mass loading are also prepared using 3D printing, showcasing the high areal capacity characteristics of the SIBs. This study not only provides theoretical insights into expanding the use of heterojunction materials as SIB anodes but also demonstrates the significant potential for creating high‐energy‐density and cost‐effective SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Emerging sodium‐ion batteries (NIBs) and potassium‐ion batteries (KIBs) show promise in complementing lithium‐ion battery (LIB) technology and diversifying the battery market. Hard carbon is a potential anode candidate for LIBs, NIBs, and KIBs due to its high capacity, sustainability, wide availability, and stable physicochemical properties. Herein, a series of hard carbons is synthesized by hydrothermal carbonization and subsequent pyrolysis at different temperatures to finely tune their structural properties. When tested as anodes, the hard carbons exhibit differing ion‐storage trends for Li, Na, and K, with NIBs achieving the highest reversible capacity. Extensive materials and electrochemical characterizations are carried out to study the correlation of structural features with electrochemical performance and to explain the specific mechanisms of alkali‐ion storage in hard carbons. In addition, the best‐performing hard carbon is tested against a sodium cathode Na3V2(PO4)3 in a Na‐ion pouch cell, displaying a high power density of 2172 W kg−1 at an energy density of 181.5 Wh kg−1 (based on the total weight of active materials in both anode and cathode).

Practical deployment of NiCo2 S4 electrode in SIBs, however, is still hindered by the inferior capacity and unsatisfactory cycling performance, which result from the mismatch between the electrolyte chemistry and electrode. Herein, a functional electrolyte containing 1.0 m NaCF3 SO3 in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME) (1.0 m NaCF3 SO3 -DEGDME) is developed, which can be readily used for NiCo2 S4 anode with high initial coulomb efficiency (96.2%), enhanced cycling performance, and boosted capacities (341.7 mA h g-1 after 250 continuous cycles at the current density of 200 mA g-1 ). The electrochemical tests and related phase characterization combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicate the ether-based electrolyte is more suitable for the NiCo2 S4 anode in SIBs due to the formation of a stable electrode-electrolyte interface. Additionally, the importance of the voltage window is also demonstrated to further optimize the electrochemical performance of the NiCo2 S4 electrode. The formation of sulfide intermediates during charging and discharging is predicted by combining DFT and verified by in situ XRD and HRTEM. The findings indicate that electrolyte engineering would be an effective way of performance enhancement for sulfides in practical SIBs.",

The reaction between alcohol molecules and surface hydroxy groups is confirmed by density functional theory calculations and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.

The size of the TiO2 particles is controlled to ∼35-40 nm, with almost even distribution on the MWCNTs surface. The nanostructuring and appropriate doping of cost-effective manganese into the TiO2 host improved the electrochemical performance in terms of high rate capability and specific capacity for both the rechargeable battery systems. For the LIBs, the charge capacity of the 5% Mn-TiO2/MWCNT anode is 226.3 mA h g-1 in the first cycle, and is retained at 176.4 mA h g-1 after 80 cycles as compared with the SIBs, in which the charge capacity is 152.1 mA h g-1 in the first cycle, and is retained at 121.4 mA h g-1 after 80 cycles. After testing the electrodes at a high current rate of 20C, the nanocomposite electrode can still demonstrate charge capacities of 131.2 and 117.2 mA h g-1 at a 0.1C rate for LIBs and SIBs, respectively. The incorporation of Mn-ions (2+, 4+) is found to play a crucial role in terms of defects and vacancy creation, increasing conduction band electrons and lattice expansion to facilitate alkali metal ion diffusion for superior electrochemical performance. The combination of heteroatom doping and use of a highly conductive additive in the form of MWCNTs has resulted in excellent electrode integrity, high ion accessibility, and fast electron transport. Its outstanding cycling stability and remarkable rate performance make the 5% Mn-TiO2/MWCNT a promising anode material for high-performance LIBs and SIBs.",

However, low energy densities (˂ 100 Wh kg-1) due to the lack of high capacity (˃ 150 mAh g-1) anodes capable of fast-charging are delaying their practical implementation. Herein, we report a high-performance Na-ion hybrid capacitor based on interface engineered hierarchical TiO2 nanosheet anode consisting of bronze (~ 15%) and anatase (~ 85%) crystallites (~ 10 nm). This pseudocapacitive dual-phase anode demonstrated exceptional specific capacity of 289 mAh g-1@ 0.025 A g-1, and excellent rate capability (110 mAh g-1@ 1.0 A g-1). Na-ion hybrid capacitor integrating dual-phase hierarchical TiO2 nanosheet anode and activated carbon cathode exhibited a high energy density of 200 Wh kg-1 (based on the total mass of active materials in both electrodes) and power density of 6191 W kg-1. These values are in the energy and power density range of Li-ion batteries (100-300 Wh kg-1) and supercapacitors (5000-15000 W kg-1) respectively. Furthermore, exceptional capacity retention of 80% is observed after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. Outstanding electrochemical performance of the demonstrated Na-ion hybrid capacitor is credited to the enhanced pseudocapacitive Na-ion intercalation of two-dimensional TiO2 anode resulting from nanointerfaces between bronze and anatase crystallites. Mechanistic investigations evidenced Na-ion storage through intercalation pseudocapacitance with minimal structural changes.

Here, substantially boosted Na+ ion transport and charge transfer kinetics are demonstrated by constructing a near-ideal non-rectifying titanium carbonitride/nitrogen-doped TiO2 (TiCx N1- x /N-TiO2 ) heterostructure. Owing to the fast plasma effects and metastable hybrid phases, the TiCx N1- x is epitaxially grown on TiO2 . Energy band engineering at the interface induces high electron densities and a strong built-in electric field, which lowers the Na+ diffusion barrier by a factor of 1.7. As a result, the TiCx N1- x /N-TiO2 electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. The reversible specific capacities at rates of 0.1 and 10 C reach 312.3 and 173.7 mAh g-1 , respectively. After 600 cycles of charge and discharge at 10 C, the capacity retention rate is 98.7%.

However, the achievement of superior initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and high Na‐storage capacity via low‐temperature carbonization remains challenging due to the presence of tremendous defects with few closed pores. Here, a facile hybrid carbon framework design is proposed from the polystyrene precursor bearing distinct molecular bridges at a low pyrolysis temperature of 800°C via in situ fusion and embedding strategy. This is realized by integrating triazine‐ and carbonyl‐crosslinked polystyrene nanospheres during carbonization. The triazine crosslinking allows in situ fusion of spheres into layered carbon with low defects and abundant closed pores, which serves as a matrix for embedding the well‐retained carbon spheres with nanopores/defects derived from carbonyl crosslinking.

However, some long-standing and intractable obstacles, like low first coulombic efficiency (ICE), poor rate capability, storage capacity, and cycling stability, have severely hindered the conversion process from laboratory to commercialization.

Herein, constructing molybdenum-modified hard carbon solid spheres (Mo2C/HC-5.0), both the ion transfer kinetics, surface chemistry, and internal pseudo-graphitic carbon content are comprehensively improved. Specifically, Mo2C/HC-5.0 with higher pseudo-graphitic carbon content provides a large number of active sites and a more stable layer structure, resulting in improved sodium storage capacity, rate performance, and cycling stability. Moreover, the lower defect density and specific surface area of Mo2C/HC-5.0 further enhance ICE and sodium storage capacity. Consequently, the Mo2C/HC-5.0 anode achieves a high capacity of 410.7 mA h g-1 and an ICE of 83.9% at 50 mA g-1. Furthermore, the material exhibits exceptional rate capability and cycling stability, maintaining a capacity of 202.8 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1 and 214.9 mA h g-1 after 800 cycles at 1 A g-1.",

        "abstract": "Antimony (Sb) has been pursued as a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, it suffers from severe volume expansion during the sodiation-desodiation process. Encapsulating Sb into a carbon matrix can effectively buffer the volume change of Sb. However, the sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics in traditional carbon shells is still a bottleneck for achieving high-rate performance in Sb/C composite materials. Here we design and synthesize a yolk-shell Sb@Void@graphdiyne (GDY) nanobox (Sb@Void@GDY NB) anode for high-rate and long cycle life SIBs. The intrinsic in-plane cavities in GDY shells offer three-dimensional Na+ transporting channels, enabling fast Na+ diffusion through the GDY shells. Electrochemical kinetics analyses show that the Sb@Void@GDY NBs exhibit faster Na+ transport kinetics than traditional Sb@C NBs. In situ transmission electron microscopy analysis reveals that the hollow structure and the void space between Sb and GDY successfully accommodate the volume change of Sb during cycling, and the plastic GDY shell maintains the structural integrity of NBs. Benefiting from the above structural merits, the Sb@Void@GDY NBs exhibit excellent rate capability and extraordinary cycling stability.",

        "abstract": "Organic compounds have become a potentially important choice for a new generation of energy-storage electrode materials due to their designability, flexibility, green sustainability, and abundance. However, the applications of organic electrode materials are still limited because of their dissolution in electrolytes and low electrical conductivity, which in turn cause poor cycling stability. Here, for the first time, we report 2-amino-4-thiazole-acetic acid (ATA) and its sodium salt, sodium 2-amino-4-thiazol-derived polymer (PATANa), as an anode. The PATANa showed a two-dimensional (2D) nanosheet structure, offering a larger contact area with the electrolyte and a shorter ion-migration path, which improved the ion-diffusion kinetics. The polymer showed excellent cycling stability and outstanding rate capability when tested as an anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). It could deliver a high reversible specific capacity of 303 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 for 100 cycles and maintain a high discharge capacity of 190 mA h g-1 after 1000 long cycle numbers even at a high current density of 1000 mA g-1.

However, the design and development of highly efficient SIBs represent a great challenge. Here, a unique and reliable approach is reported to prepare carbon nitride (CN) hybridized with nickel iron sulfide (NFCN) using simple reaction between Ni-Fe layered double hydroxide and dithiooxamide. The characterization results demonstrate that the hybridization with optimal amount of CN induces local distortion in the crystal structure of the hybrid, which would benefit SIB performance. Systematic electrochemical studies with a half-cell configuration show that the present hybrid structure exhibits a promising reversible specific capacity of 348 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles with good rate capability. Simulation result reveals that the iron atoms in nickel iron sulfide act as a primary active site to accommodate Na+ ions. At last, with a full cell configuration using NFCN and Na3 V2 (PO4 )2 O2 F as the anode and cathode, respectively, the specific capacity appears to be ≈95 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 condition. This excellent performance of these hybrids can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the incorporated CN species and the high conductivity of nickel-iron sulfide.",

        "abstract": "Graphene/metal oxides (G/MO) composite materials have attracted much attention as the anode of sodium ion batteries (SIBs), because of the high theoretical capacity. However, most metal oxides operate based on the conversion mechanism and the alloying mechanism has changed to Na2O after the first cycle. The influence of G/Na2O (G/N) on the subsequent sodiation process has never been clearly elucidated. In this work, we report a systematic investigation on the G/N interface from both aspects of theoretical simulation and experiment characterization. By applied first-principles simulations, we find that the sluggish kinetics in the G/MO materials is mainly caused by the high diffusion barrier (0.51 eV) inside the Na2O bulk, while the G/N interface shows a much faster transport kinetics (0.25 eV) via unique double-interstitialcy mechanism. G/N interface possesses an interfacial storage of Na atom through the charge separation mechanism. The experimental evidence confirms that high interfacial ratio structure of G/N greatly improves the rate performance and endows G/MO materials the interfacial storage. Furthermore, the experimental investigation finds that the high interfacial ratio structure of G/N also benefits from the reversible reaction between SnO2 and Sn during cycling. Lastly, the effects of (N, O, S) doping in graphene systems at the G/N interface were also explored. This work provides a fundamental comprehension on the G/MO interface structure during the sodiation process, which is helpful to design energy storage materials with high rate performance and large capacity.",

Density functional theory and finite element analysis indicate that Sn/NaSn3 is the crucial phase transition highly responsible for inducing surface cracks, particle aggregations, and cell failures. Eliminating this phase transition by the control of cutoff voltages successfully extends the cycle life of μ-Sn to 2500 cycles at 2 A g-1, much longer than ∼40 cycles in a regular voltage window. The specific capacity is still retained at ∼455 mAh g-1, leading to a capacity decay of only ∼0.0088% per cycle.

Herein, a facile and green strategy for yolk-shell structure based on the principle of metal evaporation is proposed. SnS2 nanoparticle is encapsulated in nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanobox (SnS2 @C). The carbon nanoboxes accommodate the volume change and aggregation of SnS2 during cycling, and form 3D continuous conductive carbon matrix by close contact. The well-designed structure benefits greatly in conductivity and structural stability of the material. As expected, SnS2 @C exhibits considerable capacity, superior cycling stability, and excellent rate capability in both SIBs and PIBs. Additionally, in situ Raman technology is unprecedentedly conducted to investigate the phase evolution of polysulfides. This work provides an avenue for facilely constructing stable and high-capacity metal dichalcogenide based anodes materials with optimized structure engineering.

Herein, a conceive of nanoflowers, assembled with Bi2S3 nanorods, is demonstrated to construct the multiphase composition involving TiO2 coating and polypyrrole (PPy) encapsulation. Bi2S3 acted as the dominating active material, in consideration of the low content of TiO2, which ensured the high capacity of the composite. The dual-structural restrain of the TiO2 and PPy coatings can effectively alleviate volume variation based on the pseudo-\"zero-strain\" effect of TiO2 and high flexibility of PPy shells. Meanwhile, the heterointerface greatly enhanced the coupling effect between Bi2S3 and TiO2 and thus improved the electrochemical performance, which was proved by the results of density functional theory calculation and electrochemical tests. Combining the regulation from the Bi2S3/TiO2 heterojunction and the dual-structural restrain effect, the Bi2S3/TiO2@PPy electrode exhibited excellent rate performance and superior cycle stability (275.8 mA h g-1 over 500 cycles at 10 A g-1).

Custom-designed organic materials have been pursued as sustainable alternative electrodes for sodium-ion batteries, offering a solution that bypasses the need for traditional high-temperature synthesis. However, the challenge lies in achieving the desired electrochemical properties through precise structural modulation and the incorporation of redox-active functional groups. In this study, a triptycene-based microporous organic ladder polymer is developed featuring redox-active quinone moieties, designed as an anode material for high-performance sodium-ion batteries. The vertically aligned quinone moieties in the porous ladder polymer prevent the eclipsed stacking of layers, thereby enhancing the exposure of electroactive sites to electrolyte ions. Additionally, the ladder polymer exhibits almost unimodal pores due to its structural rigidity, facilitating fast Na+ ion diffusion. The redox-active quinone moieties host Na+ ions, and the microporosity supports capacitive ion storage. Consequently, a high reversible specific capacity of 316 mAh g-1 has been achieved.

Herein, a cooperative Na+‐solvation strategy is reported to stabilize the interphases by a holistic design of electrolytes combining soft and moderate co‐solvents. The rationally regulated Na+‐solvation leads to CEI/SEI with the desired thickness and component stability. As such, remarkable cycling stability is achieved for 4.3‐V Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) cathodes with 83.3% capacity retention over 3000 cycles at 1 C, significantly outperforming the carbonate counterpart (41.6% capacity retention). Meanwhile, the restrained SEI growth via reducing the formation of electron‐leaking Na2CO3 stabilizes the long‐term cycling of the hard carbon (HC) anode. The assembled NVOPF||HC full cells achieve superior rate capability (up to 15 C) and stable cycling stability over 500 cycles.

In this work, a composite (a-Si@rGO) consisting of porous amorphous silicon hollow nanoboxes (a-Si HNBs) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is prepared. The a-Si HNBs are synthesized through “sodiothermic reduction” of silica hollow nanoboxes at a relatively low temperature, and the rGO is covered on the surface of the a-Si HNBs by electrostatic interaction. The as-synthesized composite anode applying in SIBs exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 681.6 mAh g–1 at 100 mA g–1, great stability over 2000 cycles at 800 mA g–1, and superior rate performance (261.2, 176.8, 130.3, 98.4, and 73.3 mAh g–1 at 100, 400, 800, 1500, and 3000 mA g–1, respectively). The excellent electrochemical properties are ascribed to synergistic action of the porous hollow nanostructure of a-Si and the rGO coating.

        "title": "One-step Solid-State Synthesis of V1.13Se2/V2O3 Heterostructure as a High Pseudocapacitance Anode for Fast-Charging Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) offer several benefits, including cost-efficiency and fast-charging characteristics, positioning them as attractive substitutes for lithium-ion batteries in energy storage applications. However, the inferior capacity and cycling stability of electrodes in SIBs necessitate further enhancement due to sluggish reaction kinetics. In this respect, the utilization of heterostructures, which can provide an inherent electric field and abundant active sites on the surface, has emerged as a promising strategy for augmenting the cycling stability and rate features of the electrodes. This work delves into the utilization of V1.13Se2/V2O3 heterostructure materials as anodes, initially fabricated via a simplified one-step solid-state sintering technique. The high pseudocapacitance and low characteristic relaxation time constant give the V1.13Se2/V2O3 heterostructure impressive properties, such as a high capacity of 328.5 mAh g-1 even after 1500 cycles at a high current density of 2 A g-1 and rate capability of 278.9 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1. Moreover, the assembled sodium-ion full battery delivers a capacity of 118.5 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1. These findings provide novel insight and guidance for the rapid synthesis of heterojunction materials and the advancement of SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The development of sodium ion battery (SIBs) is hindered by the rapid reduction in reversible capacity of the carbon-based anode materials. The outside-in doping on carbon-based anode has been extensively explored. Whereas nickel and NiS2 particles embedded nitrogen and sulfur co-doped porous graphene can significantly improve the electrochemical performance, we report a build-in heteroatom \"self-doping\" on albumen derived graphene for sodium storage. The build-in sulfur and nitrogen in albumen act as the doping source during the carbonization of proteins. The S-rich proteins in the albumen can also guide the doping and nucleation of the nickel sulfide nanoparticles. Besides, the porous architecture of the carbonized proteins is achieved through the removable KCl/NaCl salts (medium) at high-temperature melting conditions. And during the carbonization process, the nitrogen can reduce the carbonization temperature of thermally stable carbon materials. In this work, the NS- grapheme delivered a specific capacity of 108.3 mAh g-1 after 800 cycles under a constant current density of 500 mA g-1, In contrast, the Ni/NiS2/NS-graphene maintained a specific capacity of 134.4 mAh g-1.

For the first time, we report a reliable hydrothermal method for the preparation of red phosphorus quantum dots (RPQDs) with commercial red P as a source. Moreover, an effective strategy was designed to fabricate RPQDs/rGO nanohybrids for addressing the intrinsic issues of red P as anode materials for SIBs. Benefiting from the nanostructuring of red P and the coupling of RPQDs with rGO, the obtained nanohybrids not only promote electron and ion transfer, but also effectively enhance the electronic conductivity, restrain the aggregation of RPQDs and buffer the large volume changes of red phosphorus during the charge-discharge process. The nanohybrids deliver an initial specific capacity of 1161 mA h g-1 and a low capacity deterioration rate of less than 0.12% per cycle even after 250 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g-1. The feasibility of large-scale production of the RPQDs/rGO nanohybrid, associated with its outstanding Na-ion storage properties and low cost, demonstrates that the RPQDs/rGO hybrid is a very promising anode material for SIBs.",

However, many challenges remain for development of SIBs with high specific capacity, high rate capability, and long cycle life. Therefore, CuS as an important earth-abundant, low-cost semiconductor was applied as anode of SIBs with ether-based electrolyte instead of conventional ester-based electrolyte. By incorporating reduced graphene oxide (RGO) into CuS nanosheets and optimizing the cutoff voltage, it is found that the sodium-ion storage performance can be greatly enhanced using ether-based electrolyte. The CuS-RGO composites deliver an initial Coulombic efficiency of 94% and a maximum specific capacity of 392.9 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g-1. And a specific capacity of 345 mAh g-1 is kept after 450 cycles at a current density of 1 A g-1. Such an excellent electrochemical performance is ascribed to the conductive network construction of CuS-RGO composites, the suppression of dissolved polysulfide intermediates by using ether-based electrolyte, and the avoidance of conversion-type reaction by optimizing the cutoff voltage.",

        "abstract": "The natural insulating property and notorious pulverization of volume variation-induced materials during cycling pares the electrochemical activity of red phosphorous (RP) for lithium/sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs). To work out these issues, a tailored trimodal porous carbon support comprising highly ordered macropores and micro-mesoporous walls embedded with copper (Cu) nanoclusters (Cu-OMC) is proposed to confine RP. The construction of highly conductive copper-carbon wall facilitates fast electrons and ions transportation, while the interconnected and ordered porous structure not only creates enough space to resist the expansion effect of RP but also minimizes the ion diffusion length and enhances ion accessibility (the ion migration coefficient is ten times that of disordered porous carbon). Consequently, the resulting Cu-OMC@RP anode delivers a high reversible capacity (2498.7 mAh g-1 at 0.3 C for LIBs; 2454.2 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C for SIBs), superb rate properties (824.7 mAh g-1 at 10 C for LIBs; 774.2 mAh g-1 at 5 C for SIBs), and outstanding cycling stability (an ultralow decay rate of 0.057% per cycle after 1000 cycles at 10 C for LIBs and 0.048% per cycle at 5 C over 500 cycles for SIBs).",

Uric acid (UA), a simple organic compound with three carbonyl groups is demonstrated to be electrochemically active in the insertion/extraction of Na ions. Theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations reveal that the sodium-ion storage by UA is a result of the stepwise mechanisms of p-π conjugation and the carbon anion. Aside from C═O, the functional group C═C(NH-)2 also provides an efficient Na-storage activated site in which the lone-pair electrons is stabilized through the planar-to-tetrahedral structural transition and low-energy orbital hybridization of N atoms. For further improvement of the electrochemical performance, a uric acid and carbon nanotube (UA@CNT) composite is prepared via a vacuum solution impregnation method. When employed as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries, the UA@CNT composite exhibits high specific capacity, excellent rate capability, and long cycling life even at high current densities. A reversible capacity of over 163 mA h g-1 is maintained even after 150 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g-1.

The synthesized cathode exhibited hexagonal, 2D platelets with an ∼300 nm thickness. During the anodic and cathodic sweeps, the cyclic voltammograms revealed multiple redox peaks with the same current densities, shapes, and peak positions, associated with the highly reversible phase transition mechanism of the layered P2-type NaCoO2 cathode. The sodium cells yielded the capacities of 93/92 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C and 87/87 mAh g-1 at 1 C for the 50th charge-discharge cycles. The in situ multimode calorimetry (MMC) studies of sodium cells demonstrated a thermal explosion event, which occurred by sodium melting, short-circuit, electrode decomposition reaction, gas generation, exothermic reaction, released heat energy ,and cell gasket melting. Ultimately, the calculated released total heat energies of ∼550/740 J g-1 for in situ MMC studies and ∼312/594 J g-1 for ex situ DSC analyses (charge state at 4 V and discharge state at 2 V) show that the discharged state of sodiated layered P2-type NaCoO2 cathode material is more unsafe than the charge state. Furthermore, the ex situ differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) spectrum of a discharge state at 2 V of layered P2-type NaCoO2 revealed a decreased onset temperature (DOT) at 141 °C with two pronounced exothermic peaks at 197 and 266 °C with a released higher total heat energy of 594 J g-1 than the charge state heat energy at 312 J g-1, attributed to the higher charge onset temperature (COT) at 191 °C. Thus, the observed higher heat energy and decreased onset temperature for the discharge state at 2 V is associated with the higher Na+ ion in the discharge state of the layered P2-type NaxCoO2 cathode than that of the pristine cathode, showcasing that the layered P2-type NaCoO2 cathode is unsafe at the discharged condition for sodium-ion batteries.",

Moreover, nitrogen doped in carbon is able to improve the electrochemical capability as well.

        "abstract": "Heteroatom doping is an effective method to improve the electrochemical properties of hard carbon anodes for sodium-ion batteries. However, the different roles of surface and bulk heteroatoms in Na storage have not been explored much. Herein, N, P dual-doped carbon nanofibers (NP-CNFs) with high doping contents and low surface area are designed to clarify the above issue. It is confirmed that P plays a more crucial role in Na storage compared with N. In addition, surface and bulk P not only possess different configurations but also show distinct Na storage activity. There are only oxidized POx groups on the surface, which are inactive for Na storage but promote the stability of electrochemistry interphase, while in the bulk phase, unoxidized P-C bonds also emerge except POx, which shows preeminently reversible Na storage activity, and the POx groups are activated simultaneously. Furthermore, P-doping changes the reactivity of N-configurations with Na both on the surface and in the bulk phase, exhibiting interesting synergism. As expected, the surface stability, bulk activity, and synergism enable NP-CNFs to achieve superior performance. It could deliver a prominent capacity of 105.6 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 after 3000 cycles in half cells and 164.3 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 200 cycles in full cells.",

        "abstract": "Biomass-derived hard carbon is a promising anode material for commercial sodium-ion batteries due to its low cost, high capacity, and stable cycling performance. However, the intrinsic tight lignocellulosic structure in biomass hinders the formation of sufficient closed pores, limiting the specific capacity of obtained hard carbons. In this contribution, a mild, industrially mature pretreatment method is utilized to selectively regulate biomass components. The hard carbon with a rich closed pore structure is prepared by optimizing the appropriate ratio of biomass composition. Optimized etching conditions enhanced the closed pore volume of hard carbon from 0.15 to 0.26 cm3 g-1. Consequently, the engineered hard carbon exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, including a high reversible capacity of 346 mAh g-1 with a high plateau capacity of 254 mAh g⁻¹ at 50 mA g⁻¹, robust rate capability, and cycling stability. The optimized hard carbon shows an 88 mAh g⁻¹ increase in plateau capacity compared to hard carbon from directly carbonizing bamboo fibers. This mature approach provides an easy-to-operate industrial pathway for designing high-capacity biomass-based hard carbons for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, all‐solid‐state batteries (ASSBs) with metal anodes have witnessed significant developments due to their high energy and power density as well as their excellent safety record. While intergranular dendritic lithium growth in inorganic solid electrolytes (SEs) has been extensively studied for lithium ASSBs, comparable knowledge is missing for sodium‐based ASSBs. Therefore, polycrystalline Na‐β″‐alumina is employed as a SE model material to investigate the microstructural influence on sodium filament growth during deposition of sodium metal at the anode. The research focuses on the relationship between the microstructure, in particular grain boundary (GB) type and orientation, sodium filament growth, and sodium ion transport, utilizing in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements in combination with crystal orientation analysis. The effect of the anisotropic sodium ion transport at/across GBs depending on the orientation of the sodium ion transport planes and the applied electric field on the current distribution and the position of sodium filament growth is explored. The in situ TEM analysis is validated by large field of view post‐mortem secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS) analysis, in which sodium filament growth within voids and along grain boundaries is observed, contributing to the sodium network formation potentially leading to failure of batteries.",

The synthesized MA-VA-PcNi polymer is used as the anode for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries, exhibiting excellent energy storage behaviors. The MA-VA-PcNi/Li battery displays a high capacity of 610 mA h g-1 and can still remain at 507 mA h g-1 with a retention rate of 83.1% after 400 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g-1. Even at a high current density of 2 A g-1, the specific capacity can remain at 195 mA h g-1. In addition, the MA-VA-PcNi/Na battery displays a high capacity of 336 mA h g-1 and can still remain at 278 mA h g-1 with a retention rate of 82.7% after 400 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g-1. A high specific capacity of 164 mA h g-1 can also be achieved at a high current density of 1 A g-1. After nickel phthalocyanine (PcNi) was grafted onto the MA-VA polymer, aggregation between phthalocyanine rings was effectively prevented, and this exposes more active sites. At the same time, the spherical particles obtained by electrospinning technology further improve the dispersion and increase the number of active sites of the active materials. Finally, the electrode materials show excellent energy storage behavior for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries, which provides a new idea for designing high-performance energy storage materials for organic electrodes.",

Herein, we report a durian-inspired design and template-free fabrication of a robust sodium electrode based on triangular pyramid arrays of Bi0.75Sb0.25 alloy electrodeposited on Cu substrates. The Bi0.75Sb0.25 arrays exhibit an appreciable electrochemical robustness for sodium storage, sustaining a reversible capability 335 mAh g-1 at a high rate of 2.5 A g-1, and 87% of the initial capacity over 2,000 cycles. We further demonstrate the applicability of the Bi0.75Sb0.25 array anode in sodium full cells by pairing it with a Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode. This full cell achieves a high specific energy of 203 Wh kg-1 (based on both active electrodes). Such an enhanced performance is attributed to the unique thorny-durian-like architecture and bimetallic alloy composition.

        "abstract": "Hard carbon is considered the most commercially viable anode material for sodium ion batteries due to its excellent sodium storage properties. However, the production cost of hard carbon is high, so optimizing the electrochemical performance of coal-derived hard carbon is adopted. However, due to the dense structure of coal, it is difficult to prepare closed pores inside the coal-derived hard carbon, which is not conducive to increasing capacity. Therefore, we propose Zn2(OH)2CO3 assisted ball milling pretreatment followed by carbonization to generate closed pores in coal-derived hard carbon. The reason for the formation of closed pores is that the uniform pores on the coal surface generated by the wear and etching of Zn2(OH)2CO3 are repaired at high temperatures. Via mechanism characterization, we verified that the plateau capacity is related to the filling of sodium ions in closed pores. Therefore, the as-prepared coal-derived hard carbon delivers a high capacity of 325.3 mA h g-1 (plateau capacity accounting for 45.1%) at a current density of 0.03 A g-1 with a capacity retention rate of 83.5% over 500 cycles. This work has demonstrated that reasonable pore design is an effective strategy to improve the electrochemical sodium storage performance of coal-derived hard carbon, providing an effective approach for the high value-added utilization of coal.",

        "abstract": "Na-ion batteries are promising alternatives to Li-ion systems for electrochemical energy storage because of the higher natural abundance and widespread distribution of Na compared to Li. High capacity anode materials, such as phosphorus, have been explored to realize Na-ion battery technologies that offer comparable performances to their Li-ion counterparts. While P anodes provide unparalleled capacities, the mechanism of sodiation and desodiation is not well-understood, limiting further optimization. Here, we use a combined experimental and theoretical approach to provide molecular-level insight into the (de)sodiation pathways in black P anodes for sodium-ion batteries. A determination of the P binding in these materials was achieved by comparing to structure models created via species swapping, ab initio random structure searching, and a genetic algorithm. During sodiation, analysis of 31P chemical shift anisotropies in NMR data reveals P helices and P at the end of chains as the primary structural components in amorphous Na xP phases. X-ray diffraction data in conjunction with variable field 23Na magic-angle spinning NMR support the formation of a new Na3P crystal structure (predicted using density-functional theory) on sodiation. During desodiation, P helices are re-formed in the amorphous intermediates, albeit with increased disorder, yet emphasizing the pervasive nature of this motif. The pristine material is not re-formed at the end of desodiation and may be linked to the irreversibility observed in the Na-P system.",

The instability of metal sulfides is caused by the large volume variation and sluggish reaction kinetics upon sodiation/desodiation. To overcome this, herein, a heterostructured nanocube anode composed of CuS/FeS2 embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon (CuS/FeS2 @NC) is synthesized. Size- and shape-controlled porous carbon nanocubes containing metallic nanoparticles are synthesized by the two-step pyrolysis of a bimetallic Prussian blue analog (PBA) precursor. The simple sulfurization-induced formation of highly conductive CuS along with FeS2 facilitates sodium-ion diffusion and enhances the redox reversibility upon cycling. The mesoporous carbon structure provides excellent electrolyte impregnation, efficient charge transport pathways, and good volume expansion buffering. The CuS/FeS2 @NC nanocube anode exhibits excellent sodium storage characteristics including high desodiation capacity (608 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 ), remarkable long-term cycle life (99.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 5 A g-1 ), and good rate capability up to 5 A g-1 .

However, their widespread use is hindered by their limited specific capacity.

It is observed that the length of the carbon chain in the precursor can effectively control the rearrangement behavior of the carbon layers during the high-temperature carbonization process, resulting in diverse pore structures ranging from closed pores to open pores, which significantly impact the electrochemical properties. The optimized hard carbon with abundant closed pores exhibits a high specific capacity of 356 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1, surpassing that of bare hard carbon (243 mAh g-1) and hard carbon with abundant open pores (129 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1). However, the kinetic analysis reveals that hard carbon with open pores shows better sodium-ion diffusion kinetics, indicating that a balance between the closed and open pores should be considered.

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted enormous attention in recent years due to the high abundance and low cost of sodium. However, in contrast to lithium‐ion batteries, conventional graphite is unsuitable for SIB anodes because it is much more difficult to intercolate the larger Na ions into graphite layers. Therefore, it is critical to develop new anode materials for SIBs for practical use. Here, heteroatom‐doped graphene with high doping levels and disordered structures is prepared using a simple and economical thermal process. The solvothermal‐derived graphene shows excellent performance as an anode material for SIBs. It exhibits a high reversible capacity of 380 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles at 100 mA g−1, excellent rate performance 217 mAh g−1 at 3200 mA g−1, and superior cycling performance at 2.0 A g−1 during 1000 cycles with negligible capacity fade.",

        "abstract": "Flexible sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have aroused great interest in energy storage devices. However, the choice of suitable anode materials is a key step in the application of SIBs. Here, a simple vacuum filtration method is reported to obtain a bimetallic heterojunction structure. The heterojunction exhibits better performance than any single-phase material in sodium storage. The results show that the electron rich Se site and the internal electric field generated by the electron transfer in the heterojunction structure can provide rich electrochemically active areas and effectively promote the electron transport during sodiation/desodiation. More attractively, the strong interfacial interaction in the interface on the one hand maintains the stability of the structure and on the other hand promotes the diffusion of electrons. The NiCoSex/CG heterojunction with a strong oxygen bridge exhibits a high reversible capacity of 338 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, and an ignorable capacity attenuation at 2 A g-1 for 2000 cycles. The flexible full battery still shows good reversibility and output stability under bending and crimping. This idea of obtaining high-performance anodes by designing a heterojunction structure and constructing an oxygen bridge can provide a new vision for the design of other materials.",

        "abstract": "Fe2 O3 is regarded as a promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high specific capacity. The large volume change during discharge and charge processes, however, induces significant cracking of the Fe2 O3 anodes, leading to rapid fading of the capacity. Herein, a novel peapod-like nanostructured material, consisting of Fe2 O3 nanoparticles homogeneously encapsulated in the hollow interior of N-doped porous carbon nanofibers, as a high-performance anode material is reported. The distinctive structure not only provides enough voids to accommodate the volume expansion of the pea-like Fe2 O3 nanoparticles but also offers a continuous conducting framework for electron transport and accessible nanoporous channels for fast diffusion and transport of Li/Na-ions. As a consequence, this peapod-like structure exhibits a stable discharge capacity of 1434 mAh g-1 (at 100 mA g-1 ) and 806 mAh g-1 (at 200 mA g-1 ) over 100 cycles as anode materials for LIBs and SIBs, respectively. More importantly, a stable capacity of 958 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles and 396 mAh g-1 after 1500 cycles can be achieved for LIBs and SIBs, respectively, at a large current density of 2000 mA g-1 .

Second, electrophoretic deposition is used as a tool to assemble these building blocks into macroscopic films containing these self-assembled 2D heterostructures. Characterization of deposits formed using this technique elucidates the presence of stacked and sandwiched 2D heterostructures, and zeta potential measurements confirm the mechanistic interactions driving this assembly. Building on the exceptional sodium alloying capacity of BP, these materials were demonstrated as superior binder-free and additive-free anodes for sodium batteries with specific discharge capacity of 2365 mA h gP-1 and long stable cycling duration. This study demonstrates how controllable co-processing of 2D materials can enable material control for stacking and building block assembly relevant to broad future applications of 2D materials.",

The application has been also studied for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). The finely crystallized CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (around 5 nm in size) are uniformly grown on the PPy nanotubes. When tested as anode materials for SIBs, the CFO-PPy-NT electrode maintains a discharge capacity of 400 mA h g-1 and a stable Coulombic efficiency of 98% after 200 cycles at 100 mA g-1. Even at a higher current density of 1000 mA g-1, the composite can still retain a discharge capacity of 220 mA h g-1 after 2000 cycles. The superior electrochemical performance could be mainly ascribed to the uniform distribution of CoFe2O4 on the 3-D matrix of PPy interconnected nanotubes, which favors the diffusion of sodium ions and electronic transportation and also buffers the large volumetric expansion during charge/discharge. Thereby our study suggests that such CFO-PPy-NTs have great potential as an anode material for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have attracted considerable attention in recent years. In order to promote the practical application of sodium-ion batteries, the electrochemical performances, such as specific capacity, reversibility, and rate capability of the anode materials, should be further improved. In this work, a Fe2O3/C composite with a well-ordered mesoporous structure is prepared via a facile co-impregnation method by using mesoporous silica SBA-15 as a hard template. When used as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries, the well-ordered mesoporous structure ensures fast mass transport kinetics. The presence of nano-sized Fe2O3 particles confined within the carbon walls significantly enhances the specific capacity of the composite. The carbon walls in the composite act not only as an active material contributing to the specific capacity, but also as a conductive matrix improving the cycling stability of Fe2O3 nanoparticles. As a result, the well-ordered mesoporous Fe2O3/C composite exhibits high specific capacity, excellent cycleability, and high rate capability. It is proposed that this simple co-impregnation method is applicable for the preparation of well-ordered mesoporous transition oxide/carbon composite electrode materials for high performance sodium-ion and lithium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) has been regarded as a favorable cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high voltage and stable structure. However, the limited electronic conductivity restricts its rate performance. NVPF@reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was synthesized by a facile microwave-assisted hydrothermal approach with subsequent calcination to shorten the hydrothermal time. NVPF nanocuboids with sizes of 50-150 nm distributed on rGO can be obtained, delivering excellent electrochemical performance such as a longevity life (a high capacity retention of 85.6% after 7000 cycles at 10 C) and distinguished rate capability (116 mAh g-1 at 50 C with a short discharging/charging time of 1.2 min). The full battery with a Cu2Se anode represents a capacity of 116 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1. The introduction of rGO can augment the electronic conductivity and advance the Na+ diffusion speed, boosting the cycling and rate capability. Besides, the small lattice change (3.3%) and high structural reversibility during the phase transition process between Na3V2(PO4)2F3 and NaV2(PO4)2F3 testified by in situ X-ray diffraction are also advantageous for Na storage behavior.

On account of the high reduction activity of sodium metal with organic solvents, it is very important to optimize the electrolyte component to realize high stability on Na metal and hard carbon anodes. Herein, chemical and electrochemical stability of propylene carbonate (PC)-based electrolytes on sodium metal and hard carbon anodes is investigated systematically. The results demonstrate that whether using NaClO4 or NaPF6, the PC-based electrolytes are not stable on Na metal, but adding of FEC can immensely enhance the stability of the electrolyte because of the compact solid electrolyte interphase film formed. The electrolytes containing FEC also exhibit high electrochemical compatibility on hard carbon anodes, showing high reversible capacity and excellent cycling performance. A reaction mechanism based on the Na+ induction effect is proposed by spectrum and electrochemical measurements. This study can provide a new insight to optimize and develop stable PC-based electrolytes and be helpful for understanding the other electrolyte systems.",

Here, from self-assembled cellulose nanocrystal sheets with crystallographic texture, unique HC nanosheets with vertically oriented (002) planes are fabricated and used as a model HC to investigate the sodiation mechanisms using synchrotron scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) coupled with analytical transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The model HC simplifies the 3D sodiation in a typical HC particle into a 2D sodiation, which facilitates the visualization of phase transformation at different states of charge. The results for the first time unveil that the sodiation in HC initiates heterogeneously, with multiple propagation fronts proceeding simultaneously, eventually merging into larger aggregates. The spatial correlation between the preferential adsorption and nucleation sites suggests that the heterogeneous nucleation is driven by the local Na-ion concentration, which is determined by defects or heteroatoms that have strong binding to Na ions. By identifying intercalation as the dominant sodium storage mechanism in the model HC, the findings highlight the importance of engineering the graphene layer orientation and the structural heterogeneity of edge sites to enhance the performances.",

Herein, we elaborately designed stable Sb-doped metallic 1T phase molybdenum sulfide (1T-MoS2-Sb) with a few-layered nanosheet structure via a simple calcination technique. The N-doping of the carbon and Sb-doping induce the formation of T-phase MoS2, which not only effectively enhances the entire stability of the structure, but also improves its cycling performance and stability. When employed as an anode of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), 1T-MoS2-Sb exhibits a reversible capacity of 493 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles and delivers prominent long-term performance (253 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 2200 cycles) along with decent rate capability. Paired with a Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, it displays a superior capacity of 242 mA h g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 over 100 cycles, which is one of the best performances of a MoS2-based full cell for SIBs. Employed as the anode for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs), it exhibits a satisfactory specific capacity of 343 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles. This facile strategy will provide new insights for designing T-phase advanced anode materials for SIBs/PIBs.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal selenides (TMSs) are receiving considerable interest as improved anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their considerable theoretical capacity and excellent redox reversibility. Herein, ZIF-12 (zeolitic imidazolate framework) structure is used for the synthesis of Cu2Se/Co3Se4@NPC anode material by pyrolysis of ZIF-12/Se mixture. When Cu2Se/Co3Se4@NPC composite is utilized as an anode electrode material in LIB and SIB half cells, the material demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance and remarkable cycle stability with retaining high capacities. In LIB and SIB half cells, the Cu2Se/Co3Se4@NPC anode material shows the ultralong lifespan at 2000 mAg-1, retaining a capacity of 543 mAhg-1 after 750 cycles, and retaining a capacity of 251 mAhg-1 after 200 cycles at 100 mAg-1, respectively. The porous structure of the Cu2Se/Co3Se4@NPC anode material can not only effectively tolerate the volume expansion of the electrode during discharging and charging, but also facilitate the penetration of electrolyte and efficiently prevents the clustering of active particles. In situ X-ray difraction (XRD) analysis results reveal the high potential of Cu2Se/Co3Se4@NPC composite in building efficient LIBs and SIBs due to reversible conversion reactions of Cu2Se/Co3Se4@NPC for lithium-ion and sodium-ion storage.",

However, the integration of such two type materials and the relevant sodium storage applications remain daunting challenges. Here, an ingenious diatomite‐templated synthetic strategy is designed to fabricate single‐atom cobalt‐doped MoS2/carbon (SA Co‐MoS2/C) composites toward the high‐performance sodium storage. Benefiting from the unique hierarchical structure, high electron/sodium‐ion conductivity, and abundant active sites, the obtained SA Co‐MoS2/C reveals remarkable specific capacity (≈604.0 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1), high rate performance, and outstanding long cyclic stability. Particularly, the sodium‐ion full cell composed of SA Co‐MoS2/C anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode demonstrates unexpected stability with the cycle number exceeded 1200. The internal sodium storage mechanism is clarified with the aid of density functional theory calculations and in situ experimental characterizations.

MXenes, as one of the most promising anodes for sodium-ion batteries, have been reported to have many advantages, such as high electronic conductivity and a hydrophilic surface. However, the compact multilayer structure and deficient delamination significantly inhibits their application, requiring high energy and showing decreased storage capacity and poor rate capabilities. Few-layer MXene has been proved to benefit superior electrochemical properties with a better ionic conductivity and two-dimensional layer structure. Herein, we report scale delamination of few-layer MXene nanosheets as anodes for sodium-ion batteries, which are prepared via an organic solvent assist high-energy mechanical-milling method. This approach efficiently prevents the oxidation of MXene and produces few-layer nanosheets structure, facilitating fast electron transport and Na+ diffusion. Electrochemical tests demonstrate that the few-layer MXenes show high specific capacity, excellent cycle stability, and good rate performance. Specifically, few-layer MXene nanosheets deliver a high reversible capacity of 267 mA h g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1. After cycling 1500 cycles at a high rate of 1 A g-1, a reversible capacity of 76 mA h g-1 could be maintained.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are recognized as promising energy storage devices. However, they suffer from rapid capacity decay at ultra-low temperatures due to high Na+ desolvation energy barrier and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, a weakly solvating electrolyte (WSE) with decreased ion-dipole interactions is designed for stable sodium storage in hard carbon (HC) anode at ultra-low temperatures. 2-methyltetrahydrofuran with low solvating power is incorporated into tetrahydrofuran to regulate the interactions between Na+ and solvents. The reduced Na+-dipole interactions facilitate more anionic coordination in the first solvation sheath, which consistently maintains anion-enhanced solvation structures from room to low temperatures to promote inorganic-rich SEI formation. These enable WSE with a low freezing point of -83.3°C and faster Na+ desolvation kinetics. The HC anode thus affords reversible capacities of 243.2 and 205.4 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 at -40 and -60°C, respectively, and the full cell of HC||Na3V2(PO4)3 yields an extended lifespan over 250 cycles with high capacity retention of ~100% at -40°C.

The co-existence of two alkali metals in an anode raises a question: whether the liquid Na-K alloy acts as a Na or a K anode. Here we show the alkali-metal that is stripped from the liquid Na-K anode is dependent on the preference of the cathode host. It acts as the anode of a sodium rechargeable cell if the cathode host structure selectively accepts only Na+ ions; as the anode of a potassium rechargeable cell if the cathode accepts K+ ions in preference to Na+ ions. This dual-anode behavior means the liquid Na-K alkali-alloy can be applied as a dendrite-free anode in Na-metal batteries as well as K-metal batteries.",

Designing a 3D confinement scaffold is a promising strategy for constructing dendrite‐free sodium‐metal anodes; however, cycling stability at a large current density (>10 mA cm−2) is still difficult to realize. Herein, the design of new lightweight and fibrous hydroxylated Ti3C2 (h‐Ti3C2) MXene based scaffolds with stepped sodiophilic gradient structure (h‐M‐SSG) is reported, and its thickness can be controlled (80−250 µm). The sodiophilic gradient structure (adjusted by h‐Ti3C2) can effectively induce sodium ions to preferentially deposit at the bottom of the scaffold, thus inhibiting dendrite growth. h‐M‐SSG/Na‐based symmetrical batteries exhibit a low polarization voltage and long cycling life at a high current density (40 mA cm−2) and a high cut‐off capacity (40 mAh cm−2). Moreover, a Na–O2 battery with an h‐M‐SSG/Na anode exhibits a low potential gap of 0.137 V after 45 cycles at 1000 mA g−1 and 1000 mAh g−1.

To address these issues, herein, SnO2 quantum dots (≈5 nm) embedded in porous N-doped carbon matrix (SnO2 /NC) are developed via a hydrothermal step combined with a self-polymerization process at room temperature. The ultrasmall size in quantum dots can greatly shorten the ion diffusion distance and lower the internal strain, improving the conversion reaction efficiency and coulombic efficiency. The rich mesopores/micropores and highly conductive N-doped carbon matrix can further enhance the overall conductivity and buffer effect of the composite. As a result, the optimized SnO2 /NC-2 composite for LIBs exhibits a high coulombic efficiency of 72.9%, a high discharge capacity of 1255.2 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles and a long life-span with a capacity of 753 mAh g-1 after 1500 cycles at 1 A g-1 .

Mn-based layer-tunnel hybrid composite became a focus in sodium ion batteries due to the supe-riority in high performance, low cost and non-toxicity. In the previous reports, the structure modulation was car-ried out via changing the synthesis condition, varying the transition metal element ratio, and different ion doping. And it is still challenging to explore a more feasible method to simplify the adjustment process. Herein, we intro-duced Mg2+ into Na sites or transition metal sites in Na0.6MnO2 and firstly discovered the doping-sites variation induced structure adjustment phenomenon. Specifically, Mg doping in transition metal sites could be beneficial for the growth of the P2-type structure while layer/tunnel component ratio decreased when locating Mg2+ in Na sites. The P2-O2 phase transformations could be effectively suppressed by locating Mg2+ in both sites could the in high voltage regions and thus improve cycling performance. The designed material, Na0.6Mn0.99Mg0.01O2, could attain a decent capacity of 100 mA h g-1 at 1000 mA g-1 and a satisfied retention of 76.6 % after 500 cycles. Ad-ditionally, ex situ XRD experiments verify the excellent structural stability of Mg-substituted samples during charge-discharge processes. Moreover, the Na0.6Mn0.99Mg0.01O2 also displays superior sodium-ion full-cell proper-ties when merged with hard carbon anode. Thus, this research may indicate a proper novel thread for designing high-performance composite electrodes.",

However, small molecular organic materials suffer from issues such as low conductivity and the high dissolution rate in electrolytes. Herein, a phthalocyanine derivative (TPcDS) with a large non-localized π-electron system, obtained through thermodynamic polymerization of 4-aminophthalonitrile (AP) monomers, is designed to address these issues. According to the density function theory calculation, six sodium ions can be attracted by one polymer molecule, indicating a high theoretical capacity of 375 mA h g-1 . The TPcDS molecule realizes sodium storage through a non-localized π-electron system of phthalocyanine macrocycles. When employed as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries, the functional groups of phthalocyanine macrocycles, such as CN groups in TPcDS, experience obviously reversible structural variation upon discharge/charge. A high reversible capacity of 364 mAh g-1 is achieved at a current density of 0.05 A g-1 , and a charge capacity of as high as 246 mAh g-1 is still maintained after 500 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 .

        "abstract": "Highly crystalline CuFeS2 containing earth-abundant and environmentally friendly elements prepared via a high-temperature synthesis exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance as an anode material in sodium-ion batteries. The initial specific capacity of 460 mAh g-1 increases to 512 mAh g-1 in the 150th cycle and then decreases to a still very high value of 444 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 in the remaining 550 cycles. Even for a large current density, a pronounced cycling stability is observed. Here, we demonstrate that combining the results of X-ray powder diffraction experiments, pair distribution function analysis, and 23Na NMR and Mössbauer spectroscopy investigations performed at different stages of discharging and charging processes allows elucidation of very complex reaction mechanisms. In the first step after uptake of 1 Na/CuFeS2, nanocrystalline NaCuFeS2 is formed as an intermediate phase, which surprisingly could be recovered during charging. On increasing the Na content, Cu+ is reduced to nanocrystalline Cu, while nanocrystalline Na2S and nanosized elemental Fe are formed in the discharged state. After charging, the main crystalline phase is NaCuFeS2. At the 150th cycle, the mechanisms clearly changed, and in the charged state, nanocrystalline CuxS phases are observed. At later stages of cycling, the mechanisms are altered again: NaF, Cu2S, and Cu7.2S4 appeared in the discharged state, while NaF and Cu5FeS4 are observed in the charged state. In contrast to a typical conversion reaction, nanocrystalline phases play the dominant role, which are responsible for the high reversible capacity and long-term stability.",

        "abstract": "To achieve high‐quality hard carbon nanofibers (HCNFs), and particularly flexible HCNFs films is the eternal pursuit from low‐cost coal pitch (CP). However, it is still trapped seriously by the inborn bottleneck of low‐softening‐point (LSP) characteristics of CP itself. Herein, an efficient Bi(NO3)3·5H2O‐assisted electrospinning‐carbonization methodology is creatively devised to obtain flexible HCNFs films directly from LSP CP. The essential roles of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and pre‐oxidation in constructing flexible films are rationally proposed. With further regulation in Bi(NO3)3·5H2O dosage and calcination temperatures, specific micro‐structures/morphologies of flexible HCNFs films are finely optimized. The optimum HCNFs‐1.2 film is endowed with robust structural flexibility/stability, high‐content active oxygen/nitrogen groups, abundant graphic microcrystalline zones of large interlayer spacing, and convenient ion‐diffusion channels. Thanks to such remarkable merits, HCNFs‐1.2 retains a large reversible capacity of 125.3 mAh g‒1 over 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g‒1, when evaluated as a self‐supporting film anode for sodium dual‐ion batteries (SDIBs). Furthermore, the HCNFs‐1.2‐based SDIBs deliver a specific capacity of 90.9 mAh g‒1 at 0.1 A g‒1, along with a capacity retention of 78.4% after 1500 cycles at 1.0 A g‒1. The insightful understanding here will provide meaningful guidance for rational design of advanced flexible film electrodes toward next‐generation SDIBs and beyond.",

        "abstract": "Recently, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have received considerable attention for large-scale energy storage applications. However, the low initial Coulombic efficiency of traditional SIBs severely impedes their further development. Here, a highly active Na2 S-based composite is employed as a self-sacrificial additive for sodium compensation in SIBs. The in situ synthesized Na2 S is wrapped in a carbon matrix with nanoscale particle size and good electrical conductivity, which helps it to achieve a significantly enhanced electrochemical activity as compare to commercial Na2 S. As a highly efficient presodiation additive, the proposed Na2 S/C composite can reach an initial charge capacity of 407 mAh g-1 . When 10 wt.% Na2 S/C additive is dispersed in the Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 cathode, and combined with a hard carbon anode, the full cell achieves 24.3% higher first discharge capacity, which corresponds to a 18.3% increase in the energy density from 117.2 to 138.6 Wh kg-1 . Meanwhile, it is found that the Na2 S additive does not generate additional gas during the initial charging process, and under an appropriate content, its reaction product has no adverse impact on the cycling stability and rate performance of SIBs. Overall, this work establishes Na2 S as a highly effective additive for the construction of advanced high-energy-density SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, the extended usage of lithium/sodium ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs) encounters nerve-wracking issues, including a lack of suitable reservoirs and high thermal runaway hazards. Although using TiO2 and Li4Ti5O12 has been confirmed to be effective in improving battery safety, their low theoretical capacities inevitably cause damage to the electrochemical performance of the battery. Achieving win-win results has become an urgent necessity. This study designed a metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived in situ carbon-coated metal selenide (Ni-Se@G@C) as the anode. When the current density is 0.1-0.3 A g-1, the initial capacity of LIBs reaches 993.2 mAh g-1, which increases to 1478.9 mAh g-1 after running 800 cycles. When running at 2 A g-1, the cell also offers a relatively high capacity of 458.3 mAh g-1 after 1500 cycles. After the replacement of graphite with Ni-Se@G@C, the self-heating temperature (T0) and thermal runaway triggering temperature (T1) of half and full cells are significantly increased. Meanwhile, the maximum thermal runaway temperature (T2) and maximal heating release rate (HRRmax) are significantly reduced. Of note, the usage of Ni-Se@G@C enables the battery with superior cycling and rate performance. When used in SIBs, the cell gives an initial discharge capacity of 624.9 mAh g-1, which still remains at 269.4 mAh g-1 after running 200 cycles at 1 A g-1. Notably, Ea of the Ni-Se@G@C cell is 5.6 times higher than that of the graphite cell, corroborating the promoted safety performance. This work provides a new paradigm for MOF-derived micro/nanostructures, enabling the battery with an excellent electrochemical and safety performance portfolio.",

Herein, Na3.5V1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 (NVFP) is designed by an Fe‐substitution strategy, which not only reduces the exorbitant cost of vanadium, but also realizes high‐voltage multielectron reactions. The NVFP cathode can deliver extraordinary capacity (148.2 mAh g−1), and decent cycling durability up to 84% after 10 000 cycles at 100 C. In situ X‐ray diffraction and ex situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations reveal reversible structural evolution and redox processes (Fe2+/Fe3+, V3+/V4+, and V4+/V5+) during electrochemical reactions. The low ionic‐migration energy barrier and ideal Na+‐diffusion kinetics are elucidated by density functional theory calculations. Combined with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fe with unpaired electrons in the 3d orbital is inseparable from the higher‐valence redox activation. More competitively, coupling with a hard carbon (HC) anode, HC//NVFP full cells demonstrate high‐rate capability and long‐duration cycling lifespan (3000 stable cycles at 50 C), along with material‐level energy density up to 304 Wh kg−1.

However, the application of MoS2 is restricted by the poor electrical conductivity and sluggish ion diffusion. Herein, hollow nanotubes constructed with highly conductive 1T phase MoS2 nanosheets and polypyrrole (PPy) nanotubes are fabricated and used as anode materials for lithium‐ion batteries and sodium‐ion batteries. Remarkably, these hollow nanotubes show a high lithium‐specific capacity of 755.5 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and excellent sodium‐specific capacity of 503.3 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles. The enhanced electrochemical performance can be attributed to the rational design of unique 1D and 2D composite structure. First, the highly conductive 1T phase MoS2 2D nanosheets and hollow 1D PPy nanotube can effectively promote the charge transfer kinetics. However, the increased interlayer spacing of 1T phase MoS2 rapidly improves the insertion/extraction process of metal ions, and the vertical growth of MoS2 nanosheets on the surface of the PPy nanotubes also exposes more energy storage sites.

The reflux-synthesized hybrid shows a well-overlapped 2D structure, while the solvothermally prepared hybrid forms a segregated phase in which the contact area between the CONs and GNs is reduced. These two hybrids synthesized by facile methods are fully characterized, and the results reveal that their energy-storage properties can be significantly improved by enhancing the electrical conductivity via the formation of a well-overlapped structure between CONs and GNs. The discharge capacity and rate capability of the reflux-synthesized hybrid was considerably larger than that of the bare CONs, highlighting that the improvement in the charge-carrier transport properties can improve the accessibility of Na ions to the surface of the hybrids. This synthetic methodology can be extended to the fabrication of high-performance anodes for Na-ion batteries.",

Yet, they face the dilemma of worsening the parasitic reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface and low packing density for the fabrication of practical electrodes. Here, pomegranate Sb@C yolk-shell microspheres were developed as a high-performance anode for LIBs and SIBs with controlled interfacial properties and enhanced packing density. Although the same yolk-shell nanostructure (primary particle size, porosity) and three-dimensional architecture alleviated the volume change induced stress and swelling in both batteries, the SIBs show 99% capacity retention over 200 cycles, much better than the 78% capacity retention of the LIBs. The comparative electrochemical study and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterization revealed that the different SEIs, besides the distinct phase transition mechanism, played a critical role in the divergent cycling performance.",

        "abstract": "Iron sulfides with high theoretical capacity confront the challenges of low rate capability and severe capacity fading for sodium storage, which are mainly caused by poor electron/ion transport kinetics and drastic volume fluctuations during cycling. Herein, to mitigate these obstacles, a multi-step synthetic tactic involving solvothermal, carbonization, and subsequent sulfurization is put forward for the construction of wire-like structure by confining Fe7S8 particles in porous N-doped carbon framework (denoted as Fe7S8/PNC) using zinc iron nitrilotriacetate as template. By partially substituting Fe3+ with Zn2+ in the metal coordination complex, the porous structure of coordination complex derived carbon framework can be regulated through pore structure engineering of Zn nanodroplets. The desired porous and robust core/shell structure can not only afford favorable electron/Na+ transport paths and additional active sites for Na+ storage, but also provide reinforced structural integrity of interior Fe7S8 particles by retarding the pulverization and buffering the mechanical stress against volume fluctuations. As anode for sodium-ion batteries, the optimal Fe7S8/PNC delivers a high reversible capacity (743 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), superior rate capability (553 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1), and long-term cycling stability (602 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 with 98.5% retention after 1000 cycles).",

In this study, a precursor of Co1-xS with a uniform and hollow nanospherical architecture is obtained with a high yield via a mild solvothermal method in the presence of 2-methylimidazole at first. Then, Co1-xS, Co1-xS/C (ultrafine Co1-xS nanoparticles embedded in the shells of the nitrogen-doped porous carbon hollow nanosphere), and Co1-xS@C (Co1-xS nanoparticles entirely covered by an external amorphous carbon layer) were selectively fabricated via direct calcination or PPy coating & calcination of the obtained precursor. Co1-xS/C shows best electrochemical performance than the other two materials as anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Besides the excellent rate performance, a high reversible discharge capacity of 320 mA g-1 can be retained after 130 cycles at 1 A g-1. The impressive performance may be attributed to the unique structure, higher conductivity, and more active sites of Co1-xS/C. In addition, 559 mA h g-1 was maintained after 100 cycles at 500 mA g-1 when the Co1-xS/C composite was applied as an anode in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenide materials show potential for use in alkali metal ion batteries owing to their remarkable physical and chemical properties. Nevertheless, the electrochemical energy storage performance is still impaired by the tendency of aggregation, volume, and morphological change during the conversion reaction and poor intrinsic conductivity. Until now, ultrathin molybdenum disulfide nanosheets with a metallic-phase structure on the inner surface of mesoporous hollow carbon spheres (M-MoS2@HCS) have rarely been investigated as an anode for sodium-ion batteries. In this work, a novel M-MoS2@HCS anode was designed and synthesized by employing a template-assisted solvothermal reaction. Structural and chemical analyses indicate that the M-MoS2 nanosheets with a larger interlayer spacing compared to their semiconductor counterpart grow on the inner surface of HCS via covalent interactions. When used as the anode materials for Na+ storage, the M-MoS2@HCS anode presents durable and rapid sodium storage properties. The developed electrode shows a reversible capacity of 291.2 mAh g-1 at a high current density of 5 A g-1. After 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1, the reversible capacity is 401.3 mAh g-1 with a capacity retention rate of 79%. After 2500 cycles at 1.0 A g-1, the electrode still delivers a reversible capacity of 320.1 mAh g-1 with a capacity retention rate of 75%. The excellent sodium storage capability of the MoS2@HCS electrode is explained by the special structural design, which reveals great potential to accelerate the practical applications of transition-metal dichalcogenide electrodes for sodium storage.",

Transmission electron microscopy images showed that Nb2O5 NCs with average particle size of 3 nm were uniformly deposited on rGO sheets and voids among Nb2O5 NCs existed. The architecture of ultrafine Nb2O5 NCs anchored on a highly conductive rGO network can not only enhance charge transfer and buffer the volume change during sodiation/desodiation process but also provide more active surface area for sodium ion storage, resulting in superior rate and cycle performance. Ex situ XPS analysis revealed that the sodium ion storage mechanism in Nb2O5 could be accompanied by Nb(5+)/Nb(4+) redox reaction and the ultrafine Nb2O5 NCs provide more surface area to accomplish the redox reaction.",

Herein, we design a synergistic strategy of dual doping via the in situ doping and hydrogenation treatment to improve conductivity and cycling stability of TiO2. Experiments and theoretical calculations together revealed that N and C doping reduces the band gap of TiO2, while the presence of oxygen vacancies efficiently accelerates the diffusion of sodium ions. Thus N, C, and oxygen vacancies with high concentration co-doped TiO2, resulting in extraordinary high-rate performance, significant stable cycling, and long-term cyclability of up to 10,000 cycles. The synthesis strategy of dual doping proposed here emphasizes the importance of defect engineering in improving material conductivity and electrode cycling stability for possible practical applications in the near future.",

        "abstract": "Intimately coupled carbon/transition‐metal‐based hierarchical nanostructures are one of most interesting electrode materials for boosting energy conversion and storage applications owing to the strong synergistic effect between the two components and appealing structural stability. Herein, a universal method is reported for making hierarchical hollow carbon nanospheres (HCSs) with intimately coupled ultrathin carbon nanosheets and Mo‐based nanocrystals. The in situ and confined reaction of the synthetic strategy can not only allow the aggregation of the nanocrystals to be impeded, but also endows extremely intimate coupled interaction between the conductive carbon nanosheets and the nanocrystals MoM (M = P, S, C and O). As a proof of concept, the as‐prepared MoP/C HCSs exhibit extraordinary hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalytic activity with small overpotential and robust durability in both acidic and alkaline solutions. In addition, the unique sheet‐on‐sheet MoS2/C HCSs as an anode demonstrate high capacity, great rate capabilities, and long‐term cycles for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). The capacity can be maintained at 410 mA h g−1 even after 1000 cycles even at a high current density of 4 A g−1, one of the best reported values for MoS2‐based electrode materials for SIBs.

        "title": "Tailoring the surface chemistry of hard carbon towards high-efficiency sodium ion storage.",
        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) is most likely to be a commercialized anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, its low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) impedes its further large-scale industrialization. Since the ICE is greatly related to the side reactions of the electrolyte on the HC surface, herein, we focus on tailoring the surface chemistry of HC via a facile low-temperature oxygen plasma (LTOP) treatment technique. The modified HC after a suitable treatment time possesses a highly ordered and low defect surface without a negligible change in layer spacing, thus facilitating Na+ deinsertion/insertion and reducing the HC/electrolyte side reactions. Moreover, LTOP treatment also brings oxygen functional groups (CO) to the HC surface to enrich Na+ storage active sites. Consequently, the modified HC reveals a higher ICE of 80.9% compared to 60.6% in the bare HC. Also, the modified HC delivers an ultrahigh specific capacity of 331.0 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and exhibits superior rate performance with a high specific capacity of 211.0 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1. This work provides a feasible strategy to tailor the surface chemistry of HC for high-efficiency Na-storage and provides a novel avenue to construct high-efficiency SIBs.",

        "title": "Composition Analysis of the Solid Electrolyte Interface of NaK Anodes in Na-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have emerged as a promising alternative to Li-ion batteries due to the abundance of sodium. However, anodes in Na-ion batteries face challenges such as dendrite formation and an unstable solid electrolyte interface layer. To address these challenges, NaK liquid metal alloy anodes have been proposed as an alternative because they do not form dendrites. In our study, we demonstrate that the NaK alloy anode interacts with the commonly used ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate electrolyte, leading to a continuously growing unstable SEI layer, evidenced by cycling failures under 100 cycles and an increasing charge transfer resistance in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies. In situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that over the course of cycling the surface of the NaK anode becomes increasingly sodium-rich. After 30 cycles, XPS analysis detects only trace amounts of potassium on the NaK anode surface. When the electrolyte is analyzed postcycling using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, there is a noticeable increase in potassium levels, suggesting that potassium metal dissolves into the electrolyte. The introduction of a 10 wt % fluoroethylene carbonate additive can mitigate this problem to some extent, enabling an enhanced cycling performance of up to 800 cycles at 1C. Nevertheless, the dissolution of K metal is still evident in the XPS results, albeit to a lesser degree. These discoveries provide valuable insights for designing a more robust SEI layer for the NaK anode.",

To address this tough issue, a novel desolvation-free sodium dual-ion battery (SDIB) has been proposed by using artificial graphite (AG) as anode and polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) as cathode. Combining the cation-solvent co-intercalation and anion storage chemistry, such a SDIB operated with ether-based electrolyte can intrinsically eliminate the sluggish desolvation process. Hence, it can exhibit an extremely fast kinetics of 10 A g -1 (corresponding to 100C-rate) with a high capacity retention of 45%. Moreover, the desolvation-free mechanism endows the battery with 61% of its room-temperature capacity at an ultra-low temperature of -70°C.

In this work, we synthesize ultra-small SnS quantum dots (QDs) anchored onto nitrogen-enriched carbon (NC) nanospheres through facile hydrothermal and carbonization processes to prepare a progressive anode material for sodium-ion batteries. The optimized SnS QDs@NC electrode delivered an initial discharge capacity of 281 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 and exhibited excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 75% after 500 cycles at high current density of 1,000 mA g-1. Ex-situ XRD, XPS, FE-SEM, TEM measurements and kinetic study were performed to unveil the sodium storage mechanism of the SnS QDs@NC electrode. A sodium-ion full cell assembled with SnS QDs@NC anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode exhibited high capacity and good cycling stability. Such a superior electrochemical performance of SnS QDs@NC can be attributed to the synergistic effects of NC and SnS QDs, where NC serves as a conducting matrix to support SnS QDs and helps avoid structural degradation.

        "abstract": "The demand for versatile and sustainable energy materials is on the rise, given the importance of developing novel clean technologies for transition to a net zero economy. Here, we present the synthesis, characterization, and application of lignin-derived ordered mesoporous carbons with various pore sizes (from 5 to approximately 50 nm) as anodes in sodium-ion batteries. We have varied the pore size using self-synthesized PEOn-b-PHAm block copolymers with different PEO and PHA chain lengths, applying the “soft templating” approach to introduce isolated spherical pores of 20 to 50 nm in diameters. The pore structure was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nitrogen physisorption, and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). We report the microstructure analysis of such mesoporous lignin-based carbons using Raman spectroscopy and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). In comparison with nontemplated carbon and carbons templated employing commercial Pluronic F-127 and PIB50-b-PEO45, which created accessible channels and spherical pores up to approximately 10 nm in diameter, the carbon microstructure analysis revealed that templating with all applied polymers significantly impedes graphitization upon thermal treatment. Furthermore, the gained knowledge of similar carbon microstructures regardless of the type of template allowed the investigation of the influence of different pore morphologies in carbon applied as an anode material in sodium-ion batteries, supporting the previous theories in the literature that closed pores are beneficial for sodium storage while providing insights into the importance of pore size.",

The CoC2O4·2H2O/rGO electrode delivers specific capacity of 1011.5 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 200 cycles for lithium storage, and exhibits high capacity of 221.1 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 100 cycles for sodium storage.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are expected to be a promising commercial alternative to lithium-ion batteries for grid electricity storage due to their potential low cost in the near future. Up to the present, the anode material still remains a great challenge for the application of SIBs, especially at room temperature. Graphite has an obvious limitation to store larger radius sodium ions (Na+) in comparison with lithium ions (Li+), while the hard carbon with large interlayer distance can demonstrate a relatively high storage capability and durable cycle life. However, the disadvantages of low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) mainly caused by large surface area and high cost synthetic approach hinder its practical applications. Herein, a new coupled carbonization strategy is presented to prepare a cost-effective hard carbon material by pyrolyzing and carbonizing the mixture of abundant sucrose and phenolic resin. Benefiting from the specialized pyrolysis reaction process and optimized conditions as studied in detail, the hard carbon has an extremely low surface area of 1.54 m2 g-1 and high initial Coulombic efficiency of 87%, which have been rarely reported before and enhance the utilization efficiency of Na+ consumption within the cathode in the future. More importantly, the hard carbon, with a high interlayer distance 3.95 Å, can deliver a higher capacity of 319 mAh g-1 and maintain a finer capacity retention of 90% over 150 cycles. Besides, a full cell with the configuration of as-prepared hard carbon anode versus an air-stable O3-Na0.9[Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48]O2 cathode is further presented, and it has a high ICE of 80% and energy density of 256 Wh kganode-1 (vs hard carbon) with reliable cycle performance. The results demonstrate that our synthetic strategy is feasible and extendable, while the tunable carbon-based materials should have wider applications in addition to the attractive properties in Na-ion batteries.",

In this work, a kind of Na metal anode with record-high utilization and long-term cycling stability is reported, using carbon substrate-supported nitrogen-anchored zinc (Zn) single atoms as current collector. Single Zn atom sites serve as a strong \"magnet\" for Na ions, which guide the metallic Na uniform nucleation and free from dendrite-induced short circuit. The nucleation overpotential of our strategy is essentially zero, where most of the reported modified substrates are greatly exceed 20 mV. Specifically, the Na anodes exhibit a high Na stripping/plating Coulombic efficiency with 99.8% over 350 cycles and a stable voltage response with small voltage hysteresis after cycling 1000 h. The full cell exhibits high Na-utilization up to 100% and superior long-term cycling stability for more than 1000 cycles with excellent capacity retention. In terms of both lifetime and Na-utilization, our strategy are significantly outperforms the reported state-of-the-art Na metal anodes. Moreover, this affords new insights into the controllable Na nucleation behavior and high Na utilization, and sheds a fresh light on atomic level design of electrode for Na metal anodes.",

The targeted pore structure and electrochemical performance are optimized by controlling the amount of methyl methacrylate monomers via free-radical polymerization, and carbonized temperature via pyrolysis treatment. The constructed carbon materials display a stable 3D fibrous network with a large specific area and abundant micro/mesopores formed during the pyrolysis of the polymer poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA).

It is interesting that it possesses superior low-potential capacity, and retains 42% of the total capacity even at a high scan rate of 1 mV s-1.

Specifically, the strategy involves a two-step annealing process, which converts the MnCO3 microparticles into nanoporous Mn2O3 and MnS step by step. The 3D N, S codoped carbon layer is in situ formed during the second annealing process by first coating the nanoporous Mn2O3 with a polyaniline layer. Due to the inherent 3D carbon protection and the strong electronic interaction between N, S dopants and MnS, the N, S codoped carbon protected MnS obtained at 900 °C (NS-C@MnS-900) anode displays a high specific capacity of 845 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, which is higher than all reported MnS-based SIB anodes. It also shows an outstanding cyclability and rate performance, maintaining a stable capacity of ≈493 mAh g-1 after 1300 cycles at 10 A g-1, which is also the best according to knowledge. These exceptional electrochemical performances and the scalable/simple/low-cost synthesis make the NS-C@MnS-900 attractive for industry application.",

        "abstract": "The pseudo‐layered sulfide NiCr2S4 exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance as anode material in sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). The Na storage mechanism is investigated by synchrotron‐based X‐ray scattering and absorption techniques as well as by electrochemical measurements. A very high reversible capacity in the 500th cycle of 489 mAh g−1 is observed at 2.0 A g−1 in the potential window 3.0–0.1 V. Full discharge includes irreversible generation of Ni0 and Cr0 nanoparticles embedded in nanocrystalline Na2S yielding shortened diffusion lengths and predominantly surface‐controlled charge storage. During charge, Ni0 and Cr0 are oxidized, Na2S is consumed, and amorphous Ni and Cr sulfides are formed. Limiting the potential window to 3.0–0.3 V an unusual nickel extrusion sodium insertion mechanism occurs: Ni2+ is reduced to nanosized Ni0 domains, expelled from the host lattice, and is replaced by Na+ cations to form O3‐type like NaCrS2. Surprisingly, the discharge and charge processes comprise Na+ shuttling between highly crystalline NiCr2S4 and NaCrS2 enabling a superior long‐term stability for 3000 cycles. The results not only provide valuable insights for the electrochemistry of conversion materials but also extend the scope of layered electrode materials considering the reversible nickel extrusion sodium insertion reaction as new concept for SIBs.",

Transition metal selenides have attracted considerable attention because of their high reversible capacity, superior electrical conductivity and versatile structures. In this study, two-dimensional CuSe nanosheets are synthesized via a simple hydrothermal reaction. When acting as an electrode material for sodium-ion batteries, the CuSe electrode exhibits an initial coulombic efficiency of 96.7% at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 and a specific capacity of 330 mA h g−1 after 100 operation cycles, as well as retains a specific capacity of 211 mA h g−1 even at a high current density of 10 A g−1. Moreover, the anode delivers a specific capacity of 236 mA h g−1 after 3300 cycles at 5 A g−1 with a capacity retention of 91.2%. In sodium-ion hybrid capacitors (SHICs) with the two-dimensional CuSe nanosheets and Ti3C2Tx MXene as the negative and positive materials, respectively, the nanosheets without any pre-sodiation present a lifespan of up to 2000 cycles at 2 A g−1 and a capacity retention of about 77.7%.",

        "abstract": "At the research level, novel active materials for batteries are synthesised on a small scale, fabricated into electrodes and electrochemically characterised using each group’s established process due to the lack of standards. Recently, eminent researchers have criticised the implementation of e.g. low active material contents/electrode loadings, the use of research‐type battery cell constructions, or the lack of statistically relevant data, resulting in overstated data and thus giving misleading predictions of the key performance indicators of new battery technologies. Here, we report on the establishment of a reference system for the development of sodium‐ion batteries. Electrodes are fabricated under relevant conditions using 9.5 mg/cm² self‐synthesised Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode active material and 3.6 mg/cm² commercially available hard carbon anode active material. It is found that different types of battery cells are more or less suitable for half‐ and/ or full‐cell testing, resulting in ir/reproducible or underestimated active material capacities. Furthermore, the influence of electrode overhang, which is relevant for upscaling, is evaluated. The demonstrator cell (TRL 4‐5) has been further characterised providing measured data on the power/energy density and thermal behaviour during rate testing up to 15 C and projections are made for its practical limits.",

However, the low conductivity and poor cycling stability at high current densities hamper their applications.

The single‐layered MoS2 is confined in the carbon matrix. The mesopores between the composite nanorods provide fast electrolyte diffusion. The obtained nanocomposite shows a high sodium‐storage capability, excellent rate capacity, and very good cycling performance. A capacity of 310 mAh g−1 can remain at 5.0 A g−1 after 2500 cycles.

Not only accelerate the Na+ ions diffusion, but also augment the stress resistance and the electrochemical reaction reversibility for the multiphase composite. Furthermore, the porous structure finely increases the ions diffusion kinetics, preventing the aggregation of Sn, Sb, and SSO particles, which achieves high reversible capacity while eliminating structure damage. As a consequence, the fabricated SSO@Sn/Sb‐PCWs electrode exhibited exceptional cycling stability, maintaining a high reversible capacity of 448 mAh g−1 after 150 charge/discharge cycles, and good rate capability with current density up to 5.0 A g−1.

X‐ray absorption spectra at the S K‐edge and Mo L3‐edge are recorded using a synchrotron source, X‐ray emission S Kα and Mo Lα spectra are obtained on a laboratory spectrometer for initial powder and electrode material at different potentials of the cell. Analysis of the spectra shows the occupation of the initially empty orbitals of MoS2 by sodium electrons as a result of the interaction of the components of the sodium‐ion half‐cell. Ex situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of a fully discharged electrode material reveal partial transformation of hexagonal MoS2 to disordered tetragonal MoS2 coated with a surface electrolyte interphase layer.

All of the Sn nanoparticles exhibit a dramatic initial volume expansion of about 420% after sodiation to Na15Sn4.

However, the absence of suitable anode materials is the main bottleneck for the commercial application of SIBs. Herein, the adsorption and diffusion behaviors of Na on graphether are predicted by first-principles density functional calculations. Our results show that Na atoms can be adsorbed on graphether forming a uniform and stable coverage on both sides. Even at low intercalated Na concentrations, the semiconducting graphether can be changed to a metallic state, ensuring good electrical conductivity. Due to the structural anisotropy of graphether, the Na+ ions show a remarkable one-dimensional diffusion with an ultralow energy barrier of 0.04 eV, suggesting ultrafast charge/discharge characteristics. The graphether monolayer has a high theoretical specific capacity of 670 mA h g-1, which is much higher than commercial graphite anode materials. Furthermore, the average voltage is 1.58 V, comparable with that of commercial TiO2 anode materials for LIBs (1.5 V). During the charge/discharge process, graphether could mostly preserve the structural integrity upon the adsorption of Na even at the maximum concentration, suggesting its good reversibility.

As a proof of concept, some of the phosphate of Na3V2(PO4)3 was replaced by silicate to fabricate Na3V2(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1, which exhibited a higher average discharge voltage of 3.36 V and a higher capacity of 115.8 mA h g-1 than pristine Na3V2(PO4)3 (3.31 V, 109.6 mA h g-1) at 0.5 C, therefore improving the energy density. Moreover, the introduced silicate enhanced the intrinsic electroconductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3 materials, as confirmed by both theoretical simulation and electrochemical measurements. After pairing with a commercial hard carbon anode, the optimized Na3V2(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1 cathode enabled a stable-cycling full cell with 90.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 5 C and a remarkable average coulombic efficiency of 99.88%.",

In this work, we synthesized an N-doped rGO/MoS2 (ISE, interlayer spacing enlarged) composite based on an innovative strategy to serve as an anode material for SIBs. By inserting NH4+ into the interlayer of MoS2, the interlayer spacing of MoS2 was successfully expanded to 0.98 nm. Further use of N plasma treatment achieved the doping of N element. The results show that N-rGO/MoS2(ISE) exhibits a high specific capacity of 542 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles at 200 mA g-1. It is worth mentioning that the capacity retention rate reaches an ultra-large percentage of 97.13%, and the average decline percentage per cycle is close to 0.01%. Moreover, it also presents an excellent rate performance (477, 432, 377, 334 mA h g-1 at 200, 500, 1000, 2000 m A g-1 respectively). This work reveals a unique approach to fabricating promising anode materials and the electrochemical reaction mechanism for SIBs.",

        "title": "Composition and Structure of the solid electrolyte interphase on Na-Ion Anodes Revealed by Exo- and Endogenous Dynamic Nuclear Polarization—NMR Spectroscopy",
        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (SIB) are among the most promising devices for large scale energy storage. Their stable and long-term performance depends on the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), a nanosized, heterogeneous and disordered layer, formed due to degradation of the electrolyte at the anode surface. The chemical and structural properties of the SEI control the charge transfer process at the electrode–electrolyte interface, thus, there is great interest in determining these properties for understanding, and ultimately controlling, SEI functionality. However, the study of the SEI is notoriously challenging due to its heterogeneous nature and minute quantity. In this work, we present a powerful approach for probing the SEI based on solid state NMR spectroscopy with increased sensitivity from dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). Utilizing exogenous (organic radicals) and endogenous (paramagnetic metal ion dopants) DNP sources, we obtain not only a detailed compositional map of the SEI but also, for the first time for the native SEI, determine the spatial distribution of its constituent phases. Using this approach, we perform a thorough investigation of the SEI formed on Li4Ti5O12 used as a SIB anode. We identify a compositional gradient, from organic phases at the electrolyte interface to inorganic phases toward the anode surface. We find that the use of fluoroethylene carbonate as an electrolyte additive leads to performance degradation which can be attributed to formation of a thicker SEI, rich in NaF and carbonates. We expect that this methodology can be extended to examine other titanate anodes and new electrolyte compositions, offering a unique tool for SEI investigations to enable the development of effective and long-lasting SIBs.",

As a remedy, we here present a novel aqueous electrolyte, which inhibits the PTCDA dissolution and enables their use as all‐organic ASIB anodes with high capacity retention and Coulombic efficiencies. Furthermore, the electrolyte is based on two, hence “hybrid”, inexpensive and non‐fluorinated Na/Mg‐salts, it displays favourable physico‐chemical properties and an electrochemical stability window >3 V without resorting to the extreme salt concentrations of water‐in‐salt electrolytes.

        "abstract": "Zinc sulfide (ZnS) exhibits promise in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of its low operation voltage and high theoretical specific capacity. However, pristine ZnS is not adequate in realizing rapid and robust sodium storage owing to its low reversibility, poor structure stability, and sluggish kinetics. To date, most efforts focus on utilizing carbonaceous incorporation to improve its electrochemical performances. Nevertheless, it remains an arduous challenge for realizing superior rate capability while obtaining stable cycling. Herein, inspired by the crystal structure of hexagonal ZnIn2S4, which possesses an intrinsic layered feature with larger unit-cell volume versus that of ZnS, indium incorporation is thus deployed as an immediate remedy. In/ex situ investigations combined with density functional theory calculations are conducted to reveal the superior kinetics, high reversibility, and good structure stability of ZnIn2S4. Notably, the formed indium-based derivatives during cycling manifest a Na+ (de)intercalation process, thereby exciting a synergetic mechanism to stabilize electrochemical cycling. As a result, the electrochemical performances of Zn-based sulfide are significantly improved via the indium incorporation. Furthermore, a full cell based on the ZnIn2S4 anode with the superior electrochemical performance is developed. This work provides an effective tactic of heteroatom incorporation for optimizing structure as well as exciting a complementary reaction process toward developing superior anodes for high-performance alkali-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Iron sulfide (FeS) has been extensively studied as sodium‐ion battery anodes due to its high theoretical capacity (609 mAh g−1), but its large volume expansion and low electrical conductivity result in unsatisfactory cycling life and poor rate performance. Moreover, the sodium ion storage mechanism of FeS at a voltage range of 0.01–1 V involving conversion reactions and subsequent ion storage process is unclear yet. Here, the study proposes a vapor‐pressure induced synthesis route to fabricate FeS/C yolk‐shell structure that ultrathin carbon layers coat on the surface of FeS nanosheets, which can accommodate volume expansion of FeS during sodiation observed via in situ transmission electron microscope and improve its electrical conductivity. Remarkably, an in situ magnetometry reveals that vast spin‐polarized electrons can be injected into superparamagnetic Fe nanoparticles (≈3 nm) formed during conversion reaction to induce evolution of electrode magnetization between 0.01 and 1 V, during which spin‐polarized surface capacitance effect occurs at Fe/Na2S interfaces to increase extra ion storage and boost ion transport stably. Consequently, the FeS/C yolk‐shell nanosheets deliver a high reversible capacity of 664.9 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, and 300.4 mAh g−1 after 10 000 cycles at 10 A g−1 with a capacity retention of 81.1%.",

In situ transmission electron microscopy images reveal the preferential expansion along the transverse direction of the nanorods upon the first discharging, which arises from the reduction of SbPO4 to Sb and the subsequent alloying of Sb as supported by in situ X-ray diffraction and selected area electron diffraction patterns. SbPO4/rGO exhibits a capacity retention of 99% after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g-1 both in half cells and in full cells. Its specific capacity at 5 A g-1 is 214 mA h g-1 in half cells or 134 mA h g-1 in full cells.

        "abstract": "In response to the increasing concern for energy management, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been extensively researched as an attractive anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The proficient cycling durability and good rate performance of SIBs are the two key parameters that determine their potential for practical use. In this study, nature-inspired three-dimensional (3D) MoS2 ultrathin marigold flower-like microstructures were prepared by a controlled hydrothermal method. These microscale flowers are constructed by arbitrarily arranged but closely interconnected two-dimensional ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets. The as-prepared MoS2 microflowers (MFs) have then been chemically wrapped by layered graphene sheets to form the bonded 3D hybrid MoS2-G networks. TEM, SEM, XRD, XPS, and Raman characterizations were used to study the morphology, crystallization, chemical compositions, and wrapping contact between MoS2 and graphene. The ultrathin nature of MoS2 in 3D MFs and graphene wrapping provide strong electrical conductive channels and conductive networks in an electrode. Benefitting from the 2 nm ultrathin crystalline MoS2 sheets, chemically bonded graphene, defect-induced sodium storage active sites, and 3D interstitial spaces, the prepared electrode exhibited an outstanding specific capacity (606 mA h g-1 at 200 mA g-1), remarkable rate performance (345 mA h g-1 at 1600 mA g-1), and long cycle life (over 100 cycles with tremendous Coulombic efficiencies beyond 100%).

        "abstract": "Porous carbon has been widely focused to solve the problems of low coulombic efficiency (ICE) and low multiplication capacity of Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) anodes. The superior energy storage properties of two-dimensional(2D) carbon nanosheets can be realized by modulating the structure, but be limited by the carbon sources, making it challenging to obtain 2D structures with large surface area. In this work, a new method for forming carbon materials with high N/S doping content based on combustion activation using the dual activation effect of K2 SO4 /KNO3 is proposed. The synthesized carbon material as an anode for SIBs has a high reversible capacity of 344.44 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 . Even at the current density of 5 Ag-1 , the capacity remained at 143.08 mAh g-1 . And the ICE of sodium-ion in ether electrolytes is ≈2.5 times higher than that in ester electrolytes. The sodium storage mechanism of ether/ester-based electrolytes is further explored through ex-situ characterizations. The disparity in electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the discrepancy in kinetics, wherein ether-based electrolytes exhibit a higher rate of Na+ storage and shedding compared to ester-based electrolytes. This work suggests an effective way to develop doubly doped carbon anode materials for SIBs.",

Despite exhibiting a stable cyclability performance, the SSBs prepared using the LE modification and composite cathode approach possess a low AM loading of < 1 mg·cm−2. On the other hand, the SSBs with infiltrated‐cathode exhibit a superior discharge capacity of ∼ 102 mAh·g−1 at 0.2C and less than 5% capacity fading after 50 cycles at room temperature. Notably, these cells contain a high AM loading of 2.12 mg·cm−2. The microstructural analysis reveals the presence of AM particles inside the pores of the porous SE, allowing for the efficient insertion/removal of sodium ions. The porous scaffold of SE not only provides continuous sodium‐ion conduction pathways inside the cathode structure but also renders stability by accommodating stress induced by volume change during repeated cycling. The outcomes of this work demonstrate the effectiveness of the wet‐chemical infiltration technique in improving the AM loading and storage capacity performance of SSBs working at 25°C.",

        "abstract": "Layer‐structured bismuth (Bi) is an attractive anode for Na‐ion and K‐ion batteries due to its large volumetric capacity and suitable redox potentials. However, the cycling stability and rate capability of the Bi anode are restricted by the large volume expansion and sluggish Na/K‐storage kinetics. Herein, a structural dimensionality reduction strategy is proposed and developed by converting 2D‐layer‐structured Bi into a quasi‐1D structured NiBi3 with enhanced reaction kinetics and reversibility to realize high‐rate and stable cycling performance for Na/K‐ion storage. As a proof of concept, the quasi‐1D intermetallic NiBi3 with low formation energy, metallic conductivity, and 3D Na/K‐ion diffusion pathways delivers outstanding capacity retention of 94.1% (332 mAh g−1) after 15 000 cycles for Na‐ion storage, and high initial coulombic efficiency of 93.4% with improved capacity retention for K‐ion storage. Moreover, investigations on the highly reversible Na/K‐storage reaction mechanisms and cycling‐driven morphology reconstruction further reveal the origins of the high reversibility and the accommodation to volume expansion. The finding of this work provides a new strategy for high‐performance anode design by structural dimensionality manipulation and cycling‐driven morphology reconstruction.",

Here, we exploit our expertise to control the deposition of a nm-sized conformal coating of carbon nitride with tunable thickness to improve the electrochemical performance of anode material derived from sodium lignosulfonate. In this way, we significantly enhanced the electrochemical performances of the electrode, such as the first cycle efficiency, rate-capability, and specific capacity. In particular, with a 10 nm homogeneous carbon nitride coating, the specific capacity is extended by more than 30% with respect to the bare carbon material with an extended plateau capacity, which we attribute to a heterojunction effect at the materials' interface.

Here, the practicability of solid‐state electrochemical (SSE) pre‐sodiation technique for hard carbon anode is assessed to conquer such challenges. The uniformly pre‐sodiated HC (Pre‐HC) can be fabricated through the SSE reaction between the HC and preloaded sodium metal film without introducing a liquid electrolyte. After being immerged in the electrolyte, a thin artificial SEI with abundant inorganic species is formed on the surface of Pre‐HC due to the spontaneous chemical reaction, and the ICE of HC is improved from 76.0% to 107.9%. Full cell paired with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode exhibits a high ICE of 94.0% with 70% of energy density augment (from 126.5 to 214.4 Wh kg−1) after anode pre‐sodiation. Pre‐HC anode still retains the pre‐sodiation capacity of 671.1 mAh gNa−1 after being stored in the dry air for 2 h.

However, the practical application of these materials is usually limited by their low electronic conductivity and serious volume change during the charging-discharging process. Herein, we report the fabrication of 3D-0D graphene-Fe3O4 quantum dot hybrids by a facile one-pot hydrothermal approach as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Fe3O4 quantum dots with an average size of 4.9 nm are anchored on the surface of 3D structured graphene nanosheets homogeneously. Such unique hierarchical structure are advantageous for enlarging the electrode/electrolyte interface area and enhancing the electrochemical activity of the hybrid materials, inhibiting particle aggregation of Fe3O4 and accommodating their volume change during the charging-discharging process as well as enabling fast diffusion of electrons and rapid transfer of electrolyte ions. Consequently, the 3D-0D graphene-Fe3O4 quantum dot hybrids exhibit ultrahigh sodium storage capacity (525 mAh g-1 at 30 mA g-1), outstanding cycling stability (312 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles at 50 mA g-1) and superior rate performance (56 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1).",

However, the major challenge is the large volume change during cycling processes, bringing about rapid capacity decay. Herein, to cope with this issue, through electrostatic spinning and high temperature calcination reduction, the unique bean pod-like free-standing membrane is designed initially, filling SbSn dots into integrated carbon matrix including hollow carbon spheres and nitrogen-doped carbon fibers (B-SbSn/NCFs). Significantly, the synergistic carbon matrix not only improves the conductivity and flexibility, but provides enough buffer space to alleviate the large volume change of metal particles. More importantly, the B-SbSn/NCFs free-standing membrane can be directly used as the anode without polymer binder and conductive agent, which improves the energy density and reaction kinetics. Satisfyingly, the free-standing BSbSn/NCFs membrane anode shows excellent electrochemical performance in SIB. The specific capacity of the membrane electrode can maintain 486.9 mAh g-1 and the coulombic efficiency is close to 100% after 400 cycles at 100 mA g-1 .

        "abstract": "Na-ion batteries (NIBs) have attracted increasing attention given the fact that sodium is relatively more plentiful and affordable than lithium for sustainable and large-scale energy storage systems. However, the shortage of electrode materials with outstanding comprehensive properties has limited the practical implementations of NIBs. Among all the discovered anode materials, transition-metal sulfide has been proven as one of the most competitive and promising ones due to its excellent redox reversibility and relatively high theoretical capacity. In this study, double-morphology N-doped CoS2/multichannel carbon nanofibers composites (CoS2/MCNFs) are precisely designed, which overcome common issues such as the poor cycling life and inferior rate performance of CoS2 electrodes. The conductive 3D interconnected multichannel nanostructure of CoS2/MCNFs provides efficient buffer zones for the release of mechanical stresses from Na+ ions intercalation/deintercalation. The synergy of the diverse structural features enables a robust frame and a rapid electrochemical reaction in CoS2/MCNFs anode, resulting in an impressive long-term cycling life of 900 cycles with a capacity of 620 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 (86.4% theoretical capacity) and a surprisingly high-power output.

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion hybrid supercapacitors (Na‐HSCs) by virtue of synergizing the merits of batteries and supercapacitors have attracted considerable attention for high‐energy and high‐power energy‐storage applications. Orthorhombic Nb2O5 (T‐Nb2O5) has recently been recognized as a promising anode material for Na‐HSCs due to its typical pseudocapacitive feature, but it suffers from intrinsically low electrical conductivity. Reasonably high electrochemical performance of T‐Nb2O5‐based electrodes could merely be gained to date when sufficient carbon content was introduced. In addition, flexible Na‐HSC devices have scarcely been demonstrated by far. Herein, an in situ encapsulation strategy is devised to directly grow ultrathin graphene shells over T‐Nb2O5 nanowires (denoted as Gr‐Nb2O5 composites) by plasma‐enhanced chemical vapor deposition, targeting a highly conductive anode material for Na‐HSCs. The few‐layered graphene capsules with ample topological defects would enable facile electron and Na+ ion transport, guaranteeing rapid pseudocapacitive processes at the Nb2O5/electrolyte interface. The Na‐HSC full‐cell comprising a Gr‐Nb2O5 anode and an activated carbon cathode delivers high energy/power densities (112.9 Wh kg−1/80.1 W kg−1 and 62.2 Wh kg−1/5330 W kg−1), outperforming those of recently reported Na‐HSC counterparts.

        "abstract": "Bismuth (Bi) have been demonstrated as promising anode for Na-ion batteries (NIBs) because it has high gravimetry (386 mAh g-1) and volumetric capacity (3800 mAh cm-3). However, Bi suffers from large volume expansion during sodiation, leading to poor electrochemical performance. Construction nanostructure with sufficient void space to accommodate the volume change has been proven effective for achieving prolonged cycling stability. But the excessive void space will definitely decrease the volumetric energy density of battery. Herein, we design an optimized Bi@Void@C nanospheres (Bi@Void@C-2) with yolk-shell structure that exhibits the best cycling performance and enhanced volumetric energy density. The optimized void space could not only buffer the volume change of the Bi nanosphere, but also could keep the high volumetric energy density of battery. The Bi@Void@C-2 shows an excellent rate capacity of 173 mAh g-1 at ultra-high current density of 100 A g-1 and long-cycle life (198 mAh g-1 at 20A g-1 over 10000 cycles). The origin of the superior performance is achieved through in-depth fundamental studies during battery operation using in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and in-situ transmission electron microscope (TEM), complemented by theoretical calculations and ex-situ TEM observation. Our rational design provides insights for anode materials with large volume variation, especially for conversion type and alloying type mechanism materials for batteries (i.e. Li-ion batteries, Na-ion batteries).",

Among the various electrolytes investigated, sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI) (0.5 M) in BMPTFSI shows the best electrochemical performance with a significant improvement in cycling stability (90% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 50 mA g-1 in a half cell versus Na metal anode) compared with conventional NaClO4 (1 M) in ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate electrolytes (39% retention after 500 cycles). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies reveal that ionic liquid electrolytes are stable up to 4.8 V versus Na/Na+. When NaFSI and NaTFSI are used as conducting salts, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results prove that the cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) is composed of components resulting from the decomposition of the TFSI anion and the deposition of the BMP cation. On the other hand, the CEI layer of the electrode cycled in an electrolyte containing NaClO4 in BMPTFSI follows a different pathway of TFSI decomposition and consists mainly of sodium fluoride. Similarly, plating studies were used to understand the stability of different ionic liquids in contact with metallic sodium. It was found that the excellent capacity retention for the electrolyte consisting of NaFSI salt is related to the formation of a stable CEI and solid electrolyte interphase layers.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are regarded as cost-effective alternatives or competitors to lithium-ion batteries for large-scale electric energy storage applications. However, their development has been hindered by the high cost of hard carbon (HC) anodes and poor electrochemical performance. To enhance the sodium storage capacity and rate performance of HC, this study accelerated the electrochemical performance of coconut-shell-derived HC anodes for SIBs through N/O codoping using ball milling and pyrolysis. Experimental results demonstrate that the simultaneous introduction of N and O generates a synergistic effect, increasing the surface oxygen-containing functional groups, defects, and interlayer spacing of coconut-shell-derived HC through the codoping of light elements. The excellent strategy has increased the slope capacity and platform capacity of HC, and the synergistic modification of N/O has increased its reversible specific capacity from 272 to 343 mA h g-1 (30 mA g-1), with a retention rate of approximately 92.1% after 100 cycles. In addition, it also exhibits an excellent rate performance, reaching 178 mA h g-1 at 1500 mA g-1. In summary, this study presents an effective strategy for modifying biomass-derived HC.",

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional ordered superstructures have been attracting considerable attention due to their interesting properties and potential applications. However, designing ideal functional superstructures with excellent electrochemical properties is still a major challenge, and an in-depth understanding of the structure-activity relationship of electrodes remains to be achieved. To elucidate this critical issue, herein, we rationally designed and synthesized for the first time superstructured TiO2/dual-doped mesoporous carbon anodes using confined space and surface coassembly strategies. Our method primarily relied on the larger interlayer space few-layered MXene and its negatively charged surface, allowing hexamethylenetetramine intercalation and surface electrostatic adsorption. The superstructured TiO2/dual-doped mesoporous carbon was successfully assembled by the thermal decomposition of a confined carbon precursor. Subsequently, the comparison of Na+-storage properties of various anodes was carried out based on the results of structural characterization techniques and electrochemical analysis methods. The results showed that the optimized anode (N/O-C@TiO2-20) can deliver a reversible capacity of 165 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g-1, indicating excellent electrochemical properties. The enhancement can be attributed to the synergistic effect of carbon domains, defective nanocrystals, and a covalently coupled interface between TiO2 and mesoporous carbon. Our work not only offered a new strategy for the assembly and regulation of superstructures to promote the electrochemical performance but also enlightened the rational design of advanced anodes for sodium-ion battery application.",

        "abstract": "Low intrinsic conductivity and structural instability of MoS2 as an anode of sodium-ion batteries limit the liberation of its theoretical capacity. Herein, density functional theory simulations for the first time optimize MoS2 interlayer distance between 0.80 and 1.01 nm for sodium storage. 1-Butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium acetate ([BMIm]Ac) induces cellulose oligomers to intercalate MoS2 interlayers for achieving controllable distance by changing the mass ratio of cellulose to [BMIm]Ac. Based on these findings, porous carbon loading the interlayer-expanded MoS2 allowing Na+ to insert with fast kinetics is synthesized. A carbon layer derived from [BMIm]Ac and cellulose coating the composite prevents the MoS2 from contacting electrolytes, leading to less sulfur loss for a more reversible specific capacity. Meanwhile, MoS2 and carbon have a strong interfacial connection through MoN binding, contributing to enhanced structural stability. As expected, while cycling 250 times at 0.1 A g-1 , the MoS2 -porous carbon composite displays an optimal reversible capacity at 517.79 mAh g-1 as a sodium-ion batteries anode. The cyclic test of 1.0 A g-1 also shows considerable stability (310.74 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles with 86.26% retentive capacity). This study will open up new possibilities of modifying MoS2 that serves as an applicable material as sodium-ion battery anode.",

Herein, using a polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) anode as an example, we demonstrated that a moderate pyrolysis of the polymer anode could not only reduce its optical bandgap to enhance its electronic conductivity but also tune its microstructures to facilitate Na+ transfer/storage and sustain the repeated sodiation/desodiation. When used as NIBs anode with 10 wt % conductive carbon adding for preparing the electrode film, the moderate-pyrolysis PCN can promise high specific capacity (351 mAh g-1 at 0.1C), superb rate capability (151 and 95 mAh g-1 at 10C and 20C, respectively), and ultrastable cyclability (88.5% capacity retention after 6500 cycles at 2C).

Starting from micron-sized Co(IPC)·H2O (IPC: 4-(imidazole-1-yl) phthalic acid) and polydopamine as the metal-organic framework (MOF) precursor and carbon source, respectively, we produced a CoS2/C/C composite constituting CoS2 nanoparticles decorated with N-doped carbon layers and subjected to sulfurization. N-doped carbon layers provided a robust network for the CoS2 nanoparticles, enhancing the structural integrity and electronic conductivity of the resulting CoS2/C/C composite, which exhibited electrochemical performance superior to most existing CoS2 composites, and was one of the best among all MOF derived CoS2 anodes for LIBs and SIBs. The use of nanosized CoS2 particles reduced the diffusion length for the transfer of Li+/Na+ ions, resulting in a high specific capacity at a higher current rate. N-doped carbon layers derived from the MOF precursor and polydopamine provided an electrically conductive network between the CoS2 nanoparticles, thus preventing their aggregation and inhibiting adverse side reactions between the electrolyte and the surface of the electrode, and the high pseudocapacitive contribution resulted in the enhanced rate performance of the CoS2/C/C electrodes.",

However, challenges persist in achiving prolonged cycling stability and consistent capacity, and the sodium storage mechanism in HC is still debated. Herein, an unreported biomass precursor, \"sisal,\" for deriving hard carbon is developed. A series of sisal hemp-derived hard carbon with natural 3D porous channels are prepared. Through phase characterization and electrochemical testing, the relationship between microstructure and sodium storage capacity is elucidated, further confirming the suitability of the \"adsorption-insertion-filling\" mechanism for sodium storage properties in hard carbon materials. Without the need for any additional modification strategies, this biomass-derived hard carbon demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance in both sodium-ion and potassium-ion batteries (SIBs and PIBs). The as-prepared HC-1300 demonstrates excellent ion storage capability, delivering a high reversible capacity of 345.2 mAh g-1 in SIBs and 310 mAh g-1 in PIBs at 0.1 C. Moreover, it maintains a specific capacity of 237.3 mAh g-1 over 1200 cycles at 1 C when used in SIBs.

The incorporation of OVs into TiO2 is demonstrated to render considerably enhanced-rate performances, higher initial capacities, and an accelerated electrochemical activation process during cycling, derived from the boosted intrinsic electric conductivity and improved kinetics of Na uptake. Bestowed with the integrated merits of OVs and shortened Na ion diffusion length in the nanostructure, black titania delivers a reversible specific capacity of 207.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, retains 99.1% over 500 cycles at 1 C stably, and still maintains 91.2 mAh g(-1) even at the high rate of 20 C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the lower sodiation energy barrier of anatase with OVs enables a more favorable Na intercalation into black anatase.

Herein, the first prototype planar sodium‐ion microcapacitors (NIMCs) are constructed based on the interdigital microelectrodes of urchin‐like sodium titanate as faradaic anode and nanoporous activated graphene as non‐faradaic cathode along with high‐voltage ionogel electrolyte on a single flexible substrate. By effectively coupling with battery‐type anode and capacitor‐type cathode, the resultant all‐solid‐state NIMCs working at 3.5 V exhibit a high volumetric energy density of 37.1 mWh cm−3 and an ultralow self‐discharge rate of 44 h from Vmax to 0.6 Vmax, both of which surpass most reported hybrid micro‐supercapacitors. Through tuning graphene layer covered on the top surface of interdigital microelectrodes, the NIMCs unveil remarkably enhanced power density, owing to the establishment of favorable multidirectional fast ion diffusion pathways that significantly reduce the charge transfer resistance. Meanwhile, the as‐fabricated NIMCs present excellent mechanical flexibility without capacitance fade under repeated deformation, and electrochemical stability at a high temperature of 80 °C because of using nonflammable ionogel electrolyte and in‐plane geometry. Therefore, these flexible planar NIMCs with multidirectional ion diffusion pathways hold tremendous potential for microelectronics.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) are promising anode materials for sodium ion battery, thanks to their high theoretical specific capacities. Nevertheless, they suffer from large volume change and from poor conductivity during prolonged cycling. Here we systematically investigate the role of different kinds of single/multi‐wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs/MWCNTs) as additives in order to stabilize copper phosphide particles (CuP2) as anode materials in sodium ion batteries (SIBs). All composites show enhancement in the overall capacity and cycling stability compared to the pristine CuP2 due to the well‐connected CNTs on and between the CuP2 particles. At a high currency density of 1 A g−1, CuP2@SWCNTs composite with 13 wt.% SWCNTs can deliver a specific capacity over 400 mAh g−1 for more than 60 cycles, much better than conventional hard carbon materials. The CNTs enhance the conductivity and reduce capacity loss caused by the volume variation of CuP2 based electrode materials. Post‐mortem analysis by scanning electron microscopy depicts a possible battery failure mechanism, whereby the solid electrolyte interface exists in the form of nanospheres distributing at the surface of the electrode. During the repeated cycling (volume change), more fractures and cracks occur resulting in continuous interfacial reactions and consumption of sodium and electrolyte.",

        "title": "Unlocking the Potential of Iron Sulfides for Sodium-Ion Batteries by Ultrafine Pulverization.",
        "abstract": "Iron sulfides have attracted tremendous research interest for the anode of sodium-ion batteries due to their high capacity and abundant resource. However, the intrinsic pulverization and aggregation of iron sulfide electrodes induced by the conversion reaction during cycling are considered destructive and undesirable, which often impedes their capacity, rate capability, and long-term cycling stability. Herein, an interesting pulverization phenomenon of ultrathin carbon-coated Fe1- xS nanoplates (Fe1- xS@C) is observed during the first discharge process of sodium-ion batteries, which leads to the formation of Fe1- xS nanoparticles with quantum size (≈5 nm) tightly embedded in the carbon matrix. Surprisingly, no discernible aggregation phenomenon can be detected in subsequent cycles. In/ex situ experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrate that ultrafine pulverization can confer several advantages, including sustaining reversible conversion reactions, reducing the adsorption energies, and diffusion energy barriers of sodium atoms, and preventing the aggregation of Fe1- xS particles by strengthening the adsorption between pulverized Fe1- xS nanoparticles and carbon. As a result, benefiting from the unique ultrafine pulverization, the Fe1- xS@C anode simultaneously exhibits high reversible capacity (610 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1), superior rate capability (427.9 mAh g-1 at 20 A g-1), and ultralong cycling stability (377.9 mAh g-1 after 2500 cycles at 20 A g-1).",

        "abstract": "Compensating for the irreversible loss of limited active sodium (Na) is crucial for enhancing the energy density of practical sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) full-cell, especially when employing hard carbon anode with initially lower coulombic efficiency. Introducing sacrificial cathode presodiation agents, particularly those that own potential anionic oxidation activity with a high theoretical capacity, can provide additional sodium sources for compensating Na loss. Herein, Ni atoms are precisely implanted at the Na sites within Na2O framework, obtaining a (Na0.89Ni0.05□0.06)2O (Ni-Na2O) presodiation agent. The synergistic interaction between Na vacancies and Ni catalyst effectively tunes the band structure, forming moderate Ni-O covalent bonds, activating the oxidation activity of oxygen anion, reducing the decomposition overpotential to 2.8 V (vs Na/Na+), and achieving a high presodiation capacity of 710 mAh/g≈Na2O (Na2O decomposition rate >80%). Incorporating currently-modified presodiation agent with Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na2/3Ni2/3Mn1/3O2 cathodes, the energy density of corresponding Na-ion full-cells presents an essential improvement of 23.9% and 19.3%, respectively.

        "abstract": "Antimony is an attractive anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to its high theoretical capacity and appropriate sodiation potential. However, its practical application is severely impeded by its poor cycling stability caused by dramatic volumetric variations during sodium uptake and release processes. Here, to circumvent this obstacle, Sb@C@TiO2 triple-shell nanoboxes (TSNBs) are synthesized through a template-engaged galvanic replacement approach. The TSNB structure consists of an inner Sb hollow nanobox protected by a conductive carbon middle shell and a TiO2 -nanosheet-constructed outer shell. This structure offers dual protection to the inner Sb and enough room to accommodate volume expansion, thus promoting the structural integrity of the electrode and the formation of a stable solid-electrolyte interface film. Benefiting from the rational structural design and synergistic effects of Sb, carbon, and TiO2 , the Sb@C@TiO2 electrode exhibits superior rate performance (212 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 ) and outstanding long-term cycling stability (193 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 4000 cycles). Moreover, a full cell assembled with a configuration of Sb@C@TiO2 //Na3 (VOPO4 )2 F displays a high output voltage of 2.8 V and a high energy density of 179 Wh kg-1 , revealing the great promise of Sb@C@TiO2 TSNBs as the electrode in SIBs.",

The unique pie-like structure can effectively speed up the kinetics of electrode reactions, while the carbon shell stabilizes the FeS NCs inside. Studies show that the electrochemical reaction processes of P-FeS@C electrodes are dominated by the pseudocapacitive behavior, leading to an ultrafast Na+-insertion/extraction reaction. Hence, the prepared P-FeS@C nanohybrid exhibits superior Na-storage properties especially high rate capability in half cells.

Herein, a highly cross‐linked topological graphitized carbon using biomass corn cobs through a two‐step rapid thermal‐annealing strategy is reported. The topological graphitized carbon constructed with long‐range graphene nanoribbons and cavities/tunnels provides a multidirectional insertion of sodium ions whilst eliminating defects to absorb sodium ions at the high voltage region. Evidence from advanced techniques including in situ XRD, in situ Raman, and in situ/ex situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicates that the sodium ions' insertion and Na cluster formation occurred between curved topological graphite layers and in the topological cavity of adjacent graphite band entanglements. The reported topological insertion mechanism enables outstanding battery performance with a single full low‐voltage plateau capacity of 290 mAh g−1, which is almost 97% of the total capacity.",

        "abstract": "Sodium metal is regarded as an optimal anode material for high‐energy‐density sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, during the processes of sodium deposition and stripping, the failure of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film leads to the continuous accumulation of inactive sodium, thereby compromising the cycling reversibility of the battery. Here, a novel metal fluoride heterointerface layer is generated and constructed through in situ manipulation of the continuous reaction between TiF4 and metal Na. The reconstructed NaF/TiF3 interface layer, which tightly anchors the sodium metal, effectively suppresses the formation of sodium dendrites during the charge‐discharge process. The highly sodium‐philic TiF3 component exhibits strong binding with Na ions, while NaF reduces the Na+ diffusion energy barrier, significantly enhancing the reaction kinetics. Due to the successful artificial construction of this interface layer, the Na/TiF4 composite electrode demonstrates an exceptional ultra‐long cycling stability of 2370 h in symmetric cells (0.5 mAh cm−2). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further validate the functionality of each component in the Na/TiF4 protective layer. When paired with NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode in a pouch cell, it exhibits stability up to 2000 cycles at current densities of 2 C and 4 C, with a maximum energy density output of 483.1 Wh kg−1 (power density: 320.8 W kg−1).",

Herein, we propose a facile scalable approach to prepare nanostructured FeS2 embedded in an N-doped carbon nanosheet composite (FeS2/CNS) via a combined template method and a solid state sulfuration method.

Recent in situ transmission electron microscopy studies evidenced anisotropic swelling in sodiated black phosphorus, which may find an origin from the two intrinsic anisotropic properties inherent to the layered structure of black phosphorus: sodium diffusional directionality and insertion strain anisotropy. To understand the morphological evolution and stress generation in sodiated black phosphorus, we develop a chemo-mechanical model by incorporating the intrinsic anisotropic properties into the large elasto-plastic deformation. Our modeling results reveal that the apparent morphological evolution in sodiated black phosphorus is critically controlled by the coupled effect of the two intrinsic anisotropic properties. In particular, sodium diffusional directionality generates sharp interphases along the [010] and [001] directions, which constrain anisotropic development of the insertion strain. The coupled effect renders distinctive stress-generation and fracture mechanisms when sodiation starts from different crystal facets. In addition to providing a powerful modeling framework for sodiation and lithiation of layered structures, our findings shed significant light on the sodiation-induced chemo-mechanical degradation of black phosphorus as a promising anode for the next-generation sodium ion batteries.",

Mesoporous carbons, either as active materials or as hosts for guest active nanoparticles, are considered as promising electrode materials. However, addressing the issues of their short lifespan resulting from volume variation and the low coulombic efficiency caused by large surface area via a facile porous structure design still remains a challenge. Herein, a versatile phosphorus‐doped mesoporous carbon (PMC) armed is developed by graphene aerogel (GA) (GA@PMC) for hosting Na‐storage active nanoparticles. As a case study, FeSe2 nanoparticles are selectively supported onto this GA@PMC matrix, creating the FeSe2/GA@PMC composite. When employed in typical Na‐storage devices, such as Na‐ion batteries, Na‐ion hybrid capacitors, and Na‐ion based dual‐ion batteries, the FeSe2/GA@PMC electrode consistently demonstrates superior electrochemical performance. In such GA@PMC, the conformal GA can improve the entire conductivity while decreasing the specific surface area that is directly contacting with electrolyte. The interconnected macroporous structure can not only promote the diffusion of Na+ but also buffers the volume change of the guest active nanoparticles.

        "abstract": "Sodium metal batteries have attracted increasing interest recently, but suffer from severe dendrite growth caused by uneven Na plating/stripping behavior, which may result in the piercing of the membrane, with short circuiting and even cause explosions. Herein, a conductive and sodiophilic Ag coating layer is introduced to regulate Na deposition behaviors for highly reversible sodium metal batteries. Ag coated Zn foil with enhanced sodiophilicity, rapid Na+ transfer kinetics and superior electronic conductivity guarantee the homogenized Na+ ion and electric field distribution. This enables remarkably low overpotentials and uniform Na plating/stripping behavior with ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency of 99.9% during 500 cycles. As expected, the enhanced electrochemical performance of the anode-less battery and anode-free battery coupled with Prussian blue is achieved with the help of Ag coating. This work emphasizes the role of the conductive and sodiophilic coating layer in regulating the Na deposition behaviors for highly reversible sodium metal batteries.",

        "abstract": "Antimony (Sb) is considered a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries due to its high specific capacity and moderate working potential. However, the non-negligible volume variation leads to the rapid decay of capacity, which hinders the practical application of Sb anode materials. Here, an economical and scalable route with high yield is proposed to obtain Sb ultrafine nanocrystals embedded in a porous carbon skeleton. Notably, the synergetic effect of the heterogeneous structure is maximized by inducing the interfacial coupling SbOC and creating buffering space for the volume effect of Sb. The high-entropy phase interface creates the doping site breaking the periodicity of atoms and alters the electronic structure, also bridging the slip of intergranular defects. Thus, the electronic conductivity and phase interface structural stability are reinforced. The mechanism of accelerating electron migration at the heterogeneous phase interface is visualized through the density functional theory method, and the mass/charge-transfer kinetics is analyzed via the calculation of surface-induced capacitive contribution.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon is considered as one of the most promising anodes in sodium-ion batteries due to its high capacity, low cost, and abundant resources. However, the available capacity and low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) limits the practical application of hard carbon anode. This issue results from the unclear understanding of the Na+ storage mechanism in hard carbon. In this work, a series of hard carbons with different microstructures are synthesized through an \"up to down\" approach by using a simple ball-milling method to illustrate the sodium-ion storage mechanism. The results demonstrate that ball-milled hard carbon with more defects and smaller microcrystalline size shows less low-potential-plateau capacity and lower ICE, which provides further evidence to the \"adsorption-insertion\" mechanism. This work might give a new perspective to design hard carbon material with a proper structure for efficient sodium-ion storage to develop high-performance sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) antimonene is a promising anode material in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of its high theoretical capacity of 660 mAh g-1 and enlarged surface active sites. However, its Na storage properties and sodiation/desodiation mechanism have not been fully explored. Herein, we propose the sodiation/desodiation reaction mechanism of 2D few-layer antimonene (FLA) based on results acquired by in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, ex situ selected-area electron diffraction, and theoretical simulations. Our study shows that the FLA undergoes anisotropic volume expansion along the a/b plane and exhibits reversible crystalline phase evolution (Sb ⇋ NaSb ⇋ Na3Sb) during cycling. Density-functional theory calculations demonstrate that the FLA has a small Na-ion diffusion barrier of 0.14 eV. The FLA delivers a larger capacity of 642 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C (1 C = 660 mA g-1) and a high rate capability of 429 mAh g-1 at 5 C and maintains a stable capacity of 620 mA g-1 at 0.5 C with 99.7% capacity retention from the 10th to the 150th cycle. Considering the 660 mAh g-1 theoretical capacity of Sb, the electrochemical utilization of Sb atoms of FLA is as high as 93.9% at a rate of 0.5 C for over 150 cycles, which is the highest capacity and Sb utilization ratio reported so far. Our study discloses the Na storage mechanism of 2D FLA, boosting promising applications of 2D materials for advanced SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Pillared MXenes with large interlayer spacing have shown great potential as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). To better understand the underlying mechanism of the pillar effect in enhancing the electrochemical performance, first-principles calculations were used to investigate the adsorption and diffusion of Na in MXenes (Ti2CO2 and Ti3C2O2), as well as the mechanical properties of the system under different MXenes layer spacings. The results showed that when the MXene layer spacing was ∼4 Å, the strongest adsorption of Na on MXenes was achieved due to the interlayer synergy effect. However, when the MXene layer spacing was greater than 5 Å, double Na-atomic layer adsorption would be formed, which increased the Na storage capacity. Interestingly, the diffusion of Na was not only affected by the interlayer spacing of MXenes, but also by the interlayer stacking mode of MXenes. Moreover, it was found that when the MXene layer spacing was more than 8 Å, the sodium storage properties basically did not change significantly. The optimal layer spacing for Ti2CO2 and Ti3C2O2 was predicted to be 7 and 6 Å, respectively. This work provides valuable theoretical guidance for developing high-performance anode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Improving the fast-charging capabilities and energy storage capacity of electric vehicles presents a feasible strategy for mitigating the prevalent concern of range anxiety in the market. Nanostructure electrode materials play a crucial role in this process. However, the current method of preparation is arduous and yields restricted quantities. In view of this, we have devised an innovative approach that provides convenience and efficacy, facilitating the large-scale synthesis of CoS2 nanoparticles, which exhibited exceptional performance. When the current density was 1000 mA g-1, the discharging capacity reached 760 mAh g-1 after 400 cycles. Remarkably, even at an increased current density of 5000 mA g-1, the discharging capacity of CoS2 remained at 685.5 mAh g-1. The ultra-high performance could be attributed to the specific surface area, which minimized the diffusion distance of sodium-ions during the charging and discharging processes and mitigated the extent of structural damage. Our straightforward preparation techniques facilitate the mass production and present a novel approach for the development of cost-effective and high-performing anode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-metal batteries, heralded for high energy density and cost-effectiveness, are compromised by an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and dendrite formation, which hinder practical applications. Herein, a zirconium-based metal-organic framework nanostructure coating (ZMOF-NSC) was constructed in a low-loss, flexible manner. Comprehensive studies show that ZMOF-NSC, with its periodically ordered nanochannels and organized pore structures, enhances ion transport and decreases the Na+ migration energy barrier, thus ensuring uniform ion flux and achieving uniform spherical deposition. Additionally, ZMOF-NSC facilitates partial desolvation, catalyzing the formation of an inorganic-rich, dual-layered SEI that effectively protects the anode and suppresses dendrite formation. Consequently, the ZMOF-NSC@Na symmetric battery exhibits an impressive lifespan of over 2500 h, demonstrating extended operational longevity. The Na3V2(PO4)3∥ZMOF-NSC@Na batteries demonstrate exceptional cycling stability with 81% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 10 C, maintaining stability over 3000 cycles at 20 C. Moreover, the NVP∥ZMOF-NSC@Na battery achieves an energy density of 370 Wh kg-1 and a power density of 10,484 W kg-1, indicating superior durability and performance. This significant finding highlights the significant potential of structured MOFs to induce a dual-layered SEI, advancing the commercialization of durable, dendrite-free sodium metal batteries. The precise design of self-assembled pore structures and surface active sites in MOFs demonstrates significant potential in advancing the commercialization of durable, dendrite-free electrodes of metal-based rechargeable batteries.",

We report a sodium storage mechanism and properties of a new anode material, digenite Cu1.8S, based on its crystallographic study. It is revealed that copper sulfides (Cu xS) can have metal-rich formulas ( x ≥ 1.6), due to the unique oxidation state of +1 found in group 11 elements. These phases enable the unit cell to consist of all strong Cu-S bonds and no direct S-S bonds, which are vulnerable to external stress/strain that could result in bond cleavage as well as decomposition. Because of its structural rigidness, the Cu1.8S shows an intercalation/deintercalation reaction mechanism even in a low potential window of 0.1-2.2 V versus Na/Na+ without irreversible phase transformation, which most of the metal sulfides experience through a conversion reaction mechanism. It uptakes, on average, 1.4 Na+ ions per unit cell (∼250 mAh g-1) and exhibits ∼100% retention over 1000 cycles at 2C in a tuned voltage range of 0.5-2.2 V through an overall solid solution reaction with negligible phase separation.",

        "abstract": "As a potential alternative to lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted more and more attention due to the lower cost of sodium than lithium. Red phosphorus (RP) is an especially promising anode for SIBs with the highest theoretical capacity of 2596 mAh g-1, which faces the challenges of large volume change and low conductivity. Herein, we develop a nanoporous RP on reduced graphene oxide (NPRP@RGO) as a high-performance anode for SIBs through boiling. Its nanoporous structure could accommodate the volume change and minimize the ion diffusion length, and the high electronic conductive network built on RGO sheets facilitates the fast electron and ion transportation. As a result, NPRP@RGO exhibits a superhigh capacity (1249.7 mAh gcomposite-1 after 150 cycles at 173.26 mA gcomposite-1), superior rate capability (656.9 mAh gcomposite-1 at 3465.28 mA gcomposite-1), and ultralong cycle life at 5.12 A gRP-1 for RP-based electrodes (775.3 mAh gRP-1 after 1500 cycles).

        "abstract": "Unordered vacancies engineered in host anode materials cannot well maintain the uniform Na+ adsorbed and possibly render the local structural stress intense, resulting in electrode peeling and battery failure. Here, the indium is first introduced into Cu2Se to achieve the formation of CuInSe2. Next, an ion extraction strategy is employed to fabricate Cu0.54In1.15Se2 enriched with ordered vacancies by spontaneous formation of defect pairs. Such ordered defects, compared with unordered ones, can serve as myriad sodium ion micropumps evenly distributing in crystalline host to homogenize the adsorbed Na+ and the generated volumetric stress during the electrochemistry. Furthermore, Cu0.54In1.15Se2 is indeed proved by the calculations to exhibit smaller volumetric variation than the counterpart with unordered vacancies. Thanks to the distinct ordered vacancy structure, the material exhibits a highly reversible capacity of 428 mAh g−1 at 1 C and a high‐rate stability of 311.7 mAh g−1 at 10 C after 5000 cycles when employed as an anode material for Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs).

Titanium-based layered oxides have attracted widespread attention as promising anode materials due to delivering a safe potential of about 0.7 V (vs Na+/Na) and a small volume contraction during cycles; P2-type Ti-based layered oxides are typically reported, due to the challenging synthesis of the O3-type counterpart resulting from the high percentage of unstable Ti3+. Herein, we report an anomalous O3-Na2/3Ni1/3Ti2/3O2 layered oxide as an ultrastable and high-rate anode material for SIBs. The anode material delivers a reversible capacity of 112 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles at 0.1 C, a good capacity retention rate of 91% after 1400 cycles at 2 C, and, in particular, a capacity of 52 mA h g-1 even at a high rate of 20 C (1780 mA g-1). Furthermore, the in situ X-ray diffraction monitoring reveals no phase transitions and almost zero strain both underlie the good long-cycle stability. The measured high apparent Na+ diffusion coefficient (2.06 × 10-10 cm2 s-1) and the low migration energy barrier (0.59 eV) from density functional theory calculations are responsible for the superior rate capability.

However, low electronic conductivity, severe particle agglomeration and lack of effective synthesis methods have still greatly hampered their rapid development. Herein, we initially fabricate a novel VSe1.5/CNF composite through a facile electrospinning method followed by selenization. The electrochemical measurements show that VSe1.5/CNFs can enable the rapid and durable storage of Li+, Na+, and K+ ions. When used as an anode material for LIBs, the VSe1.5/CNF composite delivers a high capacity of 932 mA h g-1 after 400 cycles at a high current density of 1 A g-1. In addition, for SIBs, the VSe1.5/CNF composite manifests a high reversible capacity of 668 mA h g-1 after 50 cycles and an excellent capacity of 265 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1 even after an ultra-long 6000 cycles. This is one of the best performances of vanadium-based anode materials for SIBs reported so far. Most remarkably, the VSe1.5/CNF composite also demonstrates a satisfactory reversible K+ storage performance.

        "abstract": "Low Na+ and electron diffusion kinetics severely restrain the rate capability of MoS2 as anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Slow phase transitions between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S as well as the volume change during cycling, induce a poor cycling stability. Herein, an original Fe single atom doped MoS2 hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) is designed for the first time to address the above challenges. The Fe single atom in MoS2 promotes the electron transfer, companying with shortened charge diffusion path from unique HoMS, thereby achieving excellent rate capability. The strong adsorption with Na+ and self-catalysis of Fe single atom facilitates the reversible conversion between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S. Moreover, the buffering effect of HoMS on volume change during cycling improves the cyclic stability. Consequently, the Fe single atom doped MoS2 quadruple-shelled sphere exhibits a high specific capacity of 213.3 mAh g-1 at an ultrahigh current density of 30 A g-1, which is superior to previously-reported results. Even at 5 A g-1, 259.4 mAh g-1 (83.68 %) was reserved after 500 cycles. Such elaborate catalytic site decorated HoMS is also promising to realize other \"fast-charging\" high-energy-density rechargeable batteries.",

Systematic electrochemical studies demonstrate, as an anode of LIBs, the as-developed MoS2-rGO/HCS can deliver a reversible capacity of 1145 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 and a revisible capacity of 753 mAh g-1 over 1000 cycles at 2 A g-1. For SIBs, the as-developed MoS2-rGO/HCS can also maintain a reversible capacity of 443 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 500 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the 3D porous structures, in which the few-layer MoS2 nanosheets with expanded interlayers can provide shortened ion diffusion paths and improved Li+/Na+ diffusion mobility, and the hollow porous carbon spheres and the outside graphene network are able to improve the conductivity and maintain the structural integrity.",

The as-achieved free-standing membrane constructed by pure Sb2Se3 nanowires exhibits good flexibility and integrity.

When applied as the anode for LIBs, it delivers a reversible capacity of 614 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1, maintaining 584 mA h g-1 after 50 cycles. When applied as the anode for SIBs, it delivers a reversible capacity of 360 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1, retaining 289 mA h g-1 after 50 cycles. Such difference in electrochemical performance can be attributed to the more complex sodiation process relative to the corresponding lithiation process.

Herein, we selected a splendid host microcrystalline graphite (MG) to synthesize an AlCl3 intercalated MG intercalation compound (AlCl3-MGIC) anode material and demonstrated that it is suitable for SIBs via electrolyte optimization. The AlCl3-MGIC electrode is primarily compared in four electrolytes. Sodium storage is proposed for co-intercalation and conversion reactions by simultaneously selecting a compatible NaPF6/diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME) electrolyte. As a result, the AlCl3-MGIC anode delivers a specific capacity of 202 mA h g-1 at a current density of 0.2 A g-1 after 100 cycles and still exhibits a satisfactory capacity of 198 mA h g-1 after 900 cycles. Density functional theory calculations further illustrate that DEGDME solvent molecules offer moderate adsorption energy to sodium ions that guarantees structure stabilization of GICs during repeated cycling. This work provides a theoretical basis for designing sodium ion storage with a graphite layered structure and unveiling the prospects of MC-GIC materials as high-performance anodes.",

The anode of choice in SIBs is hard carbon (HC) due to its electrochemical performance. Among different HC precursors, bio‐waste resources have attracted significant attention due to their low‐cost, abundance, and sustainability. Many bio‐waste materials have been used as HC precursors, but they often require strong acids/bases for pre‐/post‐treatment for HC development. Here, the morphology, microstructure, and electrochemical performance of HCs synthesized from hazelnut shells subjected to different pre‐treatments (i. e., no pre‐treatment, acid treatment, and water washing) were compared. The impact on the electrochemical performance of sodium‐ion cells and the cost‐effectiveness were also investigated. The results revealed that hazelnut shell‐derived HCs produced via simple water washing outperformed those obtained via other processing methods in terms of electrochemical performance and cost–ecological effectiveness of a sodium‐ion battery pack.",

The process results in a unique pseudo-graphitic material with abundant microporosity. Electrochemical evaluations demonstrate excellent sodium storage performance by maintaining the plateau capacity even at higher current densities. This translates to a promising energy density when coupled with the cathode material.

The hard carbon produced at 1200 °C delivered the highest reversible capacity (270 mAh g–1 at 0.03 A g–1, with an acceptable initial coulombic efficiency of 71%) since a suitable balance between the pseudographitic domains growth and the retention of microporosity, defects, and functional groups was achieved.

Comprehensive characterization unraveled a three‐stage sodium storage mechanism based on adsorption, intercalation, and filling of pores. A remarkable specific capacity underestimation of up to 38% was also found when a two‐electrode half‐cell configuration was employed to measure the rate performance.

Numerous studies have been conducted on the failure mechanisms and improvement methods of Na metal batteries (NMBs) at room temperature; however, the low-temperature applications are still faced with more complex challenges. On the basis of the concentration effect of the electrolytes, we propose a dilute electrolyte for the low-temperature operation of NMBs. With the low salt concentration and tetrahydrofuran cosolvent, the affinity between Na ions and the solvent molecules is weakened to achieve fast reaction kinetics at low temperatures. The designed electrolyte enables an effectively decreased cell impedance, which improves the cycling stability of Na symmetric cells. As a result, the full cell paired with the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode maintains a capacity of 80 mAh/g over 250 cycles at -20 °C.

Results from the half-cells using two different electrolyte salts of sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI) or sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) show that NaFSI provides improved capacity retention but results from symmetrical cells disclose no advantage for either salt. The impact of high and low desodiation cut-off potentials is studied and the results show a drastic increase in capacity retention when using the desodiation cut-off potential of 1.2 V as compared to 2.5 V. This effect is clear for both NaFSI and NaPF6 salts in a 1 : 1 binary mixture of ethylene carbonate and diethylene carbonate with 10 vol% fluoroethylene carbonate. Hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) results revealed that the thickness of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) changed during cycling and that SEI was stripped from tin particles when tin phosphide was charged to 2.5 V with NaPF6 based electrolyte.",

        "abstract": "Metallic-phase iron sulfide (e.g., Fe7 S8 ) is a promising candidate for high power density sodium storage anode due to the inherent metal electronic conductivity and unhindered sodium-ion diffusion kinetics. Nevertheless, long-cycle stability can not be achieved simultaneously while designing a fast-charging Fe7 S8 -based anode. Herein, Fe7 S8 encapsulated in carbon-sulfur bonds doped hollow carbon fibers (NHCFs-S-Fe7 S8 ) is designed and synthesized for sodium-ion storage. The NHCFs-S-Fe7 S8 including metallic-phase Fe7 S8 embrace higher electron specific conductivity, electrochemical reversibility, and fast sodium-ion diffusion. Moreover, the carbonaceous fibers with polar CSFe bonds of NHCFs-S-Fe7 S8 exhibit a fixed confinement effect for electrochemical conversion intermediates contributing to long cycle life. In conclusion, combined with theoretical study and experimental analysis, the multinomial optimized NHCFs-S-Fe7 S8 is demonstrated to integrate a suitable structure for higher capacity, fast charging, and longer cycle life. The full cell shows a power density of 1639.6 W kg-1 and an energy density of 204.5 Wh kg-1 , respectively, over 120 long cycles of stability at 1.1 A g-1 . The underlying mechanism of metal sulfide structure engineering is revealed by in-depth analysis, which provides constructive guidance for designing the next generation of durable high-power density sodium storage anodes.",

        "abstract": "Developing anodes with high and stable energy density for both gravimetric and volumetric storage is vital for high-performance lithium/sodium-ion batteries. Herein, an SnSe/FLG (few-layer graphene) composite with high tap density (2.3 g cm-3) is synthesized via plasma milling method, in which SnSe nanoparticles are strongly bound with the FLG matrix, owing to both Sn-C and Se-C bonds, to form nanosized primary particles and then assemble to microsized secondary granules. The FLG can effectively alleviate the large stress generated from volume expansion of SnSe during cycling, based on its superstrength. Furthermore, as demonstrated by the density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, the Sn-C and Se-C co-bonding benefitting from the formation of substantial vacancy defects on the P-milling synthesized FLG enables strong affinity between SnSe nanoparticles and FLG matrix, preventing SnSe from aggregating and detaching even after long-term cycling. As anode for lithium-ion batteries, it exhibits high gravimetric and volumetric capacity (864.8 mAh g-1 and 1990 mAh cm-3 at 0.2 A g-1), high rate (612.6 mAh g-1 even at 5.0 A g-1) and the longest life among the reported SnSe-based anodes (capacity retention of 92.8% after 2000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1). Subsequently, impressive cyclic life (capacity retention of 91.6% after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1) is also achieved for sodium-ion batteries. Therefore, the SnSe/FLG composite is a promising anode for high-performance lithium/sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), being an attractive candidate of lithium-ion batteries, have attracted widespread attention as a result of sufficient sodium resource with low price and their comparable suitability in the field of energy storage. However, one of the main challenges for their wide-scale application is to develop suitable anode materials with excellent electrochemical performance. Herein, a novel orderly layered VMoS2 (OL-VMS) anode material was synthesized through a facile hydrothermal self-assembly approach followed by a heating procedure. As the anode material of the SIBs, the unique structure of OL-VMS not only facilitated the rapid migration of sodium ions between the stacked layers but also provided a stable framework for the volume change in the process of intercalation/deintercalation. In addition, vanadium mediating in the framework caused more defects to produce abundant storage sites for Na+. As such, the obtained OL-VMS-based anode exhibited high reversible capacities of 602.9 mAh g-1 at 0.2 mA g-1 and 534 mAh g-1 even after 190-cycle operation at 2 A g-1. Furthermore, the OL-VMS-based anode delivered an outstanding specific capacity of 626.4 mAh g-1 after 100-cycle testing at 2 A g-1 in a voltage range from 0.01 to 3 V. In particular, even in the absence of conductive carbon, it still showed an excellent specific capacity of 260 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 130 cycles in a 0.3-3 V voltage range, which should contribute to the cost reduction and energy density increase.",

        "abstract": "In this study, V5+ doped sodium titanate nanorods were successfully synthesized by a sol-gel method with different optimized vanadium concentrations. Before testing as a promising anode material for sodium ion battery (SIB) application, the samples were systematically characterized. It was clearly observed that V5+ doping significantly affects the phase formation of sodium titanate samples and leads to the alteration of the major phase of Na2Ti3O7 to a single Na2Ti6O13 phase with increasing doping concentrations. Electrochemical investigations clearly showed that the optimized 15 wt% V5+ doped sample exhibits the highest capacity of 136 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 900 cycles as well as better rate capability than the undoped sample by delivering 101 mA h g-1 capacity at a high current density of 1000 mA g-1. It is believed that the incorporation of highly charged V5+ in sodium titanate produces oxygen vacancies along with partial reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+, resulting in improved electronic conductivity. The utilization of oxygen vacancies also preserves the integrity of the electrode, giving rise to long term cycling. Thereby, V5+ doping was found to be an effective strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of the sodium titanate anode for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Inferior rate performance, insufficient cycle life, and low mass loading have restricted the practical application of hard carbon (HC) anodes in sodium-ion batteries (NIBs). Here, a compatible strategy is developed by matching HC anodes with an ether-based electrolyte. Systematical investigation reveals that good compatibility of the electrode-electrolyte systems forms thinner but a more sustainable solid-electrolyte interphase and delivers a higher ionic conductivity and Na+ ion diffusion coefficient than the commonly used ester-based electrolytes. Therefore, an excellent electrochemical performance is demonstrated with a long cycle life (∼196 mA h/g and 90% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 1 A/g), a super rate capability (∼51% capacity retention at 10 A/g) at a mass loading of 1.5 mg/cm2, and a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 85.9%. More importantly, a high reversible areal capacity of 4.3 mA h/cm2 can be achieved at an ultrahigh mass loading of 17 mg/cm2, superior to all reported HC anodes. Our findings not only shed light on the design of high-performance battery systems but also promise a commercial transformation from the lab test to mass production of NIBs.",

        "abstract": "Metal thiophosphite has demonstrated promising application potential as an anode material for sodium‐ion batteries. Nevertheless, the intrinsic low electrical conductivity and drastic volume expansion impede its commercialization. Herein, a series of metal thiophosphite/Ti3C2Tx (metal = Fe, Ni, Co, and Cd) composites are constructed via Lewis acidic molten salt etching followed by synchronous phospho‐sulfurization. The Ti3C2Tx substrate endows the thiophosphite/Ti3C2Tx hybrids with high electrical conductivity. Importantly, thiophosphite grown on the MXene layers exhibits a 3D cross‐linked structure, which not only facilitates electron/ion transport, but also maintains robust structural stability owing to the space confinement effect. As a proof of concept, FePS3/Ti3C2Tx demonstrates remarkable rate performance (827.4 and 598.1 mAh g−1 at 0.1 and 10 A g−1, respectively) along with long‐term cycling stability (capacity retention of 93.7% after 2000 cycles at 5 A g−1). Impressively, the FePS3/Ti3C2Tx//NVPO full cell exhibits a high reversible capacity of 396.8 mAh g−1 over 1350 cycles at 2 A g−1. The sodium storage mechanism of FePS3/Ti3C2Tx anode is further unveiled through in situ XRD/ex situ HRTEM characterizations and theoretical calculations.

However, as a low‐melt metal, the preparation of PSn at room temperature is a difficult problem. Herein, universal chemical prelithiation/presodiation strategies are reported to rapidly synthesize PSn from commercial Sn powders at ambient temperature. The recyclable pre‐metallation solvents are selected by redox potential analysis to react with Sn to form alloy precursors in a short time. Benefiting from the application of delithiation/desodiation agents with suitable proton concentrations, PSn perfectly inherits the Sn skeleton from precursors. With this method, porous Al, Pb, Bi, and Sb are successfully produced. Finally, the half‐cell with PSn anode prepared by presodiation strategy achieves a great rate property (663 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1) and prominent cycling performance with 71% capacity retention after 7500 cycles (502 mAh g−1) at 5 A g−1.

In the early stages of Na uptake first Cu+ is reduced and expelled from the electrode as nanocrystalline metallic Cu. An increase of the Na content leads to a full conversion of the material with nanocrystalline Cu particles and elemental V embedded in a Na2S matrix. The formation of Na2S is evidenced by 23Na MAS NMR spectra and X-ray powder diffraction. During the charge process the nanocrystalline Cu particles are retained, but no crystalline materials are formed. At later stages of cycling the reaction mechanism changes which is accompanied by the formation of copper(I) sulfide.

Here, sulfur-doped carbonized bacterial cellulose (S-CBC) was prepared as a high-performance anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) by simultaneous carbonization and sulfidation using the bacterial cellulose membrane produced by microbial fermentation as the precursor. Doping sublimed sulfur powder into CBC results in a greater degree of disorder and defects, buffering the volume expansion during the cycle. Significantly, the three-dimensional (3D) network structure of bacterial cellulose endows S-CBC with flexible self-support. As an anode for sodium ion batteries, S-CBC exhibits a high specific capacity of 302.9 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 50 cycles and 177.6 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1 after 1000 cycles. Compared with the CBC electrode, the S-CBC electrode also exhibits enhanced rate performance in sodium storage. Moreover, theoretical simulations reveal that Na+ has good adsorption stability and a faster diffusion rate in S-CBC. The doping of the S element introduces defects that enlarge the interlayer distance, and the synergies of adsorption and bonding are the main reasons for its high performance. These results indicate the potential application prospects of S-CBC as a flexible binder-free electrode for high-performance SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfides and oxides with high theoretical capacities have been regarded as promising anode candidates for a sodium-ion battery (SIB); however, they have critical issues including sluggish electrochemical kinetics and poor long-term stability. Herein, a dual carbon design strategy is proposed to integrate with highly active heterojunctions to overcome the above issues. In this new design, CoS2/CoO hollow dodecahedron heterojunctions are sandwiched between open framework carbon-spheres (OFCs) and a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanomembrane (OFC@CoS2/CoO@rGO). The CoS2/CoO heterojunctions effectively promote electron transfer on their surface and provide more electrochemical active sites through their hierarchical hollow structures assembled by nanodots. Meanwhile, the dual-carbon framework forms a highly conductive network that enables a better rate capability. More importantly, the dual carbon can greatly buffer volume expansion and stable reaction interfaces of electrode material during the charge/discharge process. Benefitting from their synergistical effects, the OFC@CoS2/CoO@rGO electrode achieves a high reversible capacity of 460 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 and still maintains 205.3 mAh g-1 even when current density is increased by 200 times when used as an anode material for SIBs. Their cycling property is also remarkable with a maintained capacity of 161 mAh g-1 after 3500 charging/discharging cycles at a high current density of 1 A g-1. The dual-carbon strategy is demonstrated to be effective for enhanced reaction kinetics and long-term cycling property, providing siginificant guidance for preparing other high-performance electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "The application of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) within grid‐scale energy storage systems (ESSs) critically hinges upon fast charging technology. However, challenges arise particularly with anodes such as hard carbon (HC), which exhibits a low working plateau (less than 0.1 V vs Na/Na+) and is susceptible to sodium dendrite issues under high current densities. In this study, a cost‐effective SIB system comprising Na2.4Fe1.8(SO4)3 (NFS) cathode, NaTi2(PO4)3 (NTP) anode, and ester‐based electrolyte is assembled to solve the fast‐charging obstacle. Benefiting from the fast sodium‐ion diffusion kinetics and relatively high voltage platform of NTP anode, this full cell can work for 10 000 cycles at 10 C rate with a notable capacity retention of 70.7%. Moreover, this investigation reveals that the full cell can operate safely between ‐50 to 90 °C even with an ester‐based electrolyte, thereby showcasing broad application prospects.

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) based on conversion‐type metal sulfide (MS) anodes have attracted extraordinary attention due to relatively high capacity and intrinsic safety. The highly reversible conversion of M/Na2S to pristine MS in charge plays a vital role with regard to the electrochemical performance. Here, taking conventional MoS2 as an example, guided by theoretical simulations, a catalyst of iron single atoms on nitrogen‐doped graphene (SAFe@NG) is selected and first used as a substrate to facilitate the reaction kinetics of MoS2 in the discharging process. In the following charging process, using a combination of spectroscopy and microscopy, it is demonstrated that the SAFe@NG catalyst enables an efficient reversible conversion reaction of Mo/Na2S→NaMoS2→MoS2. Moreover, theoretical simulations reveal that the reversible conversion mechanism shows favorable formation energy barrier and reaction kinetics, in which SAFe@NG with the Fe–N4 coordination center facilitates the uniform dispersion of Na2S/Mo and the decomposition of Na2S and NaMoS2. Therefore, efficient reversible conversion reaction MoS2↔NaMoS2↔Mo/Na2S is enabled by the SAFe@NG catalyst. This work contributes new avenues for designing conversion‐type materials with an efficient reversible mechanism.",

When utilized as the anode for sodium ion batteries, the nanohybrid material exhibits remarkable cycling performance with a high specific capacity of 420.9 mA h g-1 at the current density of 100 mA g-1 after 100 cycles, indicating that the cycling performance is strengthened by the nitrogen-doped carbon coating.

        "abstract": "Niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5) has drawn significant interest as a promising anode for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) due to its large interplanar lattice spacing and relatively high diffusion efficiency. However, the intrinsic drawbacks of low electrical conductivity and substantial volume change greatly impede its practical applications in large-scale energy storage systems. In this work, ultrasmall Nb2O5 nanoparticles wrapped with nitrogen-doped carbon (denoted as Nb2O5@NC) were delicately synthesized via a facile sol-gel method and subsequent heat treatment. The unique structure of ultrasmall Nb2O5 nanoparticles in a carbonaceous matrix can not only effectively shorten the transmission distance for both ions/electrons but also relieve the strain and stress caused by volume variation during the sodiation/desodiation process. In addition, the synergistic effect of nitrogen doping and carbon coating can further improve the electronic conductivity and pseudocapacitive behavior of the active materials, thus promoting the rapid electrochemical reaction kinetics of the Nb2O5@NC composite. The obtained 600-Nb2O5@NC-2 anode exhibits superior rate capability and outstanding cycling stability, delivering a reversible capacity of 196 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 1000 cycles. Even at high current densities of 5 A g-1 and 10 A g-1, the long-life cycling tests show that the reversible capacities still remain at 128.4 mA h g-1 and 95.9 mA h g-1 after 3000 cycles, respectively, which is the best performance of Nb2O5-based anodes at high current densities so far. These results indicate that the feasible synthetic strategy of Nb2O5@NC is an effective approach to develop high-performance Nb2O5-based anodes for large-scale energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are widely considered a hopeful alternative to lithium‐ion battery technology. However, they still face challenges, such as low rate capability, unsatisfactory cycling stability, and inferior variable‐temperature performance. In this study, a hierarchical Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) @reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/carbon nanotube (CNT) composite (NVPF@rGO/CNT) is successfully constructed. This composite features 0D Na3V2(PO4)2F3 nanoparticles are coated by a cross‐linked 3D conductive network composed of 2D rGO and 1D CNT. Furthermore, the intrinsic Na+ storage mechanism of NVPF@rGO/CNT through comprehensive characterizations is unveiled. The synthesized NVPF@rGO/CNT exhibits fast ionic/electronic transport and excellent structural stability within wide working temperatures (−40–50 °C), owing to the zero‐strain NVPF and the coated rGO/CNT conductive network that reduces diffusion distance for ions and electrons. Moreover, the stable integration between NVPF and rGO/CNT enables outstanding structural stability to alleviate strain and stress induced during the cycle. Additionally, a practice full cell is assembled employing a hard carbon anode paired with an NVPF@rGO/CNT cathode, which provides a decent capacity of 105.2 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C, thereby attaining an ideal energy density of 242.7 Wh kg−1.

Here, the concept of accurately manipulating structural evolution and formulating high‐performance heterostructured biphasic layered oxide cathodes by local chemistry and orbital hybridization modulation is reported. The P2‐structure stoichiometric composition of the cathode material shows a layered P2‐ and O3‐type heterostructure that is explicitly evidenced by various macroscale and atomic‐scale techniques. Surprisingly, the heterostructured cathode displays excellent rate performance, remarkable cycling stability (capacity retention of 82.16% after 600 cycles at 2 C), and outstanding compatibility with hard carbon anode because of the integrated advantages of intergrowth structure and local environment regulation. Meanwhile, the formation process from precursors during calcination and the highly reversible dynamic structural evolution during the Na+ intercalation/deintercalation process are clearly articulated by a series of in situ characterization techniques. Also, the intrinsic structural properties and corresponding electrochemical behavior are further elucidated by the density of states and electron localization function of density functional theory calculations. Overall, this strategy, which finely tunes the local chemistry and orbitals hybridization for high‐performance SIBs, will open up a new field for other materials.",

As a result, MnS@NSC exhibits a high reversible specific capacity of 594.2 mAh g-1 at a current density of 100 mA g-1 and an excellent rate performance. It also achieves a remarkable cycling stability of 329.1 mAh g-1 after 3000 charge/discharge cycles at 1 A g-1 corresponding to a low capacity attenuation rate of 0.0068% per cycle, which is superior to that of pristine MnS and most of the reported Mn-based anode materials in SIBs.",

Benefiting from the MxSy nanoparticles and conductive carbon, a synergistic effect of the composite has been achieved.

However, recent research findings have revealed some disadvantages in two-dimensional (2D) materials such as poor interlayer conductivity and structural instability, resulting in poor rate performance and short cycle life for SIBs. Herein, we designed MoS2 nanoflowers with an ultra-wide spacing interlayer (W-MoS2/C) anchored on special double carbon tubes to construct three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures. When tested as an anode material in a SIB, the as-prepared CNT@NCT@W-MoS2/C sample achieves high capacities (530 and 230 mA h g-1 at current densities of 0.1 and 2 A g-1, respectively). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the ultra-wide spacing MoS2/C structure is beneficial for the chemical adsorption of sodium ions and facilitates redox reactions. The wide interlayer spacing and the presence of an intermediate carbon layer provide a rapid diffusion channel for ions and offer a free space for volume expansion of the electrode material.",

The present work demonstrates a robust strategy for a variety of (Sb-C, Bi-C, Sn-C, Ge-C, Sb-Bi-C) freestanding metal-carbon framework thin films via a space-confined superassembly (SCSA) strategy. The sodium-ion battery employing the Sb-C framework exhibits an unprecedented performance with a high specific capacity of 246 mAh g-1, long life cycle (5000 cycles), and superb capacity retention (almost 100%) at a high rate of 7.5 C (3.51A g-1). Further investigation indicates that the unique framework structure enables unusual reversible crystalline-phase transformation, guaranteeing the fast and long-cyclability sodium storage.

However, the large ionic radius of sodium often leads to sluggish kinetics and large volume change, limiting the further development of SIBs. Layered MoS2, with a large interlayer distance, is a promising intercalation anode material for SIBs. In this work, we report the synthesis of methyl-functionalized MoS2 (M-MoS2) nanosheets through a facile second solvothermal method. During the second solvothermal treatment, the pristine MoS2 is mostly converted from the 2H to 1T phase and the interlayer distance is expanded from 0.65 to 0.80 nm. When evaluated as the anode for SIBs, the M-MoS2 exhibits superior cycling stability and rate capability. Kinetic analysis shows that the capacity is mainly contributed from a pseudocapacitive process. Ex situ XRD shows that the M-MoS2 exhibits inhibited lattice breathing and thus reduced volume change during cycling. This work demonstrates that the M-MoS2 is a promising candidate for pseudocapacitive sodium storage.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal chalcogenides have received great attention as promising anode candidates for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the undesirable cyclic life and inferior rate capability still restrict their practical applications. The design of micro-nano hierarchitectures is considered as a possible strategy to facilitate the electrochemical reaction kinetics and strengthen the electrode structure stability upon repeated Na+ insertion/extraction. Herein, urchin-like Fe3 Se4 hierarchitectures are successfully prepared and developed as a novel anode material for SIBs. Impressively, the as-prepared urchin-like Fe3 Se4 can present an ultrahigh rate capacity of 200.2 mAh g-1 at 30 A g-1 and a prominent capacity retention of 99.9% over 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1 , meanwhile, a respectable initial coulombic efficiency of ≈100% is achieved. Through the conjunct study of in situ X-ray diffraction, ex situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy, as well as cyclic voltammetry curves, it is intriguing to reveal that the phase transformation from monoclinic to amorphous structure accompanied by the pseudocapacitive Na+ storage behavior accounts for the superior electrochemical performance.

However, similar to other 2D materials, MXene nanosheets are inclined to stack together, limiting the device performance. In order to fully utilize MXenes' electrochemical energy storage capability, here, processing of 2D MXene flakes into hollow spheres and 3D architectures via a template method is reported. The MXene hollow spheres are stable and can be easily dispersed in solvents such as water and ethanol, demonstrating their potential applications in environmental and biomedical fields as well. The 3D macroporous MXene films are free‐standing, flexible, and highly conductive due to good contacts between spheres and metallic conductivity of MXenes. When used as anodes for sodium‐ion storage, these 3D MXene films exhibit much improved performances compared to multilayer MXenes and MXene/carbon nanotube hybrid architectures in terms of capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability. This work demonstrates the importance of MXene electrode architecture on the electrochemical performance and can guide future work on designing high‐performance MXene‐based materials for energy storage, catalysis, environmental, and biomedical applications.",

Inspired by the structure of biological cell membranes, N/P co‐doped hard carbon nanospheres (NPCS) anodes with abundant ultramicropores (≈0.6 nm) are proposed and synthesized as robust sodium anodes. Based on density functional theory calculations, optimizing ultramicropores can enable small Na+ to be well confined within the pores and hinder large solvent molecules from invading and reacting, introducing N/P species contributes to the rapid adsorption/diffusion of Na+. In situ XRD and Raman analysis suggest that the nanoconfinement strategy induced by abundant ultramicropores and N/P co‐doping enables highly reversible electrochemical reactions. Electrochemical test confirms that the nanoconfinement strategy endows the NPCS anode with high reversible capacity (376.3 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1), superior initial coulombic efficiency (87.3% at 1.0 A g−1), remarkable rate capability (155.6 mAh g−1 at 50.0 A g−1) and excellent cycling stability (with capacity retention of ≈94.6% after 10 000 cycles), lightening a promising avenue for developing SIB with robust durability.",

To meet this challenge, herein, we first propose a redox-potential-matched chemical sodiation approach, utilizing phenazine-sodium (PNZ-Na) as the optimal reagent to sodiate the Na3V2(PO4)3 precursor into Na-enriched Na4V2(PO4)3. The spontaneous sodiation reaction enables a fast reduction of one-half V ions from V3+ to V2+, followed by the insertion of one Na+ ion into the NASICON framework, which only takes 90 s to obtain the phase-pure Na4V2(PO4)3 product. When paired with a hard carbon anode, the resulting Na4VP‖HC full cell exhibits a high energy density of 251 W h kg−1, which is 58% higher than that of 159 W h kg−1 for the Na3VP‖HC control cell. Our chemical sodiation methodology provides an innovative approach for designing sodium-rich cathode materials and could serve as an impetus to the development of advanced sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Carbon materials with large capacity and low potential serve as promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Carbon defects offer active sites for sodium storage but sacrifice reversibility, whereas carbon microcrystals improve conductivity but may suffer from low capacity. Herein, the balance between defects and microcrystals is realized by the molecular chemistry method of cross-linking and defect repairing. Real-time spectroscopic analyses reveal that the decomposition of tetrabromophthalic anhydride (TBPA) molecule induces the dehydrogenation of pitch to release small gas molecules to form pseudo-closed pores, followed by the cross-linking of C═O bonds in TBPA with the dehydrogenated pitch to form C─O─C bonds and thus suppress the excessive microcrystal growth. Meanwhile, the decomposition products of TBPA can also react with the dehydrogenated pitch to repair carbon defects. Thanks to the microstructure balance, the as-synthesized carbon material exhibits a smoother ion mass transfer channel (d(002) = 0.386 nm, La = 4.56 nm) and a larger storage space (Vpseudo-closed pore = 0.086 cm3 g-1) than the pitch carbon (PC, d(002) = 0.349 nm, La = 5.90 nm, Vpseudo-closed pore = 0.041 cm3 g-1), increasing the capacity from 162.5 to 336.5 mAh g-1.

This facile and cost-effective method is quite universal and holds potential to be further extended to other metal phosphide materials. Significantly, the hybrid nanosheet electrode possesses excellent sodium storage properties as anodes for SIBs, including high specific capacity, an ultra-long cycle life and a remarkable rate performance.

        "abstract": "Two new structural forms of Na xCo0.5Ti0.5O2, the layered O3- and P3-forms, were synthesized and comprehensively characterized. Both materials show electrochemical activity as electrodes in Na-ion batteries. During cell charging (desodiation of the Na xCo0.5Ti0.5O2 cathode), we observed a structural phase transformation of O3-Na0.95Co0.5Ti0.5O2 into P3-Na xCo0.5Ti0.5O2, whereas no changes other than conventional unit cell volume shrinkage were detected for P3-Na0.65Co0.5Ti0.5O2. During Na insertion (cell discharging), the reconversion of the P3-form into O3-Na xCo0.5Ti0.5O2 was impeded for both materials and occurs well below 1 V versus Na+/Na only. The reconversion is hindered by the charge and spin transfers of Co (LS-Co3+ → HS-Co2+) and by a significant unit cell volume expansion at the P3 → O3 transformation, as revealed from the magnetization, crystallographic, and spectroscopic studies. As the kinetics of such transformations depend on numerous parameters such as time, temperature, and particle size, a large cell overpotential ensues. An extended cutoff voltage at 0.2 V versus Na+/Na during discharging allows to complete the P3 → O3 transformation and increases the specific discharging capacity to 200 mA h g-1. Moreover, a quasi-symmetrical full cell, based on the O3- and P3-forms, was designed, eliminating safety concerns associated with sodium anodes and delivering a discharge capacity of 130 mA h g-1.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal phosphides have been extensively investigated owing to their high theoretical capacities and relatively low intercalation potentials vs Li/Li+, but their practical applications have been hindered by low electrical conductivity and dramatic volume variation during cycling. In this work, an interesting strategy for the rational design of graphene (GR) encapsulated with a hollow FeP@carbon nanocomposite (H-FeP@C@GR) via a combination of a hydrothermal route, a carbon-coating process, phosphidation treatment, and carbothermic reaction is reported. The hollow FeP (H-FeP) nanospheres shelled with thin carbon layers are wonderfully incorporated into the GR matrix, interconnecting to form a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical architecture. Such a design offers distinct advantages for FeP-based anode materials for both lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium ion batteries (SIBs). For example, the 3D omnibearing conductive networks from the GR skeleton and outer coating carbon can provide an open freeway for electron/ion transport, promoting the electrode reaction kinetics. In addition, the wrapping of an H-FeP nanosphere in a thin carbon layer enables the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the carbon layer surface instead of on the individual H-FeP surface, preventing the continual re-forming of the SEI. When used as anode materials for LIBs and SIBs, H-FeP@C@GR exhibited excellent electrochemistry performances.",

        "abstract": "Sodium (Na)-ion capacitors possess higher energy density than supercapacitors and higher power density than Na-ion batteries. However, kinetic mismatches between fast capacitive charge storage on the cathode and sluggish battery-type reactions on the anode lead to a poor charge/discharge rate capability and insufficient power output of Na-ion capacitors. Thus, developing suitable anode materials for Na-ion capacitors is urgently desirable. This work demonstrates an electrochemically exfoliated graphite (EEG) anode with enhanced capacitive charge storage, greatly boosting the Na-ion reaction kinetics of co-intercalation. The EEG anode shows a high reversible capacity of 109 mAh g-1 and maintains a good capacity retention of 90% after 1000 cycles. The assembled Na-ion capacitor using the EEG anode can finish the charge/discharge process in less than 10 s, which achieves an ultrahigh power density of 17,500 W kg-1 with an energy density of 17 Wh kg-1. The high capacitive contributions at both the anode and cathode contribute to the fast rate capability and high power output of the fabricated Na-ion capacitors. This work will promote the development of ultrafast charging sodium-ion storage devices.",

However, finding an anode material that can overcome the sluggish electrochemical reaction kinetics and fast capacity fading caused by large volume expansion during cycling is problematic. In this study, the intercalation technique for nitrogen-doped carbon layers is implemented for the molybdenum disulfide (MoS2/NC) structure to improve the rate and cycling stability of SIBs by increasing the diffusion rate of sodium ions and mitigating excessive volume structural expansion.

One of the key obstacles to sodium batteries is the lack of efficient and stable anode materials. Compared with traditional inorganic electrode materials, organic materials are more attractive because of their easier sodium transport accessibility and the diversities of organic frameworks and functional groups. In this work, two molecules (Na-CPN and Na-CPP) were synthesized and used as anode materials for SIBs. Structurally, the two compounds are isomers, and they are distinguished by the position of N atoms in phenylpyridine. Na-CPP provides a high reversible capacity of 197 mAh g -1 , excitingly, its capacity could maintain 99.1% even after 350 cycles of 100 mA g -1 . Moreover, after going through 1200 cycles at a current density of 5C, the Na-CPP electrode still retain a capacity rate of 89.9%. These results are impressive. In contrast, Na-CPN exhibited inferior capacity performance and rate performance for its larger polarization, particle size and charge transporting resistance.",

        "abstract": "Interface stability is a key to practical applications of high‐rate sodium metal batteries (SMBs). The general sodium metal anode (SMA), for example, suffers from an unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI), which may induce severe dendrite growth and continuous Na consumption, particularly under high rates. At the same time, the cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) of a widely adopted cathode material Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) has to tolerate the massive volume changes during the rapid Na+ ion intercalation/extraction, resulting in structural degradations and the capacity loss. Here, a facile strategy is reported by introducing aluminum ethoxide to a conventional ether‐based electrolyte, to promote the formation of an alumina‐rich SEI and CEI, which facilitates the rapid Na+ ion transport across the interface and promotes the uniform Na deposition. The resultant Na || Na symmetric cell demonstrates a stable cycling of 4800 h at 10 mA cm−2 and 1 mAh cm−2, and a Na || NVP full cell exhibits a high capacity retention of 81.28% after 6000 cycles at 40C.

Herein, we have reported gallium sulfide (Ga2S3) as a novel SIB anode material for the first time. Ga2S3 nanorods have been synthesized via the facile hydrothermal preparation of a GaOOH precursor with subsequent H2S annealing. Mixed with graphene upon electrode preparation, this Ga2S3 electrode maintains a reversible specific capacity of 476 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.4 A g-1, with a coulombic efficiency of over 99%. Ex situ XRD analysis and theoretical calculations are employed to comprehensively elucidate the detailed sodium ion storage mechanism of Ga2S3, which is composed of initial Na+ intercalation, a subsequent multi-step conversion reaction between S and Na+, and an eventual alloying reaction between Ga and Na+ with the end product of Na7Ga13. Further kinetics analysis has demonstrated that the conversion reaction is the rate-limiting step due to a multi-step reaction with the intermediate phase of GaS. Moreover, the appearance of liquid metal Ga, as confirmed via TEM observations and theoretical calculations, can serve as a self-healing agent that repairs cracks in the electrode. Our findings shed light on the further design of Ga-based materials, and they also can be extended to solid-state-battery systems.",

The all‐around encapsulation (plane‐to‐plane contact) architecture that provides a large interface between N‐graphene and SnSb nanocrystal not only effectively enhances the electron conductivity and structural integrity of the overall electrode, but also offers excess interfacial sodium storage, thus leading to much enhanced high‐rate sodium storage capacity and stability, which has been proven by both experimental results and first‐principles simulations. Moreover, this top‐down strategy can enable new paths to the low‐cost and high‐yield synthesis of 3D graphene/metal composites for applications in energy‐related fields and beyond.",

        "title": "Dual-Function Presodiation with Sodium Diphenyl Ketone towards Ultra-stable Hard Carbon Anodes for Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries, yet still suffers from low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, sodium diphenyl ketone (Na-DK) is applied to realize dual-function presodiation for HC anodes. It compensates the irreversible Na uptake at the oxygen-containing functional groups and reacts with carbon defects of five/seven-membered rings for quasi-metallic sodium in HC. The as-formed sodium induces robust NaF-rich SEI on HC in 1.0 M NaPF6 in diglyme, favoring the interfacial reaction kinetics and stable Na+ insertion and extraction. This renders the presodiated HC (pHC) with high ICE of ~100% and capacity retention of 82.4% after 6800 cycles. It is demonstrated to couple with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathodes in full cells to show high capacity retention of ~100% after 700 cycles. This work provides in-depth understanding of chemical presodiation and a new strategy for highly stable sodium-ion batteries.",

        "title": "Lignin‐derived hard carbon anode with a robust solid electrolyte interphase for boosted sodium storage performance",
        "abstract": "Hard carbon is regarded as a promising anode candidate for sodium‐ion batteries due to its low cost, relatively low working voltage, and satisfactory specific capacity. However, it still remains a challenge to obtain a high‐performance hard carbon anode from cost‐effective carbon sources. In addition, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is subjected to continuous rupture during battery cycling, leading to fast capacity decay. Herein, a lignin‐based hard carbon with robust SEI is developed to address these issues, effectively killing two birds with one stone. An innovative gas‐phase removal‐assisted aqueous washing strategy is developed to remove excessive sodium in the precursor to upcycle industrial lignin into high‐value hard carbon, which demonstrated an ultrahigh sodium storage capacity of 359 mAh g−1. It is found that the residual sodium components from lignin on hard carbon act as active sites that controllably regulate the composition and morphology of SEI and guide homogeneous SEI growth by a near‐shore aggregation mechanism to form thin, dense, and organic‐rich SEI. Benefiting from these merits, the as‐developed SEI shows fast Na+ transfer at the interphases and enhanced structural stability, thus preventing SEI rupture and reformation, and ultimately leading to a comprehensive improvement in sodium storage performance.",

        "title": "Revealing Electrochemical Process of Functional Carbon Dots Stabilized Sodium Metal Anode: Co‐Deposition and Strengthened SEI Films",
        "abstract": "Sodium metal batteries with high theoretical energy density and low redox potential possess vast application prospects. However, the inevitable side reactions between Na metal anode and electrolyte, the formation of Na dendrite during cycling, and the uneven electric field distribution at the interface will lead to a decrease in the cycling stability of the battery. Herein, N and S co‐doped carbon dots are employed as electrolyte additives in view of their quantum size, excellent dispersion, and polar surface functional groups. It is found that the quantum‐sized carbon core and sodiophilic surface functional groups of N,S‐CDs enable the homogenous deposition of Na+ and the involvement of N,S‐CDs in the formation of solid electrolyte film. The N,S‐CDs co‐deposition guarantees the uniform sodium plating in the initial cycle, avoiding the routine dendrite growth. The strength and stability of SEI are boosted with the assistance of inorganics such as Na3N and Na2S, which accelerate the transport of Na+ flux and realize rapid charge transfer at the interface, ensuring high reversibility of sodium ion plating/stripping. Na||Cu half‐cells achieve a coulombic efficiency of 99% after 250 cycles under 1.0 mA cm−1, and Na||Na symmetric cells continuously cycle over 1200 h at a current density of 1 mA cm−2.",

        "title": "High‐abundance and low‐cost anodes for sodium‐ion batteries",
        "abstract": "Nowadays, sodium‐ion batteries are considered the most promising large‐scale energy storage systems (EESs) due to the low cost and wide distribution of sodium sources as well as the similar working principle to lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs). Therefore, screening suitable materials with high abundance, low cost, and excellent reliability and modified with different strategies based on them is the key point for the development of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). In addition, the ideal anodes with high abundance, and low cost elements also greatly influence the cost of SIB systems, determining the large‐scale application. Herein, recent advances in carbon, iron, manganese, and phosphorus‐based anodes of various types, such as hard carbon, iron oxides, manganese oxides, and red phosphorus, are highlighted. The various sodium storage mechanisms and structure‐function properties for these four types of materials are summarized and analyzed in detail. Considering the commercial profits that the EESs can bring and their suitability for mass electrode manufacturing, the participation of high‐abundance and low‐cost elements such as Fe, Mn, C, and P is convincing and encouraging.",

        "title": "A Multifunctional Interphase Layer Enabling Superior Sodium‐Metal Batteries under Ambient Temperature and −40 °C",
        "abstract": "The sodium (Na)‐metal anode with high theoretical capacity and low cost is promising for construction of high‐energy‐density metal batteries. However, the unsatisfactory interface between Na and the liquid electrolyte induces tardy ion transfer kinetics and dendritic Na growth, especially at ultralow temperature (−40 °C). Herein, an artificial heterogeneous interphase consisting of disodium selenide (Na2Se) and metal vanadium (V) is produced on the surface of Na (Na@Na2Se/V) via an in situ spontaneous chemical reaction. Such interphase layer possesses high sodiophilicity, excellent ionic conductivity, and high Young's modulus, which can promote Na‐ion adsorption and transport, realizing homogenous Na deposition without dendrites. The symmetric Na@Na2Se/V cell exhibits outstanding cycling life span of over 1790 h (0.5 mA cm−2/1 mAh cm−2) in carbonate‐based electrolyte. More remarkably, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the artificial Na2Se/V hybrid interphase can accelerate the desolvation of solvated Na+ at −40 °C. The Na@Na2Se/V electrode thus exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance in symmetric cell (over 1500 h at 0.5 mA cm−2/0.5 mAh cm−2) and full cell (over 700 cycles at 0.5 C) at −40 °C. This work provides an avenue to design artificial heterogeneous interphase layers for superior high‐energy‐density metal batteries at ambient and ultralow temperatures.",

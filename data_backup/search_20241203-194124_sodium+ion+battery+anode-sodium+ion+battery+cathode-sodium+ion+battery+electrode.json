        "abstract": "Rechargeable solid-state Na metal batteries (SSNMB) can offer high operational safety and energy density. However, poor solid-solid contact between the electrodes and the electrolyte can dramatically increase interfacial resistance and Na dendrite formation, even at low current rates. Therefore, we developed a carbon-fiber-supported liquid Na-K alloy anode that ensures close anode-electrolyte contact, enabling superior cycle stability and rate capability. We then demonstrated the first cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) characterization of an SSNMB, capturing the evolution of solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) and revealing both crystalline and amorphous phases, which could facilitate ion transport and prevent continuous side reactions. By enhancing contact between the Na-K alloy and solid-state electrolyte, these symmetric cells are capable of cycling for over 800 h without notable increased polarization and enable an unprecedented critical current density (CCD) at 40 mA cm-2. Our liquid Na-K alloy approach offers a promising strategic avenue toward commercial SSNMBs.",

        "abstract": "While lithium resources are scarce for high energy‐dense lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), serving as an alternative, inherently suffer from low capacity and the high‐cost use of non‐graphite anodes. Combining Li‐ and Na‐ions within a single battery system is expected to mitigate the shortcomings of both systems while leveraging their respective advantages. In this study, we developed and assembled a nanodiamonds (NDs)‐assisted co‐Li/Na‐ion battery (ND–LSIB). This innovative battery system comprised a commercial graphite anode, an ND‐modified polypropylene (DPP) separator, a hybrid lithium/sodium‐based electrolyte, and a cathode. It is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that the ND/Li co‐insertion can serve as an ion‐drill opening graphite layers and reconstructing graphite anodes into few‐layered graphene with expanding interlayer space, achieving highly efficient Li/Na storage and the theoretical maximum of LiC6 for Li storage in graphite. In addition, ND is helpful for creating a LiF‐/NaF‐rich hybrid solid electrolyte interface with improved ionic mobility, mechanical strength, and reversibility. Consequently, ND–LSIBs have higher specific capacities ~1.4 times the theoretical value of LIBs and show long‐term cycling stability. This study proposes and realizes the concept of Li/Na co‐storage in one ion battery with compatible high‐performance, cost‐effectiveness, and industrial prospects.",

        "abstract": "Rational construction of nanosized anode nanomaterials is crucial to enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium-/sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs). Various anode nanoparticles are created mainly via templating surface confinement, or encapsulation within precursors (such as metal-organic frameworks). Herein, low-content SnO2 nanodots on N-doped reduced graphene oxide (SnO2@N-rGO) were prepared as anode nanomaterials for LIBs and SIBs, via a distinctive lattice confinement of a CoAlSn-layered double hydroxide (CoAlSn-LDH) precursor. The SnO2@N-rGO composite exhibits the advantagous features of low-content (17.9 wt%) and uniform SnO2 nanodots (3.0 ± 0.5 nm) resulting from the lattice confinement of the Co and Al species to the surrounded Sn within the same crystalline layer, and high-content conductive rGO. The SnO2@N-rGO composite delivers a highly reversible capacity of 1146.2 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 for LIBs, and 387 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 for SIBs, outperforming N-rGO. Furthermore, the dominant capacitive contribution and the rapid electronic and ionic transfer, as well as small volume variation, all give rise to the enhancement. Precursor-based lattice confinement could thus be an effective strategy for designing and preparing uniform nanodots as anode nanomaterials for electrochemical energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Metallic selenides have been widely investigated as promising electrode materials for metal-ion batteries based on their relatively high theoretical capacity. However, rapid capacity decay and structural collapse resulting from the larger-sized Na+ /K+ greatly hamper their application. Herein, a bimetallic selenide (MoSe2 /CoSe2 ) encapsulated in nitrogen, sulfur-codoped hollow carbon nanospheres interconnected reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (rGO@MCSe) are successfully designed as advanced anode materials for Na/K-ion batteries. As expected, the significant pseudocapacitive charge storage behavior substantially contributes to superior rate capability. Specifically, it achieves a high reversible specific capacity of 311 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 in NIBs and 310 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 in KIBs. A combination of ex situ X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy tests reveals the phase transition of rGO@MCSe in NIBs/KIBs. Unexpectedly, they show quite different Na+ /K+ insertion/extraction reaction mechanisms for both cells, maybe due to more sluggish K+ diffusion kinetics than that of Na+ . More significantly, it shows excellent energy storage properties in Na/K-ion full cells when coupled with Na3 V2 (PO4 )2 O2 F and PTCDA@450 °C cathodes. This work offers an advanced electrode construction guidance for the development of high-performance energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "Development of the next-generation, high-energy-density, low-cost batteries will likely be fueled by sodium (Na) metal batteries because of their high capacity and the abundance of Na. However, their practical application is significantly plagued by the hyper-reactivity of Na metal, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and dendritic Na growth, leading to continuous electrolyte decomposition, low Coulombic efficiency, large impedance, and safety concerns. Herein, we add a small amount of SnCl2 additive in a common carbonate electrolyte so that the spontaneous reaction between SnCl2 and Na metal enables in situ formation of a Na-Sn alloy layer and a compact NaCl-rich SEI. Benefitting from this design, rapid interfacial ion transfer is realized and direct exposure of Na metal to the electrolyte is prohibited, which jointly achieve a nondendritic deposition morphology and a markedly reduced voltage hysteresis in a Na/Na symmetric cell for over 500 h. The Na/SnCl2-added electrolyte/Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell exhibits high capacity retention over cycling and excellent rate capability (101 mAh/g at 10 C).

        "abstract": "Sluggish reaction kinetics induced by the inferior solid-state ion diffusion and poor conductivity of electrode materials currently conflict with increasing fast-charge needs for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) based on conversion mechanism. Herein, mesoporous, conductive, thin-wall three-dimension (3D) skeletons of molybdenum nitride (meso-Mo2N) were established and employed as anodes to facilitate rate performance for SIBs. Mesoporous channels (～9.3 nm) with very thin walls (＜8 nm) and conductive networks in meso-Mo2N enable the rapid Na+/Li+ infiltrability/diffusivity and smooth electron transfer, respectively. The fast ion diffusion/transfer ability is confirmed by galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, cyclic voltammetry tests with higher ion-diffusion dominated capacity and larger Na+ diffusion coefficient. Consequently, meso-Mo2N exhibited a superior rate capability and a stable specific capacity of 158 mAh g-1 (after 1000 cycles) at 1 A g-1 for SIBs, surpassing nonporous Mo2N and even the previously reported Mo2N. Furthermore, the proof of concept can be also extended to enhanced Li storage. Such mesostructured design with 3D mesoporous, conductive thin wall of electrodes is a promising strategy for achieving fast-charging and high-performance Na/Li storage.",

        "abstract": "We systematically investigated the potential of single-layer VS2 polytypes as Na-battery anode materials via density functional theory calculations. We found that sodiation tends to inhibit the 1H-to-1T structural phase transition, in contrast to lithiation-induced transition on monolayer MoS2. Thus, VS2 can have better structural stability in the cycles of charging and discharging. Diffussion of Na atom was found to be very fast on both polytypes, with very small diffusion barriers of 0.085 eV (1H) and 0.088 eV (1T). Ab initio random structure searching was performed in order to explore stable configurations of Na on VS2. Our search found that both the V top and the hexagonal center sites are preferred adsorption sites for Na, with the 1H phase showing a relatively stronger binding. Notably, our random structures search revealed that Na clusters can form as a stacked second layer at full Na concentration, which is not reported in earlier works wherein uniform, single-layer Na adsorption phases were assumed. With reasonably high specific energy capacity (232.91 and 116.45 mAh/g for 1H and 1T phases, respectively) and open-circuit voltage (1.30 and 1.42 V for 1H and 1T phases, respectively), VS2 is a promising alternative material for Na-ion battery anodes with great structural sturdiness. Finally, we have shown the capability of the ab initio random structure searching in the assessment of potential materials for energy storage applications.",

The optimized P-Bi@C-700 (annealed at 700 °C) demonstrates 359.8 mAh g-1 after 1500 cycles at 1 A g-1.

        "abstract": "Carbon materials are widely used for reversible lithium uptake in the anode of lithium-ion batteries. Nevertheless, the challenge of uncontrollable dendrite deposition during fast charge-discharge cycles remains a grand hurdle. Various strategies have been explored to prevent detrimental heterogeneous dendrite metal deposits, such as interface engineering and electrolyte modification, but they often compromise the reverse diffusion freedom of Li+ ions during discharging and are incompatible with the most mainstream use of graphite as an anode material. Here, we propose the incorporation of a novel carbon allotrope of cyclocarbon as a potential additive in the anode. In contrast to conventional carbon materials, density functional theory calculations reveal that cyclocarbon has a much higher affinity for Li atoms than Li+ ions, even surpassing the inherent cohesion of Li atoms, due to the charge transfer from the 2s orbital of Li atoms to the unique in-plane π orbital of cyclocarbon. Furthermore, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that Li+ ions can shuttle freely back and forth across cyclocarbon, whereas the lithiation process for Li atoms occurs rapidly within picoseconds. The delithiation of Li atoms within cyclocarbon follows a voltage-gated mechanism that is effectively controlled by an external electric field of 3 V nm-1. Remarkably, cyclocarbon exhibits potential compatibility with commercialized graphite electrodes via the π-π interaction and also can be extended to sodium-ion and potassium-ion batteries. These distinct compatibility, scalability and electrochemical properties of cyclocarbon provide a new avenue to realize both safety and ultrafast rechargeable performance of ion batteries.",

However, 1T‐MoS2 is thermodynamically unstable and prone to phase transition to the 2H‐MoS2 phase. Herein, self‐supporting nitrogen‐doped and carbon‐coated 1T/2H mixed‐phase MoS2 nanosheets with rich sulfur vacancies on carbon cloth (C@N‐MoS2‐p/CC) are synthesized through a hydrothermal method and Ar/NH3 radio‐frequency (RF) plasma treatment process. Density‐functional‐theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that after Ar/NH3 RF plasma treatment, nitrogen‐doping and etching effects are realized, which combine with carbon‐coating significantly reduce the phase transition energy of 1T‐MoS2, thus triggering the phase transition and enabling the stable existence of the highly active 1T‐MoS2. As a result, the C@N‐MoS2‐p/CC exhibits outstanding sodium storage performance, with initial charge–discharge capacities of 701.0/797.0 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1, respectively. It also demonstrates exceptional rate capabilities and ultra‐high cyclic stability, maintaining a discharge capacity of 404.2 mAh g−1 after 910 cycles at a high rate of 2 A g−1. In a full cell with Na3V2(PO4)3/CC cathode, it exhibits excellent initial charge–discharge capacities of 102.3/102.9 mAh g−1 and maintains satisfactory cycling stability after 350 cycles (86.7 mAh g−1) at 0.1 C.",

        "abstract": "Lignin-derived porous carbons have great potential for energy storage applications. However, their traditional synthesis requires highly corrosive activating agents in order to produce porous structures. In this work, an environmentally friendly and unique method has been developed for preparing lignin-based 3D spherical porous carbons (LSPCs). Dropwise injection of a lignin solution containing PVA sacrificial templates into liquid nitrogen produces tiny spheres that are lyophilized and carbonized to produce LSPCs. Most of the synthesized samples possess excellent specific surface areas (426.6–790.5 m2/g) along with hierarchical micro- and mesoporous morphologies. When tested in supercapacitor applications, LSPC-28 demonstrates a superior specific capacitance of 102.3 F/g at 0.5 A/g, excellent rate capability with 70.3% capacitance retention at 20 A/g, and a commendable energy density of 2.1 Wh/kg at 250 W/kg. These materials (LSPC-46) also show promising performance as an anode material in sodium-ion batteries with high reversible capacity (110 mAh g–1 at 100 mA g–1), high Coulombic efficiency, and excellent cycling stability. This novel and green technique is anticipated to facilitate the scalability of lignin-based porous carbons and open a range of research opportunities for energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "The binder's choice holds immense significance in the quest for robust electrochemical performances of lithium/sodium‐ion battery's (LIB/SIB) electrodes. Conventional PVDF binder is a passive polymer lacking the ability to transport Li+/Na+ and facilitate ion kinetics. This limitation poses constraints in achieving high specific capacity, fast charging, and long cycle life. Herein, a novel water‐soluble concentrated imidazolium functionalized poly(ionic liquid), poly(oxycarbonylmethylene 1‐allyl‐3‐methyimidazolium) (PMAI) is synthesized, and evaluated it as binder in LIB/SIB. PMAI‐based anodic‐half cell exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, achieving higher capacities (297 mAhg−1 at 1C for LIBs and 250 mAhg−1 at 60 mAg−1 for SIBs) and good cycle stability (80 % capacity retention after 750 cycles for LIBs; 96% capacity retention after 200 cycles for SIBs), compared to PVDF binder. In addition, PMAI/Gr delivers a higher discharge capacity of 85 mAhg−1 than PVDF/Gr with 47 mAhg−1 at 5C. PMAI‐containing electrodes show better rate capability at different current densities than PVDF binder in LIB/SIB. The enhanced ion diffusion coefficient, lower resistance and decreased activation energy of desolvation, are ascribed to densely polar ionic liquid groups along the polymer and formation of a functionalized SEI via binder reduction. The novel PMAI binder's design and full‐cell examination confirm its potential in secondary‐ion battery applications.",

In this work, a facile strategy is employed to successfully synthesize porous CoxP hierarchical nanostructures supported on a flexible carbon fiber cloth (CoxP@CFC), constructing a robust architecture of ordered nanoarrays. Via such a unique design, porous and bare structures can thoroughly expose the electroactive surfaces to the electrolyte, which is favorable for ultrafast sodium‐ion storage. In addition, the CFC provides an interconnected 3D conductive network to ensure firm electrical connection of the electrode materials. Besides the inherent flexibility of the CFC, the integration of the hierarchical structures of CoxP with the CFC, as well as the strong synergistic effect between them, effectively help to buffer the mechanical stress caused by repeated sodiation/desodiation, thereby guaranteeing the structural integrity of the overall electrode. Consequently, CoxP@CFC as an anode shows a record‐high capacity of 279 mAh g−1 at 5.0 A g−1 with almost no capacity attenuation after 9000 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Featuring a high theoretical capacity, low cost, and abundant resources, sodium metal has emerged as an ideal anode material for sodium ion batteries. However, the real feasibility of sodium metal anodes is still hampered by the uncontrolled sodium dendrite problems. Herein, an artificial three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical porous sodiophilic V2CTx/rGO-CNT microgrid aerogel is fabricated by a direct-ink writing 3D printing technology and further adopted as the matrix of Na metal to deliver a Na@V2CTx/rGO-CNT sodium metal anode. Upon cycling, the V2CTx/rGO-CNT electrode can yield a superior cycling life of more than 3000 h (2 mA cm-2, 10 mAh cm-2) with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.54%. More attractively, it can even sustain a stable operation over 900 h at 5 mA cm-2 with an ultrahigh areal capacity of 50 mAh cm-2. In situ and ex situ characterizations and density functional theory simulation analyses prove that V2CTx with abundant sodiophilic functional groups can effectively guide the sodium metal nucleation and uniform deposition, thus enabling a dendrite-free morphology. Moreover, a full cell pairing a Na@V2CTx/rGO-CNT anode with a Na3V2(PO4)3@C-rGO cathode can deliver a high reversible capacity of 86.27 mAh g-1 after 400 cycles at 100 mA g-1.

        "abstract": "The shortage of high-capacity anode materials with long cycling stability is the main roadblock to the development of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The advantages of transition metal selenides are high theoretical capacity, safety and ease of design, which gradually make them potential substitute materials for the anodes of a new generation of SIBs. However, the low intrinsic conductivity of transition metal selenides and the serious powderization during charge and discharge processes restrict their rate performance and cycling stability in SIBs. Herein, bimetallic selenide ZnSe/MoSe2@NC is fabricated by in situ selenation of a rhombic dodecahedron structured metal-organic framework (MOF) containing Zn/Mo salt. Such a heterojunction and structural regulation effectively promote sodium ion transportation. Furthermore, the porous and hierarchical ZnSe/MoSe2@NC is capable of adapting to the volume stress generated by sodium ion (de)insertion. Specifically, in SIB half-cell measurement, a comparable capacity of 401.8 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 1 A g-1 can be achieved by ZnSe/MoSe2@NC. Additionally, the ZnSe/MoSe2@NC polyhedron delivers a high capacity of 345.7 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1 (1500 cycles). Electrochemical kinetics analysis is performed in detail. In SIB full battery applications, the cell shows an impressive energy density of 175.1 W h kg-1. This research broadens the development prospect of transition metal selenides as anodes in SIBs.",

DFT simulations revealed that both pyridinic and pyrrolic NGs enhanced Na adsorption even at higher Na concentrations by introducing electron-deficient vacancies. While Na ions tend to cluster on a pristine graphene, they separate when absorbed on pyridinic NGs due to stronger Na adsorption and Na-Na repulsion. Based on DFT energies, MC simulations were performed to study the distribution of Na on a pyridinic NG as a function of the pyridinic defect concentration and Na concentration. The average size of Na clusters decreases with increasing pyridinic defect concentration. The theoretical specific capacity increases monotonically as the pyridinic defect concentration is increased and reaches a maximum value at a concentration of ~7.5%. This theoretical study suggests that the pyridinic NGs hold promise as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries capable of enhancing Na adsorption, preventing Na clustering, and increasing the anode’s specific capacity.",

        "abstract": "Non-uniform zinc plating/stripping in aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) often leads to dendrites formation and low Coulombic efficiency (CE), limiting their large-scale application. In this study, a pre-corroded Zn (PC-Zn) anode with 3D ridge-like structure is constructed by a facile solution etching in sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2) solution. The surface preparation process can significantly remove impurities from the passivation layer of bare Zn anode, thus exposing a great quantity of active sites for easy plating/stripping. Moreover, the pre-corroded structure enables a uniform-distributed electric field to promote the 3D Zn2+ diffusion process and accelerate the transfer kinetics, thereby suppressing the zinc dendrites and interfacial side reactions. Consequently, symmetric cells with PC-Zn electrodes demonstrate remarkable stability, maintaining cycles for over 3200 h under 1 mA cm-2. The PC-Zn/VO2 full cell maintains a specific capacity of 361 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, and a capacity retention rate of ≈80% over 1000 cycles at 4 A g-1. Notably, no obvious dendrites and side reactions are detected after extended cycling.

Herein, a defect engineering strategy for the in situ encapsulation of single‐phase ternary iron phosphoselenide into porous carbon by robust chemical bonds with the formation of rod‐like multicavity nanohybrids (FePSe3@C) is presented.

The electrode composition is especially crucial for conversion reaction-based materials where the composite electrode (active material, conducting additive and binder) has to buffer the huge volume change occurring upon cycling. This work highlights the differences observed on Sn-CMC electrode performance by using different Sn particle sizes (micro- and nanoparticles) and evaluating the role of the conductive additive in the electrode. Carbon fibers (VGCF) demonstrate a good ability to surround micrometer particles but not especially nanometer particles leading to an improvement in the performance of microparticles but not of nanoparticles. For a high loading electrode suitable for full cell applications (>3.5 mg/cm(2) of active material), nanometer particles show limited performance for long-term cycling.

In this study, the multifunction of sodium polyacrylate (PAAS) utilized to develop a hierarchical porous silicon-carbon anode (Si/SiOx@C) through a simple and efficient method. The hierarchical porous structure successively consists of nano-silicon cores, SiOx encapsulating layers, surrounding space, and phenolic resin-derived carbon shells with carbon chains connecting the SiOx layers and carbon shells in the space. The SiOx nanolayers promote Li⁺ transport, while excess PAAS, removed by washing, generates space for volume expansion, improving cycling performance. Residual carbon chains of PAAS and carbon shells form a conducting carbon network, enhancing electron transport and rate performance. As an anode for LIBs, the composite delivers a high reversible capacity of 685.3 mAh g⁻¹ after 1000 cycles at 1 C with a capacity retention rate of 54.7%. Full cells with the Si/SiOx@C anode and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode exhibit an excellent capacity retention rate of 96.8% after 200 cycles at 1 C. This work provides a novel approach for the rational design and engineering of advanced LIBs.",

Herein, a carbon-decorated MoS2/CoS heterostructure on carbon cloth (MoS2/CoS@CC) as a free-standing anode for SIBs was synthesized via a facile growth-carbonization strategy. In the composite, the generated built-in electric field at MoS2 and CoS heterointerfaces is beneficial for elevating the electron conductivity, thus expediting the Na-ion transport rate. Moreover, different redox potentials between MoS2 and CoS can effectively mitigate the mechanical strain induced by repeated Na+ de-/intercalation, thus ensuring the structural integrity. In addition, the carbon skeleton derived from the carbonization of glucose can enhance the conductivity of the electrode and maintain the structural integrity. Consequently, the resulting MoS2/CoS@CC electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 605 mA h g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 after 100 cycles, and prominent rate performance (366 mA h g-1 at 8.0 A g-1). Theoretical calculations also confirm that the establishment of a MoS2/CoS heterojunction can powerfully promote the electron conductivity, thereby enhancing the Na-ion diffusion kinetics.",

It has been demonstrated that for HC anodes improved electrochemical performance, e.g., increase in coulombic efficiency (CE) and improved rate performance have been achieved in ether‐based electrolytes.

        "abstract": "We report an effective approach of utilizing multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as an active anode material in sodium ion batteries by expanding the interlayer distance in a few outer layers of multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The performance enhancement was investigated using a density functional tight binding (DFTB) molecular dynamics simulation. It is found that a sodium atom forms a stable bonding with the partially expanded MWCNT (PECNT) with the binding energy of -1.50 eV based on the density functional theory calculation with van der Waals correction, where a sodium atom is caged between the two carbon hexagons in the two consecutive MWCNTs. Wave function and charge density analyses show that this binding is physisorption in nature. This larger exothermic nature of binding energy favors the stable bonding between the PECNT and a sodium atom, and thereby, it helps to enhance the electrochemical performance. In the experimental works, partial opening of the MWCNT with the expanded interlayer has been designed by the well-known Hummer's method. It has been found that the introduction of functional groups causes a partial opening of the outer few layers of a MWCNT, with the inner core remaining undisturbed. The enhanced performance is due to an expanded interlayer of carbon nanotubes, which provide sufficient active sites for the sodium ions to adsorb as well as to intercalate into the carbon structure. The PECNT shows a high specific capacity of 510 mAh g-1 at a current density of 20 mA g-1, which is about 2.3 times the specific capacity obtained for a pristine MWCNT at the same current density. This specific capacity is higher when compared to other carbon-based materials. The PECNT also shows a satisfactory cyclic stability at a current density of 200 mA g-1 for 100 cycles. Based on our experimental and theoretical results, an alternative perspective for the storage of sodium ions in MWCNTs is proposed.",

        "abstract": "Reduced graphene oxides loaded with tin-antimony alloy (RGO-SnSb) nanocomposites were synthesized through a hydrothermal reaction and the subsequent thermal reduction treatments. Transmission electron microscope images confirm that SnSb nanoparticles with an average size of about 20-30 nm are uniformly dispersed on the RGO surfaces. When they were used as anodes for rechargeable sodium (Na)-ion batteries, these as-synthesized RGO-SnSb nanocomposite anodes delivered a high initial reversible capacity of 407 mAh g(-1), stable cyclic retention for more than 80 cycles and excellent cycle stability at ultra high charge/discharge rates up to 30C. The significantly improved performance of the synthesized RGO-SnSb nanocomposites as Na-ion battery anodes can be attributed to the synergetic effects of RGO-based flexible framework and the nanoscale dimension of the SnSb alloy particles (<30 nm). Nanosized intermetallic SnSb compounds can exhibit improved structural stability and conductivity during charge and discharge reactions compared to the corresponding individuals (Sn and Sb particles). In the meantime, RGO sheets can tightly anchor SnSb alloy particles on the surfaces, which can not only effectively suppress the agglomeration of SnSb particles but also maintain excellent electronic conduction. Furthermore, the mechanical flexibility of the RGO phase can accommodate the volume expansion and contraction of SnSb particles during the prolonged cycling, therefore, improve the electrode integrity mechanically and electronically. All of these contribute to the electrochemical performance improvements of the RGO-SnSb nanocomposite-based electrodes in rechargeable Na-ion batteries.",

However, the poor rate performance and cyclability of these conversion anodes remain a significant challenge for Na-ion battery applications because most of the conversion anodes suffer from sluggish kinetics and irreversible structural change during cycles. In this paper, we report an Fe2O3 single crystallites/reduced graphene oxide composite (Fe2O3/rGO), where the Fe2O3 single crystallites with a particle size of ∼300 nm were uniformly anchored on the rGO nanosheets, which provide a highly conductive framework to facilitate electron transport and a flexible matrix to buffer the volume change of the material during cycling. This Fe2O3/rGO composite anode shows a very high reversible capacity of 610 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1, a high Coulombic efficiency of 71% at the first cycle, and a strong cyclability with 82% capacity retention after 100 cycles, suggesting a potential feasibility for sodium-ion batteries. More significantly, the present work clearly illustrates that an electrochemical conversion anode can be made with high capacity utilization, strong rate capability, and stable cyclability through appropriately tailoring the lattice structure, particle size, and electronic conduction channels for a simple transition-metal oxide, thus offering abundant selections for development of low-cost and high-performance Na-storage electrodes.",

Na2Ti3O7 (NTO) as an eco-friendly, low-cost anode material shows a very low working potential of 0.3 V vs. Na+/Na but suffers from poor cycling stability, which properties can be significantly influenced by materials synthesis and treatment. Thus, in this work, the influence of the calcination time on the electrochemical performance and the reaction mechanism during cycling were investigated. NTO heat-treated for 48 h at 800 °C (NTO-48h) demonstrated enhanced cycling performance in comparison to NTO heat-treated for only 8 h (NTO-8h). The pristine material was thoroughly characterized by X-ray diffraction, laser granulometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and specific surface area measurements. The reaction mechanisms induced by sodiation/desodiation and cycling were investigated by operando XRD. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to evidence the evolution of the solid electrolyte interface layer (SEI) and modification of charge transfer resistances as well as the influence of cycling on capacity decay. The evolution of the crystallographic structure of NTO-48h revealed a more ordered structure and lower surface contamination compared to NTO-8h. Moreover, the residual Na4Ti3O7 phase detected after the sodium extraction step in NTO-8h seems correlated to the lower electrochemical performance of NTO-8h compared to NTO-48h.",

Benefiting from the homogeneous ion flux and exceptional sodiophilic features, the Nb2CTx nanoflakes embedded within the 3D scaffold regulate the uniform deposition of metallic Na with a stable SEI layer, achieving an ultralong cycle lifespan of 3000 h at 1 mA cm−2 with 1 mAh cm−2 and an impressive Coulombic efficiency of 99.68% over extended lifespan of 7064 h. Further, the in‐depth characterization analysis proves that the formed stable SEI layer consists of an inorganic NaF accumulated in the inner layer and loosely‐bound organic species in the outer layer. Remarkably, when integrated into a Na metal full cell, the reversible capacity reaches 90.22 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at 100 mA g−1.

        "abstract": "A composite made from graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and tin oxide (SnO2) nanoparticles (NPs) is synthesized and used as the anode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). The conductive GNRs, prepared using sodium/potassium unzipping of multiwall carbon nanotubes, can boost the lithium storage performance of SnO2 NPs. The composite, as an anode material for LIBs, exhibits reversible capacities of over 1520 and 1130 mAh/g for the first discharge and charge, respectively, which is more than the theoretical capacity of SnO2. The reversible capacity retains ~825 mAh/g at a current density of 100 mA/g with a Coulombic efficiency of 98% after 50 cycles. Further, the composite shows good power performance with a reversible capacity of ~580 mAh/g at the current density of 2 A/g. The high capacity, good power performance and retention can be attributed to uniformly distributed SnO2 NPs along the high-aspect-ratio GNRs. The GNRs act as conductive additives that buffer the volume changes of SnO2 during cycling. This work provides a starting point for exploring the composites made from GNRs and other transition metal oxides for lithium storage applications.",

        "abstract": "Phase engineering of the electrode materials in terms of designing heterostructures, introducing heteroatom and defects, improves great prospects in accelerating the charge storage kinetics during the repeated Li + /Na + insertion/deintercalation. Herein, a new design of Li/Na-ion battery anodes through phase regulating is reported consisting of F doped SnO 2 -SnS 2 heterostructures nanocrystals with oxygen/sulfur vacancies (V O /V S ) anchored on 2D sulfur/nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide matrix (F-SnO 2-x -SnS 2-x @N/S-RGO). Consequently, F-SnO 2-x -SnS 2-x @N/S-RGO anode demonstrates superb high reversible capacity and long-term cycling stability. Moreover, it exhibits excellent great rate capability with 589 mAh g -1 for Li + and 296 mAh g -1 at 5 A g -1 for Na + . The enhanced Li/Na storage properties of the nanocomposites are not only attributed to the increase in conductivity caused by V O /V S and F doping (confirmed by DFT calculations) to accelerate their charge-transfer kinetics but also the increased interaction between F-SnO 2-x -SnS 2-x and Li/Na through heterostructure. Meanwhile, the hierarchical F-SnO 2-x -SnS 2-x @N/S-RGO network structure enables fast infiltration of electrolyte and improves electron/ion transportation in the electrode, and the corrosion resistance of F doping contributes to prolonged cycle stability.",

        "abstract": "Si has the highest theoretical capacity (4200 mA h g-1) among conventional anode materials, such as graphite (372 mA h g-1), but its large volume expansion leads to deterioration of the battery performance. To overcome this problem (issue), we investigated the use of polysaccharide-based 3D cross-linked network binders for Si anodes, in which the polysaccharide formed an effective 3D cross-linked network around Si particles via cross-linking of polysaccharide with citric acid (CA). Sodium alginate (SA), a natural polysaccharide extracted from brown algae, is a suitable binder material for Si anodes because its abundant hydroxyl (-OH) and carboxyl (-COOH) groups form hydrogen and covalent bonds with the -OH groups present on the Si surface. We found that CA-cross-linked (CA-SA) could effectively prevent the volume expansion of Si anodes through the formation of 3D cross-linked network structures. In addition, the CA-SA binders provide enhanced adhesion strength, enabling the fabrication of more robust electrodes than those prepared using binders with linear structures (\"linear binders\"). In particular, the fabricated Si-based electrode (high mass loading of 1.5 mg cm-2) with CA-SA binder exhibited outstanding areal capacity (∼2.7 mA h cm-2) and excellent cycle retention (∼100% after 100 cycles).",

        "abstract": "Sodium-based dual-ion batteries (SDIBs) have become a new type of energy storage device with great application value because of their high operating voltage, high energy density, and low cost. However, transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) anodes show unsatisfactory Na+ electrochemical performance owing to the low intrinsic conductivity and inferior ion transport kinetics. Here, an elaborate design is developed to prepare a composite of WSSe nanosheets supported on a 3D cross-networked porous carbon skeleton (WSSe@CPCS), which possesses en-rich anion vacancies and WSSe with expanded inter-layer spacing, as well as an interconnected porous structure. As a result, the WSSe@CPCS anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) exhibits preeminent reversible capacities, excellent cycle stability, and superior rate capability. The systematic electrochemical kinetic analysis and density functional theory results further show that the effect of anion vacancies and CPCS synergistically enhances the conductivity and reduces charge transfer resistance, thus making a great contribution to fast reaction kinetics. Finally, the implementations of the WSSe@CPCS anode in progressive SIB and DIB full-cell configurations exhibit satisfactory performance, which reveals their widely practical application. This research will provide an exciting approach to designing advanced defect-structured tungsten-based TMD materials for SIBs, DIBs, and even a broad range of energy storage.",

Unfortunately, commercialization has been hampered by several problems with dendrite growth and side reactions. Herein, we select sodium tartrate (TA-Na) as a dual-functional electrolyte additive to enhance the reversibility of AZIBs. The tartrate anions are preferentially adsorbed on the Zn surface, and then the highly nucleophilic carboxylate will coordinate with Zn2+ to promote the desolvation of [Zn(H2O)6]2+, leading to uniform Zn deposition on the beneficial (002) plane and inhibiting side reactions and dendrite growth. Consequently, the Zn|Zn cells show a long-term cycling stability of over 1500 cycles at 0.5 mA cm-2. Moreover, the Ta-Na additive improves the performance of Zn||MnO2 full cells, evidenced by a cycling life of 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1 under practical conditions with a limited Zn anode (negative/positive capacity ratio of 10/1) and controlled electrolyte (electrolyte/capacity ratio of 20 μL mAh-1).",

However, searching for suitable anode materials with high-rate and stable cycling performance is still needed to promote their practical application. Herein, three-dimensional Na2Ti3O7 nanowire arrays with enriched surface vacancies endowed by phosphorus doping are reported. When evaluated as anodes for sodium-ion batteries, the electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 290 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C, good rate capability (50 mAh g-1 at 20 C), and stable cycling capability (98% capacity retention over 3100 cycles at 20 C). The superior electrochemical performance is attributed to the synergistic effects of the unique nanowire arrays and phosphorus doping. The rational structures can provide convenient channels to facilitate ions/electrons transport and improve the capacitive contributions. Moreover, the phosphorus-doping-induced surface vacancies not only provide more active sites but also improve the intrinsic electrical conductivity of Na2Ti3O7, which will enable the electrode materials with excellent sodium storage performance. This work may provide an effective strategy for the synthesis of other anode materials with fast electrochemical reaction kinetics and good sodium storage performance.",

        "abstract": "Room-temperature Na ion batteries (NIBs) have attracted great attention because of the widely available, abundant sodium resources and potentially low cost. Currently, the challenge of the NIB development is due primarily to the lack of a high-performance anode, while the Na metal anode holds great promise considering its highest specific capacity of 1165 mA h/g and lowest anodic potential. However, an uneven deposit, relatively infinite volume change, and dendritic growth upon plating/stripping cycles cause a low Coulombic efficiency, poor cycling performance, and severe safety concerns. Here, a stable Na carbonized wood (Na-wood) composite anode was fabricated via a rapid melt infusion (about 5 s) into channels of carbonized wood by capillary action. The channels function as a high-surface-area, conductive, mechanically stable skeleton, which lowers the effective current density, ensures a uniform Na nucleation, and restricts the volume change over cycles. As a result, the Na-wood composite anode exhibited flat plating/stripping profiles with smaller overpotentials and stable cycling performance over 500 h at 1.0 mA/cm2 in a common carbonate electrolyte system. In sharp comparison, the planar Na metal electrode showed a much shorter cycle life of 100 h under the same test conditions.",

The unhindered ion transmission greatly benefits from honeycomb‐structured fibers with huge electrolyte uptake (376.7%) and the polymer's inherent transport ability. Additionally, polar polymer chains consisting of polyethersulfone and polyvinylidene customize the highly aggregated solvation structure of electrolytes via substantial solvent immobilization, facilitating ion‐conductivity‐enhanced inorganic‐rich solid‐electrolyte interphase with remarkable interface endurance. With the reliable mechanical strength of the separator, the assembled sodium‐ion full cell delivers significantly improved energy density and high safety, enabling stable operation under cutting and rolling.

        "abstract": "Developing hard carbon with a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and very good cycling stability is of great importance for practical sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Defects and oxygen-containing groups grown along either the carbon edges or the layers, however, are inevitable in hard carbon and can cause a tremendous density of irreversible Na+ sites, decreasing the efficiency and therefore causing failure of the battery. Thus, eliminating these unexpected defect structures is significant for enhancing the battery performance. Herein, we develop a strategy of applying a soft-carbon coating onto free-standing hard-carbon electrodes, which greatly hinders the formation of defects and oxygen-containing groups on hard carbon. The electrochemical results show that the soft-carbon-coated, free-standing hard-carbon electrodes can achieve an ultrahigh ICE of 94.1% and long cycling performance (99% capacity retention after 100 cycles at a current density of 20 mA g-1), demonstrating their great potential in practical sodium storage systems. The sodium storage mechanism was also investigated by operando Raman spectroscopy. Our sodium storage mechanism extends the \"adsorption-intercalation-pore filling-deposition\" model. We propose that the pore filling in the plateau area might be divided into two parts: (1) sodium could fill in the pores near the inner wall of the carbon layer; (2) when the sodium in the inner wall pores is close to saturation, the sodium could be further deposited onto the existing sodium.",

        "abstract": "The anodic dissolution behavior of aluminum was studied in various sodium-based electrolyte solutions using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The aim was to investigate how different electrolyte and solvent compositions affect the dissolution process. The electrolyte solutions tested included 0.284 m NaBOB in TEP, 1.00 m NaPF6 in TEP, 1.00 m NaPF6 in EC:DEC, 1.00 m NaPF6 in diglyme, 1.00 m NaFSI in PC, and 1.00 m NaFSI in TEP. SEM imaging was also performed to analyze the morphological changes of the aluminum surface during the dissolution process.\n To emphasize any dissolution process, relatively large volumes (3-5 ml) of electrolyte solution was used in polytetrafluoroethylene beaker cells. A three-electrode configuration was used to obtain the desired accuracy in the electrochemical tests.\n Severe anodic aluminum dissolution was not observed below 5.3 V vs. Na+/Na in electrolyte solutions containing NaBOB in TEP, NaPF6 in TEP, NaPF6 in EC:DEC, or NaPF6 in diglyme. Anodic dissolution was, however, detected in electrolyte solutions containing NaFSI in PC and NaFSI in TEP, affirming that caution should be exercised when using FSI-anions with aluminum current collectors.1,2 Yet, the choice of solvent used with NaFSI appeared to influenced the anodic dissolution behavior of aluminum. Here, TEP seemed to suppress the initial dissolution, compared to PC.\n In summary, this study provides insights into the anodic dissolution behavior of aluminum in sodium-ion batteries, and highlights the significance of selecting appropriate solution compositions to mitigate potential anodic dissolution issues. The findings contribute to the understanding of the electrochemical behavior of aluminum in the context of sodium-ion batteries, and provides a foundation for further studies.\n The authors acknowledge The Swedish Energy Agency via project no. 50177-1, VINNOVA via projects no. 2022-01465 and 2019-00064 (Batteries Sweden), and H2020 research and innovation programme under Grant agreements No 958174 and 963542 for financial support.\n 1.

        "abstract": "Inorganic electrolytes for solid state batteries with Li metallic anodes must combine properties such as high ionic conductivity, chemical stability, and resistance to failure due to propagation of Li dendrites. Abundance of experimental evidence suggests that cracking of the solid electrolytes due to pressure exerted by lithium plating into the material defects is the primary source of failure [1]. This is due to inherent brittleness of the ceramic ionic conductors, i.e. their inability to reduce stress by means other than fracture. Unlike ceramics, plastic deformation in glass can be achieved via shear and (or) by densification. Both mechanisms can be operational in glasses with reduced content of glass formers relative to the content of glass modifiers – i.e. inverted glasses. Using the example of lithium phosphorous oxynitride, Lipon, we demonstrate how these two mechanisms are capable of accommodating applied stress while avoiding creation of new surfaces by cracking. We investigate the resistance to fracture in Lipon-like glasses and the underlying connection to their composition via instrumented nano-indentation, Raman spectroscopy, and numerical simulations. We observe enhancement of isochoric shear with increase of Li content, similarly to the reports of increased plasticity in sodium aluminoborate glases with high alkali content [2]. Nano-indentation demonstrates that Lipon is extremely resistant to fracture, compared to other inorganic solid electrolytes [3].\n [1] Porz, T. Swamy, B.W. Sheldon, D. Rettenwander, T. Fromling, H.L.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been extensively studied owing to the abundance and low-price of Na resources. However, the infeasibility of graphite and silicon electrodes in sodium-ion storage makes it urgent to develop high-performance anode materials. Herein, α-MnSe nanorods derived from δ-MnO2 (δ-α-MnSe) are constructed as anodes for SIBs. It is verified that α-MnSe will be transferred into β-MnSe after the initial Na-ion insertion/extraction, and δ-α-MnSe undergoes typical conversion mechanism using a Mn-ion for charge compensation in the subsequent charge-discharge process. First-principles calculations support that Na-ion migration in defect-free α-MnSe can drive the lattice distortion to phase transition (alpha → beta) in thermodynamics and dynamics. The formed β-MnSe with robust lattice structure and small Na-ion diffusion barrier boosts great structure stability and electrochemical kinetics. Hence, the δ-α-MnSe electrode contributes excellent rate capability and superior cyclic stability with long lifespan over 1000 cycles and low decay rate of 0.0267% per cycle. Na-ion full batteries with a high energy density of 281.2 Wh·kg-1 and outstanding cyclability demonstrate the applicability of δ-α-MnSe anode.",

However, the practical applications of OSIBs are generally limited by the inherent disadvantages of organic electrodes, such as their low conductivity, poor stability, and high solubility in electrolytes. Herein, we presented [5, 10, 15, 20-tetrathienylporphinato] M (II) (MTTP, M=2H, Ni) as new electrode materials in sodium-organic batteries. The incorporation of thiophene functionalized groups and nickel (Ⅱ) ion in the molecular design of porphyrins enabled stable and excellent electrochemical performance in sodium storage systems. Benefiting from multiple charge storage sites and bipolar characteristics, the NiTTP anode has a reversible capacity of 434 mAh g−1 at a current density of 25 mA g−1. An excellent long-term cycling stability and high average voltage were obtained when NiTTP was used as a cathode. In a symmetrical battery, where NiTTP was used as both cathode and anode materials, a high average voltage of 2.3 V and a practical energy density of 93 Wh kg−1 was achieved. These results suggest that the thiophene-based porphyrin derivatives would be promising electrode materials for long-term organic sodium ion batteries for green and stable energy storage.",

        "abstract": "There are only a handful of reports on indium sulfide (In2S3) in the electrochemical energy storage field without a clear electrochemical reaction mechanism. In this work, a simple electrospinning method has been used to synthesize In2S3/C nanofibers for the first time. In lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the In2S3/C nanofiber electrode can not only deliver a high initial reversible specific capacity of 696.4 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1, but also shows ultra-long cycle life with a capacity retention of 80.5% after 600 cycles at 1000 mA g-1. In sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), the In2S3/C nanofibers electrode can exhibit a high initial reversible specific capacity (393.7 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1) and excellent cycling performance with a high capacity retention of 97.3% after 300 cycles at 1000 mA g-1. The excellent electrochemical properties mainly benefited from In2S3 being encapsulated by a carbon matrix, which buffers the volume expansion and significantly improves the conductivity of the composite. Furthermore, the structural evolution of In2S3 during the first lithiation/delithiation and sodiation/desodiation processes has been illustrated by ex situ XRD. The results confirm that the reaction mechanism of In2S3 in both LIBs and SIBs can be summarized as conversion reactions and alloying reactions, which provide theoretical support for the development of In2S3 in the field of electrochemistry.",

However, the sodium polysulfide shuttle effect and dendritic growth pose significant challenges to their practical applications. In this study, we apply diverse disciplinary backgrounds to introduce a novel method to stimulate polarized BaTiO3 (BTO) nanoparticles on the separator. This approach generates more charges due to the piezoelectric effect under stronger driving forces produced by applying a controllable acoustic field at the outer edge of the cell. The acoustically stimulated BTO attracts more polysulfides, thus reducing the shuttling effect from the cathode to the anode and ultimately enhancing the battery performance. Meanwhile, the acoustic waves create additional streaming flows, improving the uniformity of the sodium ion dispersion, enhancing the sodium ion transport and reducing the possibility of sodium dendrite development. We believe that this work offers a new strategy for the development of high-performance Na–S batteries.",

        "abstract": "Owing to several advantages of metallic sodium (Na), such as a relatively high theoretical capacity, low redox potential, wide availability, and low cost, Na metal batteries are being extensively studied, which are expected to play a major role in the fields of electric vehicles and grid-scale energy storage. Although considerable efforts have been devoted to utilizing MXene-based materials for suppressing Na dendrites, achieving a stable cycling of Na metal anodes remains extremely challenging due to, for example, the low Coulombic efficiency (CE) caused by the severe side reactions. Herein, a g-C3N4 layer was attached in situ on the Ti3C2 MXene surface, inducing a surface state reconstruction and thus forming a stable hetero-interphase with excellent sodiophilicity between the MXene and g-C3N4 to inhibit side reactions and guide uniform Na ion flux. The 3D construction can not only lower the local current density to facilitate uniform Na plating/stripping but also mitigate volume change to stabilize the electrolyte/electrode interphase. Thus, the 3D Ti3C2 MXene@g-C3N4 nanocomposite enables much enhanced average CEs (99.9% at 1 mA h cm-2, 0.5 mA cm-2) in asymmetric half cells, long-term stability (up to 700 h) for symmetric cells, and stable cycling (up to 800 cycles at 2 C), together with outstanding rate capability (up to 20 C), of full cells.

HNFBs are composed of a molten Na-Cs alloy anode, flowing aqueous catholyte, and a Na-β″-Al2O3 solid electrolyte as the separator. The surface functionalization of graphite felt electrodes for the flowing aqueous catholyte has been studied for its effectiveness in enhancing V(2+)/V(3+), V(3+)/V(4+), and V(4+)/V(5+) redox couples. The V(4+)/V(5+) redox reaction has been further investigated at different cell operation temperatures for its cyclic stability and how the properties of the solid electrolyte membrane play a role in cycling. These fundamental understandings provide guidelines for improving the cyclic performance and stability of HNFBs with aqueous catholytes. We show that the HNFB with aqueous V-ion catholyte can reach high storage capacity (∼70% of the theoretical capacity) with good Coulombic efficiency (90% ± 1% in 2-30 cycles) and cyclic performance (>99% capacity retention for 30 cycles). It demonstrates, for the first time, the potential of high capacity HNFBs with aqueous catholytes, good capacity retention and long cycling life.

Although much research exists on the effect of pyrolysis temperature on the microstructure of hard carbon materials, there are few reports that focus on the development of pore structure during the pyrolysis process. In this study, corncob is used as the raw material to synthesize hard carbon at a pyrolysis temperature of 1000~1600 °C, and their interrelationationship between pyrolysis temperature, microstructure and sodium storage properties are systematically studied. With the pyrolysis temperature increasing from 1000 °C to 1400 °C, the number of graphite microcrystal layers increases, the long-range order degree rises, and the pore structure shows a larger size and wide distribution. The specific capacity, the initial coulomb efficiency, and the rate performance of hard carbon materials improve simultaneously. However, as the pyrolysis temperature rises further to 1600 °C, the graphite-like layer begins to curl, and the number of graphite microcrystal layers reduces. In return, the electrochemical performance of the hard carbon material decreases. This model of pyrolysis temperatures–microstructure–sodium storage properties will provide a theoretical basis for the research and application of biomass hard carbon materials in SIBs.",

In this work, the design and synthesis of vertically grown MoS2 nanosheet arrays, decorated with graphite carbon and Fe2 O3 nanoparticles, on flexible carbon fiber cloth (denoted as Fe2 O3 @C@MoS2 /CFC) is reported. When evaluated as an anode for lithium-ion batteries, the Fe2 O3 @C@MoS2 /CFC electrode manifests an outstanding electrochemical performance with a high discharge capacity of 1541.2 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and a good capacity retention of 80.1% at 1.0 A g-1 after 500 cycles. As for sodium-ion batteries, it retains a high reversible capacity of 889.4 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 over 200 cycles. The superior electrochemical performance mainly results from the unique 3D ordered Fe2 O3 @C@MoS2 array-type nanostructures and the synergistic effect between the C@MoS2 nanosheet arrays and Fe2 O3 nanoparticles. The Fe2 O3 nanoparticles act as spacers to steady the structure, and the graphite carbon could be incorporated into MoS2 nanosheets to improve the conductivity of the whole electrode and strengthen the integration of MoS2 nanosheets and CFC by the adhesive role, together ensuring high conductivity and mechanical stability.",

Phosphorus (P) is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries, with a theoretical capacity of 2596 mAh/g. The red phosphorus (RP) form has worse electronic conductivity and lower initial Coulombic efficiency than black phosphorus (BP), but high material cost and limited production capacity have slowed the development of BP anodes. To address these challenges, we have developed a simple and scalable method to synthesize layered BP/graphene composite (BP/rGO) by pressurization at room temperature. A carbon-black-free and binder-free BP/rGO anode prepared with this method achieved specific charge capacities of 1460.1, 1401.2, 1377.6, 1339.7, 1277.8, 1123.78, and 720.8 mAh/g in a rate capability test at charge and discharge current densities of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, and 40 A/g, respectively. In a cycling performance test, after 500 deep cycles, the capacity of BP/rGO anodes stabilized at 1250 and 640 mAh/g at 1 and 40 A/g, respectively, which marks a significant performance improvement for sodium-ion battery anodes.",

However, they usually exhibit inferior thermodynamic stability and sluggish Na+ kinetics due to the unwanted phase transitions and large Na+-ionic radius. In this work, considering the beneficial synergistic effects of layered P2/P3 and Fd3[combining macron]m spinel phases, a stable layered/spinel intergrowth nanocomposite Na0.5[Ni0.2Co0.15Mn0.65]O2 is rationally designed and successfully prepared via a co-precipitation route and a subsequent solid-state reaction, and the triphase synergy in this layered/spinel nanocomposite is demonstrated. In Na/Na0.5[Ni0.2Co0.15Mn0.65]O2 half-cells, it delivers a high specific capacity of ∼180 mA h g-1 and a good cycling stability, with a capacity retention of 87.6% after 100 cycles, at a rate of 0.1C between 1.5 and 4.0 V (vs. Na/Na+). The large reversible capacity of 105 mA h g-1 is also achieved even at a high rate of 10C, indicating high-rate capability. Besides, the full-cells using this nanocomposite as the cathode and hard carbon as the anode exhibit long-term cycle-life and high-power properties, indicating the expected merits of layered/spinel mixed phases.

        "abstract": "Electrochemical ion storage behaviors of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, as a representative transition metal oxide for an environmentally benign and low-cost anode for a sodium-ion battery, are thoroughly investigated through a combination of electrochemical analysis and diagnostics of Fe3O4 electrode cells, X-ray-based and spectroscopic analysis of material structure evolution as functions of depth of discharge (DoD) and state of charge (SoC), and first principle modeling. The gravimetric capacity is found to be 50 mA h/g for bulk Fe3O4 (50 nm average crystallite size) and 100 mA h/g─about a tenth of the theoretical prediction for complete conversion─for Fe3O4 nanoparticles (8.7 nm average particle size), respectively. A fundamental and mechanistic study of material evolution as functions of DoD and SoC shows that Fe3O4 does not allow electrochemical incorporation of Na+ ions into the empty cation positions of the inverse spinel structure, leading to our assertion that electrochemical intercalation of Na+ ions to conversion of the Fe3O4 anode in sodium-ion batteries is nonviable. A density functional theory investigation points to the impracticality of the intercalation of Na+ ions into Fe3O4 and further validates our experimental findings. We propose several possible mechanisms corresponding to the observed low capacity, including formation of solid electrolyte interphases with unfavorable properties and adsorption of Na+ ions onto surfaces of nanoparticles and/or at heterointerfaces in Fe3O4 composite electrodes in a NaPF6-based electrolyte system.",

It is in situ formed by the reaction between sodium anode and fish‐skin structure separator, which exhibits a 3D porous polyvinylidene fluoride‐based framework embedded with thin and robust vermiculite sheets. The robust interphase cannot only suppress sodium dendrite growth but also enable high energy density with small interphase‐consumed Na ions in anode‐less batteries. Accordingly, the as‐assembled NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2//Na cell shows 83% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at a rate of 5 °C. Moreover, the proof‐of‐concept pouch cells deliver an energy density of 205 Wh kg−1 (based on the total mass of the battery), and high safety (not catching fire after punctured) under anode‐less condition (with a low negative/positive capacity ratio of ≈2.1).",

The superior performance can be ascribed to the unique core-shell structure.

The dual-carbon network not only provides more transport pathways for electrons but also relaxes the huge volume change of the electrode material during the charge/discharge process.

It delivers a high reversible capacity of 597.5 and 175 mAh/g at the current density of 0.1 and 5.0 A/g, respectively. Furthermore, at the current density of 0.5 A/g, the GeP5/AB/p-rGO composite shows the reversible capacity of 400 mAh/g after 50 cycles with a little capacity attenuation.

The nanocrystal‐on‐graphene structure and robust C─S &C─Se bonding rivets between CoS2‐xSex and SG greatly improve the structural stability of the CoS2‐xSex@SG. Electrochemical performance, kinetic analysis, and theoretical calculation reveal that Se substitution plays a double‐edged role in sodium storage: the increase of Se substitution content enhances the Na+ diffusion kinetics but decreases the Na‐storage capacity. When the Se substitution content is 0.4, the CoS1.6Se0.4@SG electrode demonstrates the best performance: high initial Coulombic efficiency (95.5%), ultrahigh rate capability (412.8 mAh g−1 at 30 A g−1), and ultra‐stable cycling performance (97.6% capacity retention after 1000 cycles). In situ/ex situ measurements further unveil that the conversion reaction between Co0 and Na2S/Na2Se generates the micro‐scaled CoSe2–CoS2 heterostructure, synergistically improving the Na‐storage active sites and reaction kinetics.

        "abstract": "Achieving cost-effective and sustainable solutions for large-scale energy storage is critical for advancing the global clean energy transition. The intermittent nature of green energy underscores the inadequacy of current large scale energy storage technologies like pumped hydroelectricity which is susceptible to geographic and water resource constraints, making batteries a prime candidate for this role. Although lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy and power density are a viable solution, the high cost and uneven distribution of lithium reserves limits the widespread application of LIBs for grid energy storage. Considering these developments and the challenges posed by limited lithium reserves, sustainable and low-cost sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) emerge as a promising alternative.\n Among the various battery electrode materials, manganese dioxide (MnO2) stands out as a promising choice for large-scale energy storage applications due to its earth abundance, cost-effectiveness and non-toxic nature. Although MnO2 is known as a pseudocapacitive material with superior cycling stability in aqueous electrolytes, its dissolution in non-aqueous electrolytes has restricted its widespread use in long lifetime batteries. In this study, we demonstrate that an ether-based electrolyte solution (1M NaClO4 in diglyme) is able to achieve stable cycling of electrodeposited ε-MnO2 as a cathode for SIBs, reaching a over 75% capacity retention over 1000 cycles. This response surpasses conventional ester-based electrolytes (58% of 1M NaClO4 in EC/PC). A comparative cycling stability study, coupled with electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance characterization, validates the efficacy of the ether-based electrolyte in mitigating MnO2 dissolution. Furthermore, the integration of 3D printed graphene aerogel (3D GA) as a scaffold for electrodeposited MnO2 leads to enhanced electrochemical performance of the MnO2 electrode (3D MnO2/GA), resulting in a high areal capacity of 4.4 mAh cm-2 at a current density of 10 mA cm-2. The 3D MnO2/GA electrode possesses scalable electrochemical performance with mass loadings from 20 mg cm-2 to 80 mg cm-2. Using this electrode, a high mass loaded sodium-ion battery (SIB) device was fabricated by using utilizing 58 mg cm-2 3D MnO2/GA as the cathode and 16 mg cm-2 dip-coated TiO2@Cu foam as the anode.

        "abstract": "Bismuth (Bi) has attracted attention as a promising anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to its suitable potential and high theoretical capacity. However, the large volumetric changes during cycling leads to severe degradation of electrochemical performance and limits its practical application. Herein, Bi nanoflowers are encapsulated in N-doped carbon frameworks to construct a novel Bi@NC composite via a facile solvothermal method and carbonization strategy. The well-designed composite structure endows the Bi@NC with uniformly dispersed Bi nanoflowers to alleviate the attenuation while the N-doped carbon frameworks improve the conductivity and ion transport of the whole electrode. As for sodium-ion half-cell, the electrode exhibits a high specific capacity (384.8 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 ) and excellent rate performance (341.5 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 ), and the capacity retention rate still remains at 94.9% after 5000 cycles at 10 A g-1 . Furthermore, the assembled full-cell with Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 cathode and Bi@NC anode can deliver a high capacity of 251.5 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 , and its capacity attenuates only 0.009% in each cycle after 2000 times at 5.0 A g-1 .

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are potential low-cost alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) because of the much greater natural abundance of sodium salts. However, developing high-performance electrode materials for SIBs is a challenging task, especially due to the ∼50% larger ionic radius of the Na(+) ion compared to Li(+), leading to vastly different electrochemical behavior. Metal phosphides such as FeP, CoP, NiP(2), and CuP(2) remain unexplored as electrode materials for SIBs, despite their high theoretical charge storage capacities of 900-1300 mAh g(-1). Here we report on the synthesis of metal phosphide nanocrystals (NCs) and discuss their electrochemical properties as anode materials for SIBs, as well as for LIBs. We also compare the electrochemical characteristics of phosphides with their corresponding sulfides, using the environmentally benign iron compounds, FeP and FeS(2), as a case study. We show that despite the appealing initial charge storage capacities of up to 1200 mAh g(-1), enabled by effective nanosizing of the active electrode materials, further work toward optimization of the electrode/electrolyte pair is needed to improve the electrochemical performance upon cycling.",

        "title": "Efficient Sodium-Ion Storage Using MoS2@rGO Nanocomposite Anode: Exploring Na-Ion Diffusion in Metallic Phase",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are gaining attention as a better and more economical option than lithium-ion batteries, owing to the abundance and low cost of sodium in comparison to lithium. The anode component of rechargeable batteries plays a vital role in obtaining superior energy and power density. Consequently, the investigation of novel materials for SIBs with enhanced performance is imperative. Transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs) are found to be promising contenders for this purpose, particularly MoS2 due to their two-dimensional open framework, structural tunability, and high theoretical specific capacity as an anode material in sodium ion storage. In this regard, we conducted a facile strategy to synthesize MoS2 and aluminium-doped MoS2 incorporated into reduced graphene oxide (rGO) using the hydrothermal method. The structural and morphological properties of the samples have been explored through X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) measurements which revealed that the addition of aluminium increased the interlayer spacing of the (002) plane of MoS2 nanosheets and stabilized it in metallic 1T phase. The enhanced interlayer distance and improved conductivity of the electrode material displayed a significantly higher initial discharge specific capacity of around 750 mAhg−1 which is stabilized around 380 mAhg−1 at the current rate of 50 mAg−1 after 10 cycles as investigated through galvanostatic charge-discharge measurement. The long cycling test for 200 cycles revealed the capacity retention of ~65% and ~55 % at the current density of 100 and 300 mAg-1, respectively. The kinetic behavior of the Na-ion is studied employing cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and the diffusion coefficient of Na-ion in the bulk of the electrode was found to be in the range of 10-10 to 10-12 cm2s-1. Additionally, in-situ EIS analysis demonstrates the electrode's electrochemical kinetics at different charge-discharge states by showing variations in charge transfer resistance. Ex-situ XRD and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrated the coexistence of 1T and 2H phases, and field-emission SEM validated the stable morphology after cycling.\n \n Keywords: Sodium-ion batteries, Transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs), Anode material, MoS2\n \n \n References:\n \n \n N.Tapia-Ruiz et al., 2021 Roadmap for sodium-ion batteries, J.

        "abstract": "Metal sulfides are gaining prominence as conversion anode materials for lithium/sodium ion batteries due to their higher specific capacities but suffers from low stability and reversibility issues. In this work, the electrochemical properties of CuS anode material has been successfully enhanced by its composite formation using graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4). The CuS nanoparticles are distributed evenly in the exfoliated g-C3N4 matrix rendering higher electronic conductivity and space for volume alterations during the repeated discharge/charge cycles. The 0.8CuS:0.2g-C3N4 composite when used as an anode for lithium ion coin cell exhibits a reversible capacity of 478.4 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 2.0 A g−1 after a run of 1000 cycles which is better than that reported for CuS composites with any other carbon-based matrix. The performance is equally impressive when 0.8CuS:0.2g-C3N4 composite is used as an anode in a sodium ion coin cell and a reversible capacity of 408 mA h g−1 is obtained at a current rate of 2.0 A g−1 after a run of 800 cycles. A sodium ion full cell with NVP cathode and 0.8CuS:0.2g-C3N4 composite anode has been fabricated and cycled for 100 runs at a current rate of 0.1 A g−1. It can be inferred that the g-C3N4 matrix improves the ion transfer properties, alleviates the volume alteration happening in the anode during the discharge/charge process and also helps in preventing the leaching of polysulfides generated during the electrochemical process.",

        "abstract": "Alloying-type antimony (Sb) with high theoretical capacity is a promising anode candidate for both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Given the larger radius of Na+ (1.02 Å) than Li+ (0.76 Å), it was generally believed that the Sb anode would experience even worse capacity degradation in SIBs due to more substantial volumetric variations during cycling when compared to LIBs. However, the Sb anode in SIBs unexpectedly exhibited both better electrochemical and structural stability than in LIBs, and the mechanistic reasons that underlie this performance discrepancy remain undiscovered. Here, using substantial in situ transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman techniques complemented by theoretical simulations, we explicitly reveal that compared to lithiation/delithiation process, sodiation/desodiation process of Sb anode displays a previously unexplored two-stage alloying/dealloying mechanism with polycrystalline and amorphous phases as the intermediates featuring improved resilience to mechanical damage, contributing to superior cycling stability in SIBs. Additionally, the better mechanical properties and weaker atomic interaction of Na-Sb alloys than Li-Sb alloys favor enabling mitigated mechanical stress, accounting for enhanced structural stability as unveiled by theoretical simulations. Our finding delineates the mechanistic origins of enhanced cycling stability of Sb anode in SIBs with potential implications for other large-volume-change electrode materials.",

Sn nanoparticles encapsulated in carbon layers were distributed uniformly on the surfaces of the N-doped carbon nanotubes. The electrochemical performances of the composites were systematically investigated as anode materials in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The composite electrode could attain a good reversible capacity of 398.4 mAh g-1 when discharging at 100 mA g-1, with capacity retention of 67.3% and very high Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% over 150 cycles. This good cycling performance, when compared to only 17.5 mAh g-1 delivered by bare Sn particles prepared via the same method without the presence of N-doped carbon, could be mainly ascribed to the uniform distribution of the precursor SnO2 on the substrate of N-doped carbon tubes with three-dimensional structure, which provides more reaction sites to reduce the diffusion distance of Na+, further facilitating Na+-ion diffusion and relieves the huge volume expansion during charging/discharging. These outcomes imply that such a Sn/C composite would provide more options as an anode candidate for SIBs.",

The fundamental mechanism of the outstanding electrochemical performance of Bi@N‐C has been demonstrated through synchrotron in‐situ XRD, atomic force microscopy, ex‐situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculation.

This property is highly attractive to enhance the durability of rechargeable Li-ion batteries (LIBs) or Na-ion batteries (SIBs), where high-performing anode active materials (silicon, phosphorus, etc.) are strongly affected by volume expansion and phase changes upon ion insertion. Here, we applied a SH strategy, based on the dynamic quadruple hydrogen bonding, to nanosized black phosphorus (BP) anodes for Na-ion cells. The goal is to overcome drastic capacity decay and short lifetime, resulting from mechanical damages induced by the volumetric expansion/contraction upon sodiation/desodiation. Specifically, we developed novel ureidopyrimidinone (UPy)-telechelic systems and related blends with poly(ethylene oxide) as novel and green binders alternative to the more conventional ones, such as polyacrylic acid and carboxymethylcellulose, which are typically used in SIBs. BP anodes show impressively improved (more than 6 times) capacity retention when employing the new SH polymeric blend. In particular, the SH electrode still works at a current density higher than 3.5 A g–1, whereas the standard BP electrode exhibits very poor performances already at current densities lower than 0.5 A g–1.

This unique design enables the electrode to possess good structural stability, superior charge transfer kinetics, and low polarization. The intimate combination between the nanoparticles and the porous carbon matrix can effectively facilitate Na+/e- transfer and accommodate volume variation during cycling. The construction of the new structure presented in this work will extend the applications of the NaTi2(PO4)3 system. Furthermore, the formed hybrid structure has potential to be a universal model for various electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "It is demonstrated for the first time that surface passivation of 2D nanosheets of MoS2 by an ultrathin and uniform layer of HfO2 can significantly improve the cyclic performance of sodium ion batteries. After 50 charge/discharge cycles, bare MoS2 and HfO2 coated MoS2 electrodes deliver the specific capacity of 435 and 636 mAh g(-1) , respectively, at current density of 100 mA g(-1) . These results imply that batteries using HfO2 coated MoS2 anodes retain 91% of the initial capacity; in contrast, bare MoS2 anodes retain only 63%. Also, HfO2 coated MoS2 anodes show one of the highest reported capacity values for MoS2 . Cyclic voltammetry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results suggest that HfO2 does not take part in electrochemical reaction. The mechanism of capacity retention with HfO2 coating is explained by ex situ transmission electron microscope imaging and electrical impedance spectroscopy. It is illustrated that HfO2 acts as a passivation layer at the anode/electrolyte interface and prevents structural degradation during charge/discharge process. Moreover, the amorphous nature of HfO2 allows facile diffusion of Na ions. These results clearly show the potential of HfO2 coated MoS2 anodes, which performance is significantly higher than previous reports where bulk MoS2 or composites of MoS2 with carbonaceous materials are used.",

Furthermore, a full cell comprising a hard carbon anode and a biphasic cathode with 1 M NaPF6 electrolyte displayed excellent cyclic stabilities at a wider temperature range of -20 to 50 °C (with the energy density of 151.48 Wh kg-1) due to the enhanced structural stability, alleviated Jahn-Teller distortions, and rapid Na+ kinetics facilitating Na+ motion at various temperatures in sodium-ion batteries.

The excellent performances are contributed to the unique properties of RTMS with a large electrochemical window, solvated H2 O free and high mobility of Li+ , which exhibits excellent Li-ions insertion and extraction capacity of NaCoHCF.

Significantly, the anion insertion behavior of Fe2(dobpdc) enabled its use in the construction of a dual-ion battery prototype incorporating a sodium anode.

Here, we design microporous carbon nanospheres using a novel hybrid monomer that simultaneously involves an organic moiety and an inorganic moiety as the starting unit. The inorganic moiety forms a continuous network, which serves as a 3D scaffold and a nanometer-scale template, then supports the off-collapse of the carbon skeleton and creates a well-developed microporous structure. In addition, the graphite microcrystal structure can be tailored by adjusting the heating treatment temperatures. The electrochemical study demonstrates that the microporous carbon nanospheres show dominant capacitive sodium storage behavior, thus presenting an outstanding rate performance. Even if a very high current density of 10 A g-1 is applied, the hard carbon anode can deliver a large capacity of 127 mAh g-1 with a considerable plateau capacity of 53 mAh g-1, which has rarely been obtained in previous publications. Besides, the carbon anode has a good cycling stability, and the capacity reached 210 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles with a current density of 1 A g-1, showing no dramatic capacity loss.",

Here, a microflower-shaped SnO material is synthesized by means of an ultrafast ionic liquid-assisted microwave method. The as-prepared SnO anode active material exhibits excellent cycling performance, good Coulombic efficiency as well as a large capacity delivered at low potential, which is fundamental to maximize the energy output of SIBs. These overall merits were never reported before for pure SnO anodes (i.e., not in a composite with, for example, graphene). Additionally, by combining ex situ XRD and XPS, it is clearly demonstrated for the first time that the Sn-Na alloy, which is formed during the initial sodium sodiation, desodiates in two successive but fully separated steps. Totally different from the previous report, the pristine SnO phase is not regenerated upon desodiation up to 3 V vs Na/Na+.

The use of small-sized metal or metal compound nanoparticles, completely encapsulated by carbon materials, has attracted significant attention as an effective approach to enhancing sodium ion storage properties. These materials have the ability to mitigate structural collapse caused by volume expansion during the charging process, enable short ion transport length, and prevent polysulfide elution. In this study, a concept of highly porous carbon-coated carbon nanotube (CNT) porous microspheres, which serve as excellent reservoir materials is suggested and a porous microsphere is developed by encapsulating iron sulfide nanocrystals within the highly porous carbon-coated CNTs using a sulfidation process. Furthermore, various sulfidation processes to determine the optimal method for achieving complete encapsulation are investigated by comparing the morphologies of diverse iron sulfide-carbon composites. The fully encapsulated structure, combined with the porous carbon, provides ample space to accommodate the significant volume changes during cycling. As a result, the porous iron sulfide-carbon-CNT composite microspheres exhibited outstanding cycling stability (293 mA h g-1 over 600 cycles at 1 A g-1 ) and remarkable rate capability (100 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1 ).",

        "abstract": "Abstract Amorphous carbon holds great promise as anode material for sodium‐ion batteries due to its cost‐effectiveness and good performance. However, its sodium storage mechanism, particularly the insertion process and origin of plateau capacity, remains controversial. Here, an extended adsorption/insertion‐filling sodium storage mechanism is proposed using petroleum coke‐derived amorphous carbon as a multi‐microcrystalline model. Combining in situ X‐ray diffraction, in situ Raman, theoretical calculations, and neutron scattering, the effective storage form and location of sodium ions in amorphous carbon are revealed. The sodium adsorption at defect sites leads to a high‐potential sloping capacity. The sodium insertion process occurs in both the pseudo‐graphite phase (d 002 > 0.370 nm) and graphite‐like phase (0.345 ≤ d 002 < 0.370 nm) rather than the graphite phase, contributing to low‐potential sloping capacity. The sodium filling into accessible closed pores forms quasi‐metallic sodium clusters, contributing to plateau capacity. The threshold of the effective interlayer spacing for sodium insertion is extended to 0.345 nm, breaking the consensus of insertion interlayer threshold and enhancing understanding of closed pore filling.

        "abstract": "It is a major challenge to achieve a high‐performance anode for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) with high specific capacity, high rate capability, and cycling stability. Bismuth sulfide, which features a high theoretical specific capacity, tailorable morphology, and low cost, has been considered as a promising anode for SIBs. Nevertheless, due to a lack of direct atomistic observation, the detailed understanding of fundamental intercalation behavior and Bi2S3's (de)sodiation mechanisms remains unclear. Here, by employing in situ high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy, consecutive electron diffraction coupled with theoretical calculations, it is not only for the first time identified that Bi2S3 exhibits specific ionic transport pathways preferred to diffuse along the (110) direction instead of the (200) plane, but also tracks their real‐time phase transformations (de)sodiation involving multi‐step crystallographic tuning. The finite‐element analysis further disclosed multi‐reaction induced deformation and the relevant stress evolution originating from the combined effect of the mechanical and electrochemical interaction. These discoveries not only deepen the understanding of fundamental science about the microscopic reaction mechanism of metal chalcogenide anodes but also provide important implications for performance optimization.",

Herein, we proposed a facile synthesis of Fe7Se8 embedded in carbon nanofibers (denoted as Fe7Se8-NCFs). The Fe7Se8-NCFs with a 1D electron transfer network can facilitate Na+ transportation to ensure fast reaction kinetics. Moreover, Fe7Se8 encapsulated in carbon nanofibers, Fe7Se8-NCFs, can effectively adapt the volume variation to keep structural integrity during a continuous Na+ insertion and extraction process. As a result, Fe7Se8-NCFs present improved rate performance and remarkable cycling stability for sodium storage. The Fe7Se8-NCFs exhibit practical feasibility with a reasonable specific capacity of 109 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles and a favorable rate capability of 136 mA h g−1 at a high rate of 2 A g−1 when coupled with Na3V2(PO4)3 to assemble full sodium ion batteries.",

        "title": "Highly Reversible Sodium Metal Battery Anodes via Alloying Heterointerfaces.",
        "abstract": "As a promising pathway toward low-cost, long-duration energy storage, rechargeable sodium batteries are of increasing interest. Batteries that incorporate metallic sodium as anode promise a high theoretical specific capacity of 1166 mAh g-1 , and low reduction potential of -2.71 V. The high reactivity and poor electrochemical reversibility of sodium anodes render sodium metal anode (SMA) cells among the most challenging for practical implementation. Here, the failure mechanisms of Na anodes are investigated and the authors report that loss of morphological control is not the fundamental cause of failure. Rather, it is the inherently poor anchoring/root structure of electrodeposited Na to the electrode substrate that leads to poor reversibility and cell failure. Poorly anchored Na deposits are prone to break away from the current collector, producing orphaning and poor anode utilization. Thin metallic coatings in a range of chemistries are proposed and evaluated as SMA substrates. Based on thermodynamic and ion transport considerations, such substrates undergo reversible alloying reactions with Na and are hypothesized to promote good root growth-regardless of the morphology. Among the various options, Au stands out for its ability to support long Na anode lifetime and high reversibility (Coulombic Efficiency > 98%), for coating thicknesses in the range of 10-1000 nm. As a first step toward evaluating practical utility of the anodes, their performance in Na||SPAN cells with N:P ratio close to 1:1 is evaluated.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon, as the most promising commercial anode materials of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), has suffered from the coupling limitations on initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), capacity, and rate capability. Herein, to break such coupling limitations, sulfur-rich nitrogen-doped carbon nanomaterials (S-NC) were synthesized by a synergistic modification strategy, including structure/morphology regulation and dual heteroatom doping. The small specific surface area of S-NC is beneficial for inhibiting excessive growth of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film and irreversible interfacial reaction. The covalent S can serve as active electrochemical sites by Faradaic reactions and provide extra capacity. Benefit by N, S co-doping, S-NC shows large interlayer spacing, high defects, good electronic conductivity, strong ion adsorption performance, and fast Na+ ion transport, which combined with a more significant pore volume result in speedier reaction kinetics. Hence, S-NC possesses a high reversible specific capacity of 464.7 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 with a high ICE of 50.7%, excellent rate capability (209.8 mAh g-1 at 10.0 A g-1), and superb long-cycle capability delivering a capacity of 229.0 mAh g-1 (85% retention) after 1800 cycles at 5.0 A g-1.",

        "abstract": "Na metal is a promising anode material for the preparation of next-generation high-energy-density sodium-ion batteries; however, the high reactivity of Na metal severely limits the choice of electrolyte. In addition, rapid charge-discharge battery systems require electrolytes with high Na-ion transport properties. Herein, we demonstrate a stable and high-rate sodium-metal battery enabled by a nonaqueous polyelectrolyte solution composed of a weakly coordinating polyanion-type Na salt, poly[(4-styrenesulfonyl)-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide] (poly(NaSTFSI)) copolymerized with butyl acrylate, in a propylene carbonate solution. It was found that this concentrated polyelectrolyte solution exhibited a remarkably high Na-ion transference number (tNaPP = 0.9) and a high ionic conductivity (σ = 1.1 mS cm-1) at 60 °C. Furthermore, the surface of the Na electrode was modified with polyanion chains anchored via the partial decomposition of the electrolyte. The surface-tethered polyanion layer effectively suppressed the subsequent decomposition of the electrolyte, thereby enabling stable Na deposition/dissolution cycling. Finally, an assembled sodium-metal battery with a Na0.44MnO2 cathode demonstrated an outstanding charge/discharge reversibility (Coulombic efficiency >99.8%) over 200 cycles while also exhibiting a high discharge rate (i.e., 45% capacity retention at 10 mA cm-2).",

In the present study, we use first-principles calculations to investigate the performance of 2D Mg2C as anode materials for Li, Na, K and Ca-ions batteries. The calculated average open-circuit voltage are 0.37, 0.50, 0.03 and 0.06 eV vs Li, Na, K, Ca. No significant structural deformations are observed on the 2D Mg2C upon the adsorption of Li, Na, K or Ca and the metallic characteristic of the 2D Mg2C is retained. The metallic behaviour of both pristine and adsorbed Mg2C ensures the desirable electric conductivity, implying the advantages of 2D Mg2C for batteries. The Na and K atoms show an extremely high diffusivity on the 2D Mg2C with a low energy barrier of 0.08 and 0.04 eV respectively, which is about an order of magnitude smaller than that of Li atom. For the Na and K atoms, the theoretical storage capacity can reach up to 1770 mAh g−1, nearly two times that of the Li atom of 885 mAh g−1. Our study suggests that the 2D Mg2C is a promising anode material which offers a fast ion diffusion and high storage capacity.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have attracted worldwide attention as potential alternatives for large scale stationary energy storage due to the rich reserves and low cost of sodium resources. However, the practical application of sodium-ion batteries is restricted by unsatisfying capacity and poor rate capability. Herein, a novel mechanism of improving both interfacial and surface charge transfer is proposed by fabricating a graphene oxide/SnO2/Co3O4 nanocomposite through a simple hydrothermal method. The formation of heterostructures between ultrafine SnO2 and Co3O4 could enhance the charge transfer of interfaces owing to the internal electric field. The pseudocapacitive effect, which is led by the high specific area and the existence of ultrafine nanoparticles, takes on a feature of fast faradaic surface charge-transfer. Benefiting from the synergistic advantages of the heterostructures and the pseudocapacitive effect, the as-prepared graphene oxide/SnO2/Co3O4 anode achieved a high reversible capacity of 461 mA h g-1 after 80 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g-1. Additionally, at a high current density of 1 A g-1, a high reversible capacity of 241 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles is obtained. A full cell coupled by the as-prepared graphene oxide/SnO2/Co3O4 anode and the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode was also constructed, which exhibited a reversible capacity of 310.3 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 1 A g-1.

Here, sulfur-defective vanadium sulfide/carbon fiber composites (D-V5S8/CNFs) are designed and fabricated by a facile electrospinning method, followed by sulfuration treatment. The unique architecture, in which V5S8 nanoparticles are confined inside the carbon fiber, provides a short-range channel and abundant adsorption sites for ion storage. Moreover, enlarged interlayer spacings could also alleviate the volume changes, and offer small vdW interactions and ionic diffusion resistance to store more Na and K ions reversibly and simultaneously. The DFT calculations further demonstrate that sulfur defects can effectively facilitate the adsorption behavior of Na+ and K+ and offer low energy barriers for ion intercalation. Taking advantage of the functional integration of these merits, the D-V5S8/CNF anode exhibits excellent storage performance and long-term cycling stability. It reveals a high capacity of 462 mA h g-1 at a current density of 0.2 A g-1 in SIBs, while it is 350 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 in PIBs, as well as admirable long-term cycling characteristics (190 mA h g-1/17 000 cycles/5 A g-1 for SIBs and 165 mA h g-1/3000 cycles/1 A g-1 for PIBs).

        "title": "Impact of Electrolyte Salts on Na Storage Performance for High-Surface-Area Carbon Anodes.",
        "abstract": "High-surface-area carbon (HSAC) has been regarded as one of the most promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. However, it generally suffers from low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), which is closely related to the formation process of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Herein, the impact of different electrolyte salts on the electrochemical performance and SEI formation of a commercial HSAC anode is studied. It is found that the use of NaCF3SO3 enables much higher ICE (69.28%) and reversible capacity (283 mA h g-1) of the HSAC anode compared with the NaPF6 electrolyte (59.65%, 243 mA h g-1). Through comprehensive characterizations, the improvement in electrochemical performance facilitated by NaCF3SO3 could be attributed to the reduced amount of NaxC and the thinner SEI formed on the surface of HSAC during the initial cycle, which not only provides extra active sites for Na+ storage but also contributes to the promoted ICE. This work not only provides a deeper understanding of the role of electrolyte salt in SEI formation in the HSAC anode but also proposes a new method to further promote the ICE of the HSAC anode in sodium-ion batteries.",

        "title": "Effect of the Particle-Size Distribution on the Electrochemical Performance of a Red Phosphorus–Carbon Composite Anode for Sodium-Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "Red phosphorus (RP) is a promising candidate as an anode for sodium-ion batteries because of its low potential and high specific capacity. It has two main disadvantages. First, it experiences 490% volumetric expansion during sodiation, which leads to particle pulverization and substantial reduction of the cycle life. Second, it has an extremely low electronic conductivity of 10–14 S cm–1. Both issues can be addressed by ball milling RP with a carbon matrix to form a composite of electronically conductive carbon and small RP particles, less susceptible to pulverization. Through this procedure, however, the resulting particle-size distribution of the RP particles is difficult to determine because of the presence of the carbon particles. Here, we quantify the relationship between the RP particle-size distribution and its cycle life for the first time by separating the ball-milling process into two steps. The RP is first wet-milled to reduce the particle size, and then the particle-size distribution is measured via dynamic light scattering. This is followed by a dry-milling step to produce RP–graphite composites. We found that wet milling breaks apart the largest RP particles in the range of 2–10 μm, decreases the Dv90 from 1.85 to 1.26 μm, and significantly increases the cycle life of the RP. Photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy confirm the successful formation of a carbon coating, with longer milling times leading to more uniform carbon coatings. The RP with a Dv90 of 0.79 μm mixed with graphite for 48 h delivered 1354 mA h g–1 with high coulombic efficiency (>99%) and cyclability (88% capacity retention after 100 cycles). These results are an important step in the development of cyclable, high-capacity anodes for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The stability of aqueous Z inc (Zn) ion energy storage devices is significantly compromised by the instability at the electrode/electrolyte interface, which can result in the growth of Zn dendrites, self‐corrosion, and various other side reactions. Regulating the Zn‐ion （Zn2+) solvation structure through electrolyte additives has been proved to be effective strategy in stabilizing the Zn anode, but the influence of free water on the solvation structure is often lacking in‐depth exploration. Herein, the piperazine‐N,N‐bis(2‐hydroxypropanesulfonic acid) sodium salt (POPSO‐Na) is presented as a multifunctional electrolyte additive, which enhances the stability of the Zn anode by modulating the deposition and stripping environment of Zn2⁺ and limiting the presence of free water in the electrolyte during cycling. Theoretical calculation and experimental results demonstrate that the POPSO‐Na additive can not only replace the structural water around Zn2+ to destroy the original solvation sheath, but also form reverse micelle interface structure to hinder the proton transition and constrain the free water in the electrolyte. Thus, the Zn||Zn battery utilizing the ZnSO4+POPSO‐Na electrolyte exhibits an impressive cycle life of 1600 h at a current density of 1 mA cm−2, achieving an average Coulomb efficiency (CE) of ≈100%, which is significantly better than that observed with the ZnSO4 electrolyte. Moreover, the Zn||Cu battery with ZnSO4+POPSO‐Na electrolyte achieves high stability even after cycling for over 2000 h.",

However, a lack of suitable anode materials has become a key obstacle for the development of SIBs. Here we explore the potential of the two-dimensional (2D) Y-C space and identify a novel anode material for SIBs, a new Y4C3 sheet with P3̄m1 crystal symmetry, by means of first-principles swarm structure calculations. This Y4C3P3̄m1 structure has rather good kinetic and thermodynamic stability, possesses intrinsic metallicity, and remains metallic after adsorbing Na atoms, ensuring good electrical conductivity during the SIB cycle. Remarkably, a Y4C3 sheet as an anode for SIBs possesses the essential properties of a high specific capacity (∼752 mA h g-1), a low barrier energy (∼0.1 eV), and suitable open-circuit voltage (0-0.15 V). These characteristics are comparable and even superior to those of another known 2D Y2C anode material, indicating that the Y4C3 sheet can act as an appealing new candidate as an anode material for SIBs and offering new insights into the 2D Y-C space.",

        "abstract": "The current strong interest in electromotive mobility and the need to transition to an energy grid with sustainable storage devices has led to a renewed interest in sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Hard carbons (HCs) are promising candidates for high-capacity negative electrode materials in SIBs. Their high capacities, however, are often accompanied with high irreversible capacity losses during the initial cycles.[1]\n Generally, large losses can be connected to irreversible reactions, e.g., the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), during the initial sodiation of the HC-material. However, high irreversible capacity values are often in contradiction to the experimentally determined low surface area of the sample material.[1] A better understanding of the structure-property relationship should enable quantification and understanding of the potential of hard carbon materials for SIBs. Hence, the aim is to use analytical techniques to establish a correlation between the structure and the electrochemical characteristics of HC-materials. This has previously been difficult, in part because the sodium storage mechanism is not stoichiometric and due to the disordered structure of HCs.\n In order to tackle the aforementioned challenges, our approach is to explore whether a core-shell structure can separate sodium storage and solid electrolyte interphase formation. Thus, storage capacity and irreversible losses could be investigated and finally optimized separately. The synthesis of a selection of porous carbon structures serving as the core material, will be attempted. Simultaneously, sodium-conducting shell structures will be developed to allow for separation of sodium ions and electrolyte molecules. Subsequently, the combination of core and shell materials will be undertaken. These anodes should enable high capacities accompanied with low irreversible losses due to optimized SEI-formation.\n Literature:\n [1] Matsukawa, Y.; Linsenmann, F.; Plass, M.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are promising alternatives to replace lithium-ion batteries as future energy storage batteries because of their abundant sodium resources, low cost, and high charging efficiency. In order to match the high energy capacity and density, designing an atomically doped carbonous material as the anode is presently one of the important strategies to commercialize SIBs. In this work, we report the preparation of high-performance dual-atom-doped carbon (C) materials using low-cost corn starch and thiourea (CH4N2S) as the precursors. The electronegativity and radii of the doped atoms and C are different, which can vary the embedding properties of sodium ions (Na+) into/on C. As sulfur (S) can effectively expand the layer spacing, it provides more channels for embedding and de-embedding Na+. The synergistic effect of N and S co-doping can remarkably boost the performance of SIBs. The capacity is preserved at 400 mAh g −1 after 200 cycles at 500 mA g−1; more notably, the initial Coulombic efficiency is 81%. Even at a high rate of high current of 10 A g−1, the cell capacity can still reach 170 mAh g−1. More importantly, after 3000 cycles at 1 A g−1, the capacity decay is less than 0.003% per cycle, which demonstrates its excellent electrochemical performance. These results indicate that high-performance carbon materials can be prepared using low-cost corn starch and thiourea.",

        "abstract": "Nonlithium metals such as sodium have attracted wide attention as a potential charge carrying ion for rechargeable batteries. Using in situ transmission electron microscopy in combination with density functional theory calculations, we probed the structural and chemical evolution of SnO2 nanowire anodes in Na-ion batteries and compared them quantitatively with results from Li-ion batteries (Huang, J. Y.; et al. Science 2010, 330, 1515 - 1520). Upon Na insertion into SnO2, a displacement reaction occurs, leading to the formation of amorphous NaxSn nanoparticles dispersed in Na2O matrix. With further Na insertion, the NaxSn crystallized into Na15Sn4 (x = 3.75). Upon extraction of Na (desodiation), the NaxSn transforms to Sn nanoparticles. Associated with the dealloying, pores are found to form, leading to a structure of Sn particles confined in a hollow matrix of Na2O. These pores greatly increase electrical impedance, therefore accounting for the poor cyclability of SnO2. DFT calculations indicate that Na(+) diffuses 30 times slower than Li(+) in SnO2, in agreement with in situ TEM measurement. Insertion of Na can chemomechanically soften the reaction product to a greater extent than in lithiation. Therefore, in contrast to the lithiation of SnO2 significantly less dislocation plasticity was seen ahead of the sodiation front. This direct comparison of the results from Na and Li highlights the critical role of ionic size and electronic structure of different ionic species on the charge/discharge rate and failure mechanisms in these batteries.",

        "abstract": "Antimony- (Sb) based materials have been considered as one of promising anodes for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high theoretical capacities and appropriate sodium inserting potentials. So far, the reported energy density and cycling stability of the Sb-based anodes for SIBs are quite limited and need to be significantly improved. Here, we develop a novel Sb/C hybrid encapsulating the Sb nanorods into highly conductive N and S codoped carbon (Sb@(N, S-C)) frameworks. As an anode for SIBs, the Sb@(N, S-C) hybrid maintains high reversible capacities of 621.1 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 150 cycles, and 390.8 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 1000 cycles. At higher current densities of 2, 5, and 10 A g-1, the Sb@(N, S-C) hybrid also can display high reversible capacities of 534.4, 430.8, and 374.7 mAh g-1, respectively. Such impressive sodium storage properties are mainly attributed to the unique cross-linked carbon networks providing highly conductive frameworks for fast transfer of ions and electrons, alleviating the volume expansion and preventing the agglomeration of Sb nanorods during the cycling.",

        "abstract": "MoS2 , as a classical 2D material, becomes a capable anode candidate for sodium-ion batteries. However, MoS2 presents a disparate electrochemical performance in the ether-based and ester-based electrolyte with unclear mechanism. Herein, tiny MoS2 nanosheets embedded in nitrogen/sulfur-codoped carbon (MoS2 @NSC) networks are designed and fabricated through an uncomplicated solvothermal method. Thanks to the ether-based electrolyte, the MoS2 @NSC shows a unique capacity growth in the original stage of cycling. But in the ester-based electrolyte, MoS2 @NSC shows a usual capacity decay. The increasing capacity puts down to the gradual transformation from MoS2 to MoS3 with the structure reconstruction. Based on the above mechanism, MoS2 @NSC demonstrates an excellent recyclability and the specific capacity keeps around 286 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 after 5000 cycles with an ultralow capacity fading rate of only 0.0034% per cycle. In addition, a MoS2 @NSC‖Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 full cell with ether-based electrolyte is assembled and demonstrates a capacity of 71 mAh g-1 , suggesting the potential application of MoS2 @NSC. Here the electrochemical conversion mechanism of MoS2 is revealed in the ether-based electrolyte and significance of the electrolyte design on the promoting Na ion storage behavior is highlighted.",

        "title": "Tin and Tin Compounds for Sodium Ion Battery Anodes: Phase Transformations and Performance.",
        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (NIB, NAB, SIB) are attracting interest as a potentially lower cost alternative to lithium ion batteries (LIB), with readily available and geographically democratic reserves of the metal. Tin is one of most promising SIB anode materials, which alloys with up to 3.75 Na, leading to a charge storage capacity of 847 mAh g(-1). In this Account, we outline the state-of-the-art understanding regarding the sodiation-induced phase transformations and the associated performance in a range of Sn-based systems, treating metallic Sn and its alloys, tin oxide (SnO2), tin sulfide (SnS2/SnS), and tin phosphide (Sn4P3). We first detail what is known about the sodiation sequence in metallic Sn, highlighting the most recent insight into the reactions prior to the terminal equilibrium Na15Sn4 intermetallic. We explain why researchers argue that the equilibrium (phase diagram) series of phase transitions does not occur in this system, and rather why sodiation/desodiation proceeds through a series of metastable crystalline and amorphous structures. We also outline the recent modeling-based insight regarding how this phase transition profoundly influences the mechanical properties of the alloy, progressively changing the bonding and the near neighbor arrangement from \"Sn-like\" to \"Na-like\" in the process. We then go on to discuss the sodiation reactions in SnO2. We argue that while a substantial amount of experimental work already exists where the focus is on synthesis and testing of tin oxide-based nanocomposites, the exact sodiation sequence is just beginning to be understood. Unlike in Sn and Sn alloys, where capacities near the theoretical are reached at least early during cycling, SnO2 never quite achieves anything close to the 1398 mAh g(-1) that would be possible with a combination of fully reversible conversion and alloying reactions. We highlight recent work demonstrating that contrary to general expectations, it is the Sn to Na15Sn4 alloying reaction that is incomplete and hence limits the capacity of the electrode. We also describe how the oxide conversion reaction goes through an intermediate SnO phase, and how its reversibility in a half-cell is highly dependent on the terminal anodic voltage. We then present what is known about sodiation of tin sulfide and of tin phosphide phases, including emerging microstructural evidence that may explain why both the sulfides and the phosphides are unable to achieve their highly promising theoretical capacities under conventional electrode testing conditions. Finally, we provide a broad comparison of the capacity (cycling and rate) performance for a range of Sn based anode materials, and show that there may be indeed an optimum microstructural architecture.",

        "abstract": "Binders play a crucial role in the development of silicon (Si) anodes for lithium-ion batteries with high specific energy. The large volume change of Si (∼300%) during repeated discharge and charge processes causes the destruction and separation of electrode materials from the copper (Cu) current collector and ultimately results in poor cycling performance. In the present study, we design and prepare hydrogen-bonding cross-linked thiourea-based polymeric binders (denoted CMC-co-SN) in consideration of their excellent binding interaction with the Cu current collector and low cost as well. The CMC-co-SN binders are formed through in situ thermopolymerization of chain-type carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC) with thiourea (SN) in the drying process of Si electrode disks. A tight and physical interlocked layer between the CMC-co-SN binder and Cu current collector is derived from a dendritic nonstoichiometric copper sulfide (CuxS) layer on the interface and enhances the binding of electrode materials with the Cu current collector. When applying the CMC-co-SN binders to micro- (∼3 μm) (μSi) and nano- (∼50 nm) (nSi) Si particles, the Si anodes exhibit high initial Coulomb efficiency (91.5% for μSi and 83.2% for nSi) and excellent cyclability (1121 mA h g-1 for μSi after 140 cycles and 1083 mA h g-1 for nSi after 300 cycles). The results demonstrate that the CMC-co-SN binders together with a physical interlocked layer have significantly improved the electrochemical performance of Si anodes through strong binding forces with the current collector to maintain electrode integrity and avoid electric contact loss.",

        "abstract": "Manganese-based chalcogenides would be of latent capacity in serving as anodes for assembling lithium- and/or sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs) due to their large theoretical capacity, low price, and low-toxicity functionality, while the low electroconductivity and easy agglomeration behavior may impede their technical applications. Here, a solid-state solution of MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes in rock-salt phase has been synthesized for the first time at a relatively low temperature from the precursors of Mn(II) acetylacetonate with dibenzyl dichalcogens in oleylamine with octadecene, and the MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes have been assembled with N-doped graphene to form a new kind of heterostructured nanohybrids (shortened as MnS0.5Se0.5/N-G hybrids), which are very potential for the fabrication of metal-ion batteries including LIBs and/or SIBs. Investigations revealed that there have been dense vacancies generated and active sites increased via nonequilibrium alloying of MnS and MnSe into the solid-solution MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes with segregation and defects achieved in the low-temperature solution synthetic route. Meanwhile, the introduction of N-doped graphene forming heterojunction interfaces between MnS0.5Se0.5 and N-doped graphene would efficiently enhance their electroconductivity and avoid agglomeration of the active MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes with considerably improved electrochemical properties. As a result, the MnS0.5Se0.5/N-G hybrids delivered superior Li/Na storage capacities with outstanding rate performance as well as satisfactorily lasting stability (1039/457 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 for LIBs/SIBs). Additionally, full-cell LIBs of the anodic MnS0.5Se0.5/N-G constructed with cathodic LiFePO4 (LFP) further confirmed the promising future for their practical application.",

        "abstract": "MXenes are mentioned in many applications due to their unique properties. However, the traditional etching method has a lengthy synthesis time, dangerous process, and high cost. Molten salt etching is not only short in time but also safe and simple, laying a good foundation for industrialization. Here, we compare the traditional F‐containing etching method with the molten salt etching method. Transmission electron microscopy elemental mapping images and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy show that the Ti3C2Tx surface end of traditional etching is terminated by –F, while the Ti3C2Tx surface end of molten salt etching is terminated by –Cl. Finally, the sodium‐ion batteries are fabricated and the performance difference of the three etching methods is compared. The results show that the capacity of 102.1 mAh g–1 can still be reached when the molten salt etching MXene material returns to 0.1 A g–1 after the current density of 5 A g–1. After 500 cycles at 1 A g–1, there is no significant loss of capacity and the Coulomb efficiency is close to 100%. This work describes that molten salt etching MXene has comparable sodium storage capacity to conventional F‐containing etched MXene, making it a potential candidate for the production of large‐scale sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The poor reversibility of the zinc (Zn) anodes and the irreversible deposition/dissolution of Mn2+/MnO2 significantly impede the commercialization of Zn–Mn aqueous batteries (ZMABs). In reducing the difference between the desired interfacial reaction environments of the cathode and anode, we found that they face the same problem of interference-the generation of irreversible corrosion products. Herein, we have introduced a novel self-regulatory mechanism. This mechanism involves the addition of sodium dihydrogen phosphate, which shifts from passive protection to active regulation. It effectively captures OH− ions, prevents corrosion product formation, and facilitates the in situ generation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film. This modification also homogenizes Zn ion flow and improves the reversibility of Zn plating and stripping. Furthermore, a stable and slightly acidic environment has been established to stabilize the pH at the cathodic interface, mitigate corrosion product formation, and enhance the reversible deposition and dissolution of Mn2+/MnO2. With the optimal electrolyte, Zn‖Zn symmetric cells demonstrate stable operation for over 3000 hours at 1 mA cm−2, 1 mA h cm−2. Additionally, the Zn‖Cu cells maintain high reversibility after 1000 cycles, achieving an average coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.76%. The assembled Zn‖MnO2 full cells exhibit exceptional cycling stability and rate performance. This work adopts the approach of seeking common ground and emphasizing the balance of cathode and anode interfacial requirements, which represents a new and significant insight for design of ZMABs with high reversibility and high cyclability.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) have attracted much attention due to integrating the high energy density of battery and high out power of supercapacitors. However, rapid Na+ diffusion kinetics in cathode is counterbalanced with sluggish anode, hindering the further advancement and commercialization of SIHCs. Here, aiming at conversion-type metal sulfide anode, taking typical VS2 as an example, a comprehensive regulation of nanostructure and electronic properties through NH4 + pre-intercalation and Mo-doping VS2 (Mo-NVS2 ) is reported. It is demonstrated that NH4 + pre-intercalation can enlarge the interplanar spacing and Mo-doping can induce interlayer defects and sulfur vacancies that are favorable to construct new ion transport channels, thus resulting in significantly enhanced Na+ diffusion kinetics and pseudocapacitance. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that the introduction of NH4 + and Mo-doping enhances the electronic conductivity, lowers the diffusion energy barrier of Na+ , and produces stronger d-p hybridization to promote conversion kinetics of Na+ intercalation intermediates. Consequently, Mo-NVS2 delivers a record-high reversible capacity of 453 mAh g-1 at 3 A g-1 and an ultra-stable cycle life of over 20 000 cycles. The assembled SIHCs achieve impressive energy density/power density of 98 Wh kg-1 /11.84 kW kg-1 , ultralong cycling life of over 15000 cycles, and very low self-discharge rate (0.84 mV h-1 ).",

        "abstract": "Urchin-type cobalt phosphide microparticles assembled by nanorod is encapsulated in graphene framework membrane (CoP@GF), and used as a binder-free electrode for alkali metal ion batteries. Electrochemical measurements indicate that this membrane exhibits enhanced reversible lithium, sodium, and potassium storage capabilities. Moreover, the energy storage properties of CoP@GF electrodes in alkali metal ion batteries display an order of Li > Na > K. DFT calculations on adsorption energy of CoP surfaces for Li, Na, and K indicated that CoP surfaces is more favorable to transfer electrons to Li atoms than Na and K, and the surface reactivity can be ordered as Li-CoP > Na-CoP > K-CoP, thus CoP@GF exhibit better storage capacity for lithium. This work provides experimental and theoretical basis for understand the electrochemical performance of cobalt phosphide-based membrane for alkali metal ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Metal phosphides exhibit high energy densities as hosts for lithium/sodium storage owing to their conversion reaction mechanism. Nevertheless, they typically suffer from inferior reversibility and cyclability because of the dissolution of polyphosphides and sluggish electrochemical kinetics. Herein, a series of dual‐bond confined MXene‐MxPy‐G composites have been fabricated, in which MxPy nanoparticles are strongly bound with MXene and graphene nanosheets via Ti─P and C‐P bonds. On one hand, the dual‐bond confinement offers strong adsorption to trap polyphosphides, greatly stabilizing the conversion‐formed products during cycling. On the other hand, dual‐bond immobilization largely promotes electron transfer and ion diffusion, facilitating the reversibility of conversion reactions. As anticipated, these MXene‐MxPy‐G hybrids demonstrate superb lithium/sodium‐storage performance. Particularly, as an anode for lithium‐ion batteries, the MXene‐Sn4P3‐G delivers a high initial coulombic efficiency of 90.1% and a high reversible capacity of 1058.6 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1. Even tested at high rates of 1.0/2.0 A g−1, it can still maintain high reversible capacities of 820.6/726.5 mAh g−1 after 1450 cycles. When applied in pouch full‐cells and sodium‐ion batteries, it also shows extended cyclic lifespans of 350 and 1200 cycles. This work provides new insights to improve the reversibility and cyclability of conversion‐type anodes.",

This is due to their promising electrochemical performance with capacities of 200-300 mAh g-1 and stable long-term cycling.

Many biological or waste materials have been used to synthesize hard carbons but the impact of the precursors on the final properties of the anode material is not fully understood. In this study the impact of the biomass source on the structural and electrochemical properties of hard carbons is unraveled by using different, representative types of biomass as examples. The systematic structural and electrochemical investigation of hard carbons derived from different sources-namely corncobs, peanut shells, and waste apples, which are representative of hemicellulose-, lignin- and pectin-rich biomass, respectively-enables understanding and interlinking of the structural and electrochemical properties.",

        "abstract": "Exploiting novel nanomaterials with fast and durable sodium/potassium ion storage capability is key to alleviate the application limitations of lithium-ion batteries. Herein, a novel energy storage material based on cobalt metaphosphate nanosheet arrays self-supported on carbon cloths [Co(PO3)2 NSs/CC] is fabricated by a two-step strategy. This rationally designed strategy avoids the preparation of the complex {Co[O2P(OtBu)2]2}n precursor, which significantly simplifies the synthesis process. The active CC acts not only as an electrically conductive substrate as usual but also as a functional basis to suppress PH3-involved reaction and to promote HPO3-involved reaction during the phosphating process, contributing to the formation of Co(PO3)2. The mutual cross-linked porous Co(PO3)2 nanosheets vertically grow on the surface of activated CC, ensuring sufficient electrolyte infiltration and fast electron transport among the electrodes. Sodium ion storage analysis for the Co(PO3)2 NSs/CC electrode reveals a multi-step reaction mechanism with high reversibility, as reflected by the high reversible capacity (667 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1) and excellent cyclability (with almost no capacity decay over 500 cycles). This novel electrode is also well capable of storing potassium ions, exhibiting high reversible capacity, which outperforms most reported anodes for potassium-ion batteries. The development of this novel high-performance nanomaterial would advance the performance of sodium/potassium-ion batteries toward practical applications.",

        "abstract": "TiO2 as an anode for sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) has attracted much recent attention, but poor cyclability and rate performance remain problematic owing to the intrinsic electronic conductivity and the sluggish diffusivity of Na ions in the TiO2 matrix. Herein, a simple process is demonstrated to improve the sodium storage performance of TiO2 by fabricating a 1D, multichannel, porous binary-phase anatase-TiO2 -rutile-TiO2 composite with oxygen-deficient and high grain-boundary density (denoted as a-TiO2-x /r-TiO2-x ) via electrospinning and subsequent vacuum treatment. The introduction of oxygen vacancies in the TiO2 matrix enables enhanced intrinsic electronic conductivity and fast sodium-ion diffusion kinetics. The porous structure offers easy access of the liquid electrolyte and a short transport path of Na+ through the pores toward the TiO2 nanoparticle. Furthermore, the high density of grain boundaries between the anatase TiO2 and rutile TiO2 offer more interfaces for a novel interfacial storage. The a-TiO2-x /r-TiO2-x shows excellent long cycling stability (134 mAh g-1 at 10 C after 4500 cycles) and superior rate performance (93 mAh g-1 after 4500 cycles at 20 C) for sodium-ion batteries.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (NaIBs) are increasingly being envisioned for grid-scale energy storage systems because of cost advantages. However, implementation of this vision has been challenged by the low energy densities delivered by most NaIB cathodes. Toward addressing this challenge, the authors report the synthesis and characterization of a new iron-doped Na3Fe0.3V1.7O(PO4)2F2 cathode using a novel facile hydrothermal route. The synthesized material was characterized using x ray diffraction, Mössbauer spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy techniques. Obtained discharge capacity in half-cell configuration lies from 119 to 125 to 130 mAh/g at C/10 while tested using three different electrolyte formulations, DMC-EC-PC, DEC-EC, and EC-PC, respectively. The synthesized cathodes were also evaluated in full-cell configurations, which delivered an initial discharge capacity of 80 mAh/g with NaTi2(PO4)3MWCNT as the anode. Ionic diffusivity and interfacial charge transfer kinetics were also evaluated as a function of temperature and sodium concentration, which revealed that electrochemical rate performances in this material were limited by charge transfer kinetics. To understand the heat generation mechanism of the Na/Na3Fe0.3V1.7O(PO4)2F2 half-cell during charge and discharge processes, an electrochemical isothermal calorimetry measurement was carried out at different current rates for two different temperatures (25 and 45°C). The results showed that the amount of heat generated was strongly affected by the operating charge/discharge state, C-rate, and temperature. Overall, this work provides a new synthesis route for the development of iron-doped Na3Fe0.3V1.7O(PO4)2F2-based high-performance sodium cathode material aimed at providing a viable pathway for the development and deployment of large-scale energy storage based on sodium battery systems.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) has been widely adopted as the anode material for sodium ion batteries (NIBs). However, it is troubled by a low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) due to its porous structure. Herein, a graphitized and ultrathin carbon layer coating on HC is proposed to solve this challenge. The as-prepared porous carbon material coated with an ultrathin carbon layer composite (PCS@V@C) exhibits a cavity structure, which is prepared by using bis(cyclopentadienyl) nickel (CP-Ni) as the carbon source for outer coating, glucose carbon spheres as porous carbon, and introducing a silica layer to facilitate the coating process. When utilized as the anode for NIBs, the material shows an ICE increase from 47.1% to 85.3%, and specific capacity enhancement at 0.1 A g-1 from 155.3 to 216.7 mA h g-1. Moreover, its rate capability and cycling performance are outstanding, demonstrating a capacity of 140.3 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1, and a retaining capacity of 225.6 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 with the Coulombic efficiency of 100% at the second cycle. The excellent electrochemical performance of the PCS@V@C is attributed to the ultrathin carbon layer, which is beneficial for the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film. Therefore, this study provides a feasible surface modification method for the preparation of anode materials for NIBs with high specific capacity and ICE.",

Still, major drawbacks for the commercial application of SIBs lie in the slow kinetic processes and poor cycling performance of the devices. In this work, a hybrid nanocomposite of Sb2O3 nanoparticles anchored on N-doped graphene nanoribbons (GNR) is implemented as anode material in SIBs. The obtained Sb2O3/N-GNR anode delivers a reversible specific capacity of 642 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 and exhibits a good rate capability. Even after 500 cycles at 5 A g−1, the specific capacity is maintained at about 405 mA h g−1. Such good Na storage performance is mainly ascribed to the beneficial effect of N doping for charge transfer and to the improved microstructure that facilitates the Na+ diffusion through the overall electrode.",

However, their practical application is hindered by the unstable electrolyte and interfacial chemistry at the high-voltage cathode and anode-free side, especially under extreme temperature conditions. Here, an advanced electrolyte design strategy based on electrolyte solvation engineering is presented, which shapes a weakly solvating anion-stabilized (WSAS) electrolyte by balancing the interaction between the Na+-solvent and Na+-anion. The special interaction constructs rich contact ion pairs (CIPs) /aggregates (AGGs) clusters at the electrode/electrolyte interface during the dynamic solvation process which facilitates the formation of a uniform and stable interfacial layer, enabling highly stable cycling of 4.0 V-class layered oxide cathode from -40 °C to 60 °C and excellent reversibility of Na plating/stripping with an ultrahigh average CE of 99.89%. Ultimately, industrial multi-layer anode-free pouch cells using the WSAS electrolyte achieve 80% capacity remaining after 50 cycles and even deliver 74.3% capacity at -30 °C.

The metallic feature of the BGe monolayer can be maintained after absorbing different numbers of Na atoms, ensuring good electronic conductivity during the charge/discharge process. The calculated migration energy barrier, open-circuit voltage, and theoretical specific capacity of the BGe monolayer are much better than those of some other two-dimensional (2D) materials.

The key to this strategy lies in the chemical cross-linking reaction between polyphosphoric acid and p-phenylenediamine, associated with pyrolysis induced in-situ self-activation that creates mesoporous structures and rich heteroatoms within the carbon matrix. Thanks to the enlarged interlayer spacing, reduced ion diffusion length, and plentiful active sites, the obtained NPSC delivers a superb rate capacity of 215 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1 and an ultralong cycle life of 4,700 cycles at 5 A g−1. Remarkably, the full cell shows 99% capacity retention during 100 continuous cycles, and maximum energy and power densities of 191 Wh kg−1 and 9.2 kW kg−1, respectively.

        "abstract": "Nowadays, great attention is being directed towards the development of promising electrode materials for non-lithium rechargeable batteries such as sodium and calcium ion batteries (SIBs and CIBs), due to their large abundance, storage capacity and charge/discharge rate. Using density functional theory (DFT) based computations we have predicted that the recently synthesized bilayer s-tetrazine based covalent organic framework (bilayer TZACOF) may be a promising anode material for sodium and calcium ion batteries. The electronic band structure calculations suggest that the bilayer TZACOF is an indirect band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 0.95 eV. The sodium and calcium atoms are adsorbed on the bilayer TZACOF at the most energetically favorable adsorption sites with adsorption energies of -1.37 eV and -2.27 eV, respectively. Moreover, the diffusion energy barriers for the migration of sodium and calcium atoms on the bilayer TZACOF are 0.19 eV and 0.63 eV, respectively, which indicates the fast ion mobility and charge/discharge rate. The theoretical specific capacity (TSC) of the bilayer TZACOF as the electrode material for SIBs and CIBs is 618.69 and 412.46 mA h g-1, respectively. Furthermore, the average voltage of the bilayer TZACOF as the electrode material for SIBs and CIBs is found to be 0.96 and 1.13 V, respectively. Based on the results of rich electronic properties, low diffusion barriers, high storage capacity, and low average voltage, we can reach at the conclusion that the bilayer TZACOF may be a suitable candidate for use as an anode material for sodium and calcium ion batteries (SIBs and CIBs).",

        "abstract": "Tin diselenide, a promising anode material for sodium ion batteries (SIBs), still faces sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics and severe volume change, resulting in undesirable cycling stability and rate capability. Heterostructure construction is an effective strategy for boosting Na+ storage of SnSe2. Herein, an appealing yolk‐shell nanostructure of SnSe2/NiSe2 heterointerface with rich Se vacancies embedded into N‐doped carbon (SnSe2/NiSe2@NC) is precisely designed through a facile hydrothermal process followed by a selenization strategy. The experimental studies coupled with theoretical calculations results verify that the heterostructure interfaces and Se vacancies accelerate the charge and Na+ transfer efficiency, improve Na+ adsorption energy and supply ample active sites. The yolk‐shell nanostructure and N‐doped carbon buffer the volume variation and improve the structural stability of the electrode material during sodium storage processes. The SnSe2/NiSe2@NC delivers ultra‐long term cycling stability (322.7 mAh g−1 after 7500 cycles at 3 A g−1) and exceptional rate capability (314.6 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1). The Na‐ion storage mechanism of SnSe2/NiSe2@NC is explored through in situ X‐ray diffraction and ex situ high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis. The present work provides an effective avenue to the rational design of heterostructure anode materials for high efficiency SIBs.",

The sodium-ion battery anode, including carbon-based materials, alloy materials, and organic materials, plays a key role in improving battery performance but also faces problems such as poor conductivity, which limits sodium storage capacity attenuation and irreversible volume expansion. To solve these problems, researchers have proposed a variety of solutions, such as chemical activation, element doping, micro-nanostructure design, composite material preparation, surface coating application, and buffer medium introduction. This article summarizes these strategies and points out the direction of future research, including the development of innovative anode materials with better conductivity and sodium storage capacity, and improved manufacturing processes.

Lithium ions could enhance the charge transfer during CDI desalination, while NaTi2(PO4)3/C provided direct intercalation sites for sodium ions. The electrochemical capacities of the battery electrodes fitted well, which was favorable for the optimization of the desalination capacity. The low potential of the redox couple Ti3+/Ti4+ (−0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl) and intercalation/deintercalation behaviors of sodium ions that suppressed hydrogen evolution could enlarge the voltage window of the CDI process to 1.8 V.

        "abstract": "In recent years, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted a lot of attention and are considered an ideal alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The hard carbon (HC) anode in SIBs presents a unique challenge for studying the formation process of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during initial cycling, owing to its distinctive porous structure. This study employs a combination of ultrasonic scanning techniques and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry to conduct an in-depth analysis of the two-dimensional distribution and composition of gases during the formation process. The findings reveal distinct gas evolution behaviors in SIBs compared to LIBs during formation. Notably, significant gas evolution is observed during the discharge phase of the formation cycle in SIBs, with higher discharge rates leading to increased gas evolution rates. This phenomenon is likely attributed to the adsorption of CO2 gas by the abundant pores in HC, followed by desorption during discharge. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the addition of 5A molecular sieves, which competitively adsorb gases, effectively reduces gas adsorption on the anode during formation, thereby significantly enhancing battery performance. This research elucidates the gas adsorption and desorption behavior at the battery interface, providing new insights into the SEI formation process in SIBs.",

Recent advances in the lithium-ion-battery field have expanded our understanding of electrolyte compositions and stability, paving the way for better sodium-ion-battery electrolytes. Two of the most promising new classes of electrolytes are evaluated herein with a sodium layered-oxide cathode, for the first time: a localized high-concentration electrolyte (LHCE) composed of sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide, dimethyl ether, and tetrafluoropropyl ether and a \"highly fluorinated\" electrolyte (HFE) composed of 20% fluoroethylene carbonate with a lithium difluorophosphate additive. With a combination of electrochemical and post-mortem characterization techniques, the stability of each electrolyte is assessed with the O3-type Na(Ni0.3Fe0.4Mn0.3)O2 cathode and sodium metal anode. Both electrolytes significantly improve the surface and bulk stability of the cathode, but only the LHCE has a meaningful improvement on sodium metal stability.

        "abstract": "In recent times, few-layer black phosphorus (BP) has attracted tremendous attention as a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries due to its particular two-dimensional structure, good electron conductivity, and high theoretical capacity. The main disadvantages of BP-based materials are the lower practical specific capacity of the BP-based composite than expectation because of the low P atom utilization and the structural fracture due to the large volume expansion that occurs during sodiation/desodiation cycles. In this work, we report a ternary composite comprising BP, graphite, and polyaniline (BP-G/PANI) with a BP mass content of ∼65 wt %. The ternary composite provides an optimized ion pathway (electrolyte → PANI → BP-G → BP), which reduces the charge transfer resistance of the electrode. Also, further ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that the presence of graphite in the BP-G composite allows a deep sodiation of BP and also leads to a higher sodiation/desodiation reversibility. In addition, the uniformly coated PANI also restricts the huge volume expansion of the BP electrode through discharge/charge processes, which promise the stable cycling performance of BP-G/PANI. Thus, our composite shows a high reversible gravimetric capacity of 1530 mAh gcompo.-1 at 0.25 A g-1 and a capacity retention of 520 mAh gcompo.-1 after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 4 A g-1.",

        "abstract": "Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a commonly used coating technique for lithium ion battery electrodes. Recently, it has been applied to sodium ion battery anode materials. ALD is known to improve the cycling performance, Coulombic efficiency of batteries, and maintain electrode integrity. Here, the electrochemical performance of uncoated P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 electrodes is compared to that of ALD-coated Al2O3 P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 electrodes. Given that ALD coatings are in the early stage of development for NIB cathode materials, little is known about how ALD coatings, in particular aluminum oxide (Al2O3), affect the electrode-electrolyte interface. Therefore, full characterizations of its effects are presented in this work. For the first time, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to elucidate the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on ALD-coated electrodes. It contains less carbonate species and more inorganic species, which allows for fast Na kinetics, resulting in significant increase in Coulombic efficiency and decrease in cathode impedance. The effectiveness of Al2O3 ALD coating is also surprisingly reflected in the enhanced mechanical stability of the particle which prevents particle exfoliation.",

        "abstract": "The rational design of porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high conductivity and reversible redox activity is the key to improving their performance in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we report a series of COFs (FPDC-TPA-COF, FPDC-TPB-COF, and FPDC-TPT-COF) based on an organosulfur linker, (trioxocyclohexane-triylidene)tris(dithiole-diylylidene))hexabenzaldehyde (FPDC). These COFs feature two-dimensional crystalline structures, high porosity, good conductivity, and densely packed redox-active sites, making them suitable for energy storage devices. Among them, FPDC-TPT-COF demonstrates a remarkably high specific capacity of 420 mAh g-1 (0.2 A g-1), excellent cycling stability (~87% capacity retention after 3000 cycles, 1.0 A g-1) and high rate performance (339 mAh g-1 at 2.0 A g-1) as an anode for SIBs, surpassing most reported COF-based electrodes. The superior performance is attributed to the dithiole moieties enhancing the conductivity and the presence of redox-active carbonyl, imine, and triazine sites facilitating Na storage. Furthermore, the sodiation mechanism was elucidated through in-situ experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work highlights the advantages of integrating multiple functional groups into redox-active COFs for the rational design of efficient and stable SIBs.",

Paired with biocompatible and biodegradable polypyrrole, this full battery system shows excellent sodium storage ability and flexibility, indicating its potential applications in wearable electronics and biointegrated devices.

MoS2 nanoparticles were subsequently anchored on the flexible Ge/CNFs via hydrothermal synthesis. Flexible MoS2 anchored on Ge/CNFs (MoS2@Ge/CNFs) was used as a self-standing binder-free anode in an SIB. Because of the high electronic conductivity of CNFs and the many active sites of MoS2 nanoparticles, a high initial capacity of over 880 mAh/g was achieved at a current density of 0.1 A/g. Moreover, the flexible binder-free MoS2@Ge/CNFs exhibited an excellent C-rate performance with a reversible capacity of over 300 mAh/g at a current density of 2 A/g.

        "abstract": "The Fe‐based anode of sodium‐ion batteries attracts much attention due to the abundant source, low‐cost, and high specific capacity. However, the low electron and ion transfer rate, poor structural stability, and shuttle effect of NaS2 intermediate restrain its further development. Herein, the Fe3O4/Fe/FeS tri‐heterojunction node spawned N‐carbon nanotube scaffold structure (FHNCS) was designed using the modified MIL‐88B(Fe) as a template followed by catalytic growth and sulfidation process. During catalytic growth process, the reduced Fe monomers catalyze the growth of N‐doped carbon nanotubes to connect the Fe3O4/Fe/FeS tri‐heterojunction node, forming a 3D scaffold structure. Wherein the N‐doped carbon promotes the transfer of electrons between Fe3O4/Fe/FeS particles, and the tri‐heterojunction facilitates the diffusion of electrons at the interface, to organize a 3D conductive network. The unique scaffold structure provides more active sites and shortens the Na+ diffusion path. Meanwhile, the structure exhibits excellent mechanical stability to alleviate the volume expansion during circulation. Furthermore, the Fe in Fe3O4/Fe heterojunction can adjust the d‐band center of Fe in Fe3O4 to enhance the adsorption between Fe3O4 and Na2S intermediate, which restrains the shuttle effect. Therefore, the FHNCS demonstrates a high specific capacity of 436 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, 84.7% and 73.4% of the initial capacities are maintained after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 and 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1. We believe that this strategy gives an inspiration for constructing Fe‐based anode with excellent rate capability and cycling stability.",

However, silicon as an active anode material suffers from significant volume changes upon lithiation/delithiation, causing fast capacity fading. The performance of silicon anodes depends on the polymeric binders used, which form well‐bound Si particles matrices that accommodate the strains developed during their repeated lithiation, thus maintaining their integrity.\nHerein, we investigated the effect of thermal treatment on the performance of polyimide P84 as a novel binder for composite Si anodes comprising metallurgical micron‐size silicon particles (80% silicon). The electrochemical behavior of metallurgical silicon‐based anodes heat‐treated to 120°C, 200°C, 300°C, and 400°C was examined in half (vs. Li electrodes) and full (vs. NCM622 cathodes) cells. An optimal performance was obtained after heat treatment at 400°C, related to the very good adhesion of the electrode’s active mass to the current collector, and the ability of the heat‐treated binder to enhance the active mass integrity upon cycling.\nA comparison between optimized anodes developed herein to other Si anodes containing frequently used binders like Sodium Alginate (SA) and Lithium Polyacrylate (LiPAA), demonstrated clear advantages of the heat‐treated Si anodes containing P84.",

        "abstract": "SnSb alloy, which can be used as an anode in a sodium-ion cell, was synthesized following a resource-efficient route at low temperature. This one-pot approach greatly reduces the energy consumption and maximizes the efficient use of raw materials. The reaction of elemental tin and antimony in the ionic liquid (IL) trihexyltetradecylphosphonium chloride ([P66614]Cl) at 200 °C led to a microcrystalline powder of single-phase SnSb within 10 h with very high yield (95%). Liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that the IL remains essentially stable during the reaction. It was recovered almost quantitatively by distilling off the organic solvent used for product separation. Composites of SnSb powder and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were fabricated by a simple ball milling process. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the Na‖SnSb/CNTs cell retains close to 100% of its initial capacity after 50 cycles at a current of 50 mA g−1, which is much better than the Na‖SnSb cell. The greatly increased capacity retainability can be attributed to the conductive network formed by CNTs inside the SnSb/CNTs electrode, providing 3D effective and fast electronic pathways during sodium intercalation and de-intercalation.",

However, efficient phosphorus doping with high concentration in well-crystallized TiO2 nanoparticles is still a big challenge. Herein, we propose a defect-assisted phosphorus doping strategy to selectively engineer the surface structure of TiO2 nanoparticles. The reduced TiO2-x shell layer that is rich of oxygen defects and Ti3+ species precisely triggered high concentration of phosphorus doping (~7.8 at%) and consequently a TiO2@TiO2-x-P core@shell architecture was produced. Comprehensive characterizations and first-principle calculations proved that the surface functionalized TiO2-x-P thin layer endowed the TiO2@TiO2-x-P with substantially enhanced electronic conductivity and accelerated Na ions transportation, resulting in great rate capability (167 mA h g-1 at 10000 mA g-1) and stable cycling (99% after 5000 cycles at 10 A g-1). Combining in/ex situ X-ray diffraction with ex situ electron spin resonance clearly demonstrated the high reversibility and robust mechanical behavior of the TiO2@TiO2-x-P upon long-term cycling. This work provides an interesting and effective strategy for precise heteroatoms doping to improve the electrochemical performance of nanoparticles.",

        "abstract": "MXenes represent a large family of functionalized two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal carbides and carbonitrides. However, most of the understanding on their unique structures and applications stops at the theoretical suggestion and lack of experimental support. Herein, the surface structure and intercalation chemistry of Ti3C2X are clarified at the atomic scale by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The STEM studies show that the functional groups (e.g., OH(-), F(-), O(-)) and the intercalated sodium (Na) ions prefer to stay on the top sites of the centro-Ti atoms and the C atoms of the Ti3C2 monolayer, respectively. Double Na-atomic layers are found within the Ti3C2X interlayer upon extensive Na intercalation via two-phase transition and solid-solution reactions. In addition, aluminum (Al)-ion intercalation leads to horizontal sliding of the Ti3C2X monolayer. On the basis of these observations, the previous monolayer surface model of Ti3C2X is modified. DFT calculations using the new modeling help to understand more about their physical and chemical properties. These findings enrich the understanding of the MXenes and shed light on future material design and applications. Moreover, the Ti3C2X exhibits prominent rate performance and long-term cycling stability as an anode material for Na-ion batteries.",

Consequently, CSS, as a scalable and environmentally friendly method, can produce a binder-free electrode in just a few minutes, demonstrating its great potential in the industrial production of sodium-ion batteries.

The obtained results indicate, first, the satisfactory thermal stability of liquid Na-ion electrolytes, which start to decompose only at 270~300 °C. Second, we observed that charged vanadium-based polyanionic cathodes, which appear to be very stable in the “dry” state, demonstrate an increase in decomposition enthalpy and a shift of the DSC peaks to lower temperatures when in contact with 1 M NaPF6 in the EC:DEC solution. However, the greatest thermal effect from the “electrode–electrolyte” interaction is demonstrated by the anode material: the heat of decomposition of the soaked electrode in the charged state is almost 40% higher than the sum of the decomposition enthalpies of the electrolyte and dry electrode separately.",

As an anode material, the composite displays outstanding electrochemical performance for sodium-ion batteries. For instance, it delivers high reversible capacities (491 mA h g-1 after 50 cycles at 0.1 A g-1), high rate performance (387 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1) and long-term cycling stability (234 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 3000 cycles). Note that it shows one of the best long-term cycling properties reported to date for MoS2-based anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. This regulation strategy may offer new insights into the fabrication of high-performance anode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its abundance. However, it exhibits low reversible capacity and slow kinetics if inappropriate microstructural features are developed during synthesis. Herein, N/S co-doped phenolic resin-based hard carbon microspheres are prepared by a scalable strategy, and the electrochemical performance is assessed both in half cells and full cells. We demonstrate that the expanded interlayer spacing, the increased active sites, and the enhanced capacitive behavior result in the enhanced reversible capacity and promoted kinetics for Na+ storage. The sample with appropriate doping amount exhibits an initial charge capacity of 536.8 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and maintains 445.9 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g–1 in a Na-metal half cell. Coupled with a carbon-coated Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) cathode, the full cell exhibits a capacity of 92.5 mAh g−1 after 90 cycles, with a capacity retention of 91.6%.

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) is emerging as a popular cathode for sodium-ion batteries owing to its stable structure, high operating voltage, and large energy density. However, its practical application is hindered by its low conductivity. In addition, due to the loss of fluorine during synthesis, Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) impurity is often easily generated, resulting in a decrease in actual operating voltage. Herein, a bifunctional carbon network composed of an N-doped carbon layer and carbon bridge is constructed around NVPF particles. Through pyrolysis of polydopamine (PDA), the NVPF particles are covered in situ by an N-doped carbon layer, and the carbon bridge generated by polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is also coated with N-doped carbon. Besides, PTFE also serves as a fluorine supplement to ensure that pure NVPF is obtained. As a result, the bifunctional N-doped carbon network-modified NVPF delivers a high reversible capacity (125.7 mA h g-1 at 0.2 C) and appreciable cycle stability (92.7% at 1 C over 300 cycles, and 89.8% at 10 C over 1500 cycles). When assembled into a full cell with a commercial hard carbon anode, it displays a discharge median voltage of up to 3.62 V at 0.2 C. Furthermore, it achieves a high energy density of 373.7 W h kg-1 at a power density of 461.2 W kg-1, with an excellent specific energy retention of 78.2% after 200 cycles. Therefore, this modification method is expected to be extended to other fluorine-containing materials with poor electrical conductivity.",

Herein, NiS1.03 porous hollow spheres (NiS1.03 PHSs) and porous NiS1.03 hollow cages (NiS1.03 PHCs) with high yield are designed and selectively fabricated via a simple solvothermal and subsequent annealing approach.

In addition, the analyses results of in situ and ex situ XRD patterns and HRTEM images reveal the reversible Na-ion conversion mechanism of NiS1.03.

        "abstract": "Sodium titanate Na2Ti3O7 (NTO) has superior electrochemical properties as an anode material in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), and Nb or V doping is suggested to enhance the electrode performance. In this work, we carry out systematic first-principles calculations of the structural, electronic and electrochemical properties of NTO and Na2Ti2.75M0.25O7 (M = Nb, V), using supercells to reveal the effect of Nb or V NTO-doping on its anode performance. It is found that Nb doping gives rise to the expansion of cell volume but V doping induces the shrinkage of cell volume due to the larger and smaller ionic radius of the Nb and V ions, respectively, compared to that of the Ti ion. We perform structural optimization of the intermediate phases of Na2+xM3O7 with increasing Na content x from 0 to 2, revealing that the overall relative volume expansion rate is slightly increased by Nb and V doping but remains lower than 3%. Our calculations demonstrate that the electrode potential of NTO is slightly raised and the specific capacity is reduced, but the electronic and ionic conductivities are improved by Nb or V doping. With the revealed understanding and mechanisms, our work will contribute to the search for advanced electrode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have gradually become one of the most promising energy storage techniques in the current era of post-lithium-ion batteries. For anodes, transitional metal selenides (TMSe) based materials are welcomed choices , owing to relatively higher specific capacities and enriched redox active sites. Nevertheless, current bottlenecks are blamed for their poor intrinsic electronic conductivities, and uncontrollable volume expansion during redox reactions. Given that, an interfacial-confined isochronous conversion strategy is proposed, to prepare orthorhombic/cubic biphasic TMSe heterostructure, namely CuSe/Cu3 VSe4 , through using MXene as the precursor, followed by Cu/Se dual anchorage. As-designed biphasic TMSe heterostructure endows unique hierarchical structure, which contains adequate insertion sites and diffusion spacing for Na ions, besides, the surficial pseudocapacitive storage behaviors can be also proceeded like 2D MXene. By further investigation on electronic structure, the theoretical calculations indicate that biphasic CuSe/Cu3 VSe4 anode exhibits well-enhanced properties, with smaller bandgap and thus greatly improves intrinsic poor conductivities. In addition, the dual redox centers can enhance the electrochemical Na ions storage abilities. As a result, the as-designed biphasic TMSe anode can deliver a reversible specific capacity of 576.8 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 , favorable Na affinity, and reduced diffusion barriers. This work discloses a synchronous solution toward demerits in conductivities and lifespan, which is inspiring for TMSe-based anode development in SIBs systems.",

The fluorinated carboxylate anode, disodium 2, 5-difluoroterephthalate (DFTP-Na), outperforms the other carboxylate anodes with H, Cl, and Br, in terms of high specific capacity (212 mA h g-1), long cycle life (300 cycles), and high rate capability (up to 5 A g-1). As evidenced by the experimental and computational results, the two F atoms in DFTP reduce the solubility, enhance the cyclic stability, and interact with Na+ during the redox reaction, resulting in a high-capacity and stable organic anode material in NIBs. Therefore, this work proves that fluorinating carboxylate compounds is an effective approach to developing high-performance organic anodes for stable and sustainable NIBs.",

        "abstract": "While cost‐effective sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) with crystalline silicon anodes promise high theoretical capacities, they perform poorly because silicon stores sodium ineffectively (capacity <40 mAh g−1). To address this issue, herein an atomic‐order structural‐design tactic is adopted for obtaining unique multilevel gradient‐ordered silicon (MGO‐Si) by simple electrochemical reconstruction. In situ‐formed short‐range‐, medium‐range‐, and long‐range‐ordered structures construct a stable MGO‐Si, which contributes to favorable Na–Si interaction and fast ion diffusion channels. These characteristics afford a high reversible capacity (352.7 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1) and stable cycling performance (95.2% capacity retention after 4000 cycles), exhibiting record values among those reported for pure silicon electrodes. Sodium storage of MGO‐Si involves an adsorption–intercalation mechanism, and a stepwise construction strategy of gradient‐ordered structure further improves the specific capacity (339.5 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1). Reconstructed Si/C composites show a high reversible capacity of 449.5 mAh g−1, significantly better than most carbonaceous anodes. The universality of this design principle is demonstrated for other inert or low‐capacity materials (micro‐Si, SiO2, SiC, graphite, and TiO2), boosting their capacities by 1.5–6 times that of pristine materials, thereby providing new solutions to facilitate sodium storage capability for better‐performing battery designs.",

        "abstract": "Bimetallic composites exhibit great potential as anode materials in advanced energy storage systems owing to their inherent tunability, cost‐effectiveness, and simultaneous achievement of high specific capacity and low reaction potential. However, simple biphase mixing often fails to achieve satisfactory performance. Herein, an innovative stress self‐adaptive bimetallic stellar nanosphere (50–200 nm) wherein bismuth (Bi) is fabricated, as a core, is seamlessly encapsulated by a tin (Sn) sneath (Sn‐Bi@C). This well‐integrated stellar configuration with bimetallic nature embodies the synergy between Bi and Sn, offering fortified conductivity and heightened sodium ion diffusion kinetics. Moreover, through meticulous utilization of finite element analysis simulations, a homogeneous stress distribution within the Sn‐enveloped Bi, efficiently mitigating the structural strain raised from the insertion of Na+ ions, is uncovered. The corresponding electrode demonstrates remarkable cyclic stability, as it exhibits no capacity decay after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1. Furthermore, it achieves an impressive 86.9% capacity retention even after an extensive 2000 cycles. When employed in a Na3V2(PO4)3 ‖ Sn‐Bi@C full cell configuration, it demonstrates exceptional capacity retention of 97.06% after 300 cycles at 1 A g−1, along with a high energy density of 251.2 W h kg−1.",

However, its practical electrochemical performance is hindered by its inherently low electronic conductivity. To address this limitation, researchers have turned to elemental doping as an effective strategy to enhance the conductivity of NTO electrodes. Interestingly, the process of purifying titanium for NTO synthesis often yields Al and Ca impurities, which can be harnessed as cost-effective dopants. In this study, we employ first-principles calculations to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the structural, electronic, and sodium ion diffusion properties of NTO when doped with Al and Ca, either individually or in combination. Doping system structure has good stability. Our findings reveal that both Al or Ca single-doping Our findings reveal that all the Al and Ca single-doping, and AlCa co-doping transform NTO from semiconducting into metallicity. Notably, the sodium ion migration barriers for Ca single-doping greatly decrease (0.13 eV) compared with that of pristine NTO (0.23 eV), indicating fast ion transport. The insights gained from our research hold promise for the development of cost-effective multi-component anode materials for SIBs.",

        "title": "Synergetic Strategy for the Fabrication of Self-Standing Distorted Carbon Nanofibers with Heteroatom Doping for Sodium-Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "Currently, the limited availability of lithium sources is escalating the cost of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Considering the fluctuating economics of LIBs, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have now drawn attention because sodium is an earth-abundant, low-cost element that exhibits similar chemistry to that of LIBs. Despite developments in different anode materials, there still remain several challenges in SIBs, including lighter cell design for SIBs. The presented work designs a facile strategy to prepare nitrogen-doped free-standing pseudo-graphitic nanofibers via electrospinning. A structural and morphological study implies highly disordered graphitic structured nanofibers having diameters of ∼120–170 nm, with a smooth surface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed that nitrogen was successfully doped in carbon nanofibers (CNFs). When served as an anode material for SIBs, the resultant material exhibits excellent sodium-ion storage properties in terms of long-term cycling stability and high rate capability. Notably, a binder-free self-standing CNF without a current collector was used as an anode for SIBs that delivered capacities of 210 and 87 mA h g–1 at 20 and 1600 mA g–1, respectively, retaining a capacity of 177 mA h g–1 when retained at 20 mA g–1. The as-synthesized CNFs demonstrate a long cycle life with a relatively high Columbic efficiency of 98.6% for the 900th cycle, with a stable and excellent rate capacity. The sodium storage mechanisms of the CNFs were examined with various nitrogen concentrations and carbonization temperatures. Furthermore, the diffusion coefficients of the sodium ions based on the electrochemical impedance spectra measurement have been calculated in the range of 10–15–10–12 cm2 s–1, revealing excellent diffusion mobility for Na atoms in the CNFs. This study demonstrates that optimum nitrogen doping and carbonization temperature demonstrated a lower Warburg coefficient and a higher Na-ion diffusion coefficient leads to enhanced stable electrochemical performance. Thus, our study shows that the nitrogen-doped CNFs will have potential for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Electrochemical performance of the layered compound CrPS4 for the usage as anode material in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) was examined and exceptional reversible long-term capacity and capacity retention were found. After 300 cycles, an extraordinary reversible capacity of 687 mAh g-1 at a current rate of 1 A g-1 was achieved, while rate capability tests showed an excellent capacity retention of 100%. Detailed evaluation of the data evidence a change of the electrochemical reaction upon cycling leading to the striking long-term performance. Further investigations targeted the reaction mechanism of the first cycle by applying complementary techniques, i.e., powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), pair distribution function (PDF) analysis, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and 23Na/31P magic-angle-spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The results indicated an unexpectedly complex reaction pathway including formation of several intercalation compounds, depending on the amount of Na inserted at the early discharge states and subsequent conversion to Na2S and strongly disordered metallic Cr at the completely discharged state. While XAS measurements suggest no further presence of intermediates after formation of Na intercalation compounds, several different phases are detected via MAS NMR upon continued discharging. Especially the data obtained from the MAS NMR investigations therefore point toward a very complex reaction pathway. Furthermore, solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation, resulting in the presence of NaF, was observed. After recharging the anode material, no structural long-range order occurred, but short-range order indeed resembled the local environment of the starting material, to a certain extent.",

        "abstract": "MnFe2O4 nanodots (∼3.3 nm) homogeneously dispersed in porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (denoted as MFO@C) were prepared by a feasible electrospinning technique. Meanwhile, MFO@C with the character of flexible free-standing membrane was directly used as binder- and current collector-free anode for sodium-ion batteries, exhibiting high electrochemical performance with high-rate capability (305 mA h g(-1) at 10000 mA g(-1) in comparison of 504 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1)) and ultralong cycling life (ca. 90% capacity retention after 4200 cycles). The Na-storage mechanism was systematically studied, revealing that MnFe2O4 is converted into metallic Mn and Fe after the first discharge (MnFe2O4 + 8Na(+) + 8e(-) → Mn + 2Fe + 4Na2O) and then to MnO and Fe2O3 during the following charge (Mn + 2Fe + 4Na2O → MnO + Fe2O3 + 8Na(+) + 8e(-)). The subsequent cycles occur through reversible redox reactions of MnO + Fe2O3 + 8Na(+) + 8e(-) ↔ Mn + 2Fe + 4Na2O, of which the reduction/oxidation of MnO/Mn takes place at a lower potential than that of Fe2O3/Fe. Furthermore, a soft package sodium-ion full battery with MFO@C anode and Na3V2(PO4)2F3/C cathode was assembled, delivering a stable capacity of ∼400 mA h g(-1) for MFO@C (with 100 cycles at 500 mA g(-1)) and a promising energy density of 77.8 Wh kg(-1) for the whole battery. This is owing to the distinctive structure of very-fine MnFe2O4 nanodots embedded in porous N-doped carbon nanofibers, which effectively improves the utilization rate of active materials, facilitates the transportation of electrons and Na(+) ions, and prevents the particle pulverization/agglomeration upon prolonged cycling.",

The analysis of the composition, structure, and microstructure of the samples reveals the presence of a major hematite phase, which is accompanied by a certain concentration of an oxyhydroxide phase, which can act as a “lithium-reservoir”. By using sodium alginate as a binder, the synthesized anodes display superior electrochemical response, i.e., high specific capacity values and high stability, not only versus Li but also versus a high voltage cathode in a full cell. From these bare materials, clay-supported anodes are further obtained using sepiolite and bentonite natural silicates. The electrochemical performance of such composites is improved, especially for the sepiolite-containing one treated at 400 °C. The thermal treatment at this temperature provides the optimal conditions for a synergic nano-architecture to develop between the clay and the hematite nanoparticles. High capacity values of ~2500 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles at 1 A g−1 and retentions close to 92% are obtained. Moreover, after 450 cycles at 2 A g−1 current rate, this composite electrode displays values as high as ~700 mA h g−1. These results are interpreted taking into account the interactions between the iron oxide nanoparticles and the sepiolite surface through hydrogen bonds. The electrochemical performance is not only dependent on the oxidation state and particle morphology, but the composition is revealed as a key feature.",

Tip‐enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) under an inert gas atmosphere is employed to study the chemical components of the anode/cathode electrolyte interface in a sodium‐ion battery. After the first cycle, TERS reveals that the EEI mostly consists of organic carbonate/dicarbonate, oligoethylene oxides, α,β‐unsaturated vinyl ketones/acetates, and inorganic species ClO4−, ClO3−, and Na2CO3. Whereas after 5× cycling, the EEI composition has evolved to contain long chain monodentate or bridging/bidentate carboxylates and alkoxides. The TERS map reveals the nano‐scale heterogeneity present in the EEI layers and elucidates a multilayered nano‐mosaic coating structure.

Typically, the initial discharge and charge capacities of sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles are 475 and 380 mA h g(-1), respectively, at a current density of 20 mA g(-1). The sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles exhibit high capacity with a reversible discharge capacity of about 190 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles. It should be emphasized that the discharge reaction consists of two steps which correspond to voltage plateaus of 0.93 V and 0.85 V vs. Na(+)/Na in the first discharge curve of the Na/MoS2 battery, respectively. But there is only one apparent voltage plateau in the Na/Na-Mo-S battery, and it reduces to below 0.5 V vs. Na(+)/Na, which can enhance the power density.

        "abstract": "Developing flexible power sources is crucially important to fulfill the need for wearable electronic devices, but state-of-the-art flexible electrodes cannot meet the requirements of practical applications because of their heavy weight and unsatisfactory mechanical properties. Here, we highlight a design strategy for constructing a novel robust three-dimensional (3D) flexible electrode with a unique sandwichlike N-doped carbon sponge/TiO2-δ/reduced graphene oxide (NCS/TiO2-δ/RGO) configuration. In this electrode architecture, ultrafine defect-rich TiO2-δ nanocrystals are spatially sandwiched by a 3D conformal carbon hybrid matrix, where the 3D porous NCS provides an interconnected open diffusion channel for efficient ionic accessibility while the conformal RGO coating layer serves as an additional upper current collector, resulting in a double continuous conductive network for fast electronic transport and guaranteeing excellent electrochemical reaction kinetics. Hence, the as-built NCS/TiO2-δ/RGO flexible electrodes exhibit high-rate capabilities and long-cycling life in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), and they also exhibit outstanding thermal stability under cycling at 55 °C. More remarkably, a flexible soft-package full battery based on a NCS/TiO2-δ/RGO anode and a LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (for LIBs) or Na0.67Fe0.3Mn0.3Co0.4O2 (for SIBs) cathode shows stable electrochemical characteristics under bending and folding, holding great potential for flexible energy storage devices.",

It is revealed that the in-situ-constructed oxygen bonds play a significant role on enhancing Na-storage properties, especially the ultrafast charge/discharge capability. The oxygen-bond-enhanced Sb-O-G composite can deliver a high capacity of 220 mAh/g at an ultrahigh current density of 12 A/g, which is obviously superior to the similar Sb/G composite (130 mAh/g at 10 A/g) just without Sb-O-C bonds. It also exhibits the highest Na-storage capacity compared to Sb/G and pure Sb nanoparticles as well as the best cycling performance. More importantly, this Sb-O-G anode achieves ultrafast (120 C) energy storage in SIB full cells, which have already been shown to power a 26-bulb array and calculator.

        "abstract": "To design a high-performance sodium-ion battery (SIB) anode, binary zinc phosphides (ZnP2 and Zn3P2) were synthesized by a facile solid-state heat treatment process, and their Na storage characteristics were evaluated. The Na reactivity of ZnP2 was better than that of Zn3P2. Therefore, a C-modified ZnP2-based composite (ZnP2-C) was fabricated to achieve better electrochemical performance. To investigate the electrochemical reaction mechanism of ZnP2-C during sodiation/desodiaiton, various ex-situ analytical techniques were employed. During sodiation, ZnP2 in the composite was transformed into NaZn13 and Na3P phases, exhibiting a one-step conversion reaction. Conversely, Zn and P in the NaZn13 and the Na3P, respectively, were fully recombined to the original ZnP2 phase during desodiation. Owing to the one-step conversion/recombination of ZnP2 in the composite during cycling, ZnP2-C showed high electrochemical performance with a highly reversible capacity of 883 mAh g-1 after 130 cycles with no capacity deterioration and a fast C-rate capability of 500 mAh g-1 at 1C and 350 mAh g-1 at 3C.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) have drawn remarkable attention due to their low cost and the practically inexhaustible sodium sources. The major obstacle for the practical application of SIBs is the absence of suitable negative electrode materials with long cycling stability and high rate performance. Here, sulfur‐doped double‐shell sodium titanate (Na2Ti3O7) microspheres constructed from 2D ultrathin nanosheets are synthesized via a templating route combined with a low‐temperature sulfurization process. The resulting double‐shell microspheres deliver a high specific capacity (≈222 mAh g−1 at 1 C), excellent cycling stability (162 mAh g−1 after 15 000 cycles at 20 C), and superior rate capability (122 mAh g−1 at 50 C) as anode for SIBs. The improved electrochemical properties originate from synergistic effects between the unique double‐shell nanostructures built from 2D nanosheets architecture and sulfur doping. This synergistic effect not only stabilize Na2Ti3O7‐based electrode during the cycling, but also improve the sluggish Na insertion/extraction kinetics by narrowing the bandgap of Na2Ti3O7. The synthesis strategy proposed here can be developed into a technical rationale for generating high‐performance sodium‐storage devices.",

        "abstract": "Carbonaceous materials are considered strong candidates as anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), which are expected to play an indispensable role in the carbon‐neutral era. Herein, novel braided porous carbon fibres (BPCFs) are prepared using the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method. The BPCFs possess interwoven porous structures and abundant vacancies. The growth mechanism of the BPCFs can be attributed to the polycrystalline transformation of the nanoporous copper catalyst in the early stage of CVD process. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the Na+ adsorption energies of the mono‐vacancy edges of the BPCFs (−1.22 and −1.09 eV) are lower than that of an ideal graphene layer (−0.68 eV), clarifying in detail the adsorption‐dominated sodium storage mechanism. Hence, the BPCFs as an anode material present an outstanding discharge capacity of 401 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 500 cycles. Remarkably, this BPCFs anode, under high‐mass‐loading of 5 mg cm−2, shows excellent long‐term cycling ability with a reversible capacity of 201 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1 over 1000 cycles.

        "abstract": "Metal phosphorus trichalcogenides have been regarded as promising high-capacity anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high reversible capacity. Nevertheless, their practical application is plagued by poor diffusion kinetics and dramatic volume fluctuations during the charge-discharge process, resulting in no satisfactory rate and life span so far. Herein, we propose a space-confinement strategy to remarkably promote the cycling stability and rate capacity by embedding FePS3 particles in the interlayer of expanded graphite (EG), which are derived from in situ transformation of graphite intercalation compounds. The layered EG not only greatly alleviates the volume fluctuations of FePS3 by the space confinement effect so as to maintain the stability of the electrode microstructure, but it also ensures rapid Na+ and electron transfer during cycling. When acting as an anode for SIBs, the hybrid electrode delivers a highly reversible capacity of 312.5 mAh g-1 at an ultrahigh rate of 50 A g-1 while retaining an ultralong life span of 1300 cycles with a retention of 82.4% at 10 A g-1. Moreover, the excellent performance of the assembled full battery indicates the practical application potential of FPS/EG.",

        "abstract": "Optimisation of the annealing time for the fabrication of nitrogen-doped graphitic-spheres (NDGSs), formed from a nitrogen-functionalised aromatic precursor at 800 °C, to give high nitrogen doping has been performed. Thorough analysis of the NDGSs, approximately 3 μm in diameter, pinpointed an optimum annealing time of 6 to 12 hours to obtain highest nitrogen content at the surface of the spheres (reaching a stoichiometry of around C3N at the surface and C9N in the bulk), with the quantity of sp2 and sp3 surface nitrogen varying with annealing time. The results suggest that changes in the nitrogen dopant level occur through slow diffusion of the nitrogen throughout the NDGSs, along with reabsorption of nitrogen-based gases produced during annealing. A stable bulk nitrogen dopant level of 9% was revealed in the spheres. The NDGSs performed well as anodes in lithium-ion batteries, providing a capacity of up to 265 mA h g−1 at a charging rate of C/20, but did not perform well in sodium-ion batteries without the use of diglyme, consistent with the presence of graphitic regions, but with low internal porosity.",

Herein, we decorated multilayer MXene (Ti3C2Tx) with Sb nanoparticles (NPs) via a facile solution-phase method, in which Sb NPs with a diameter of about 5–10 nm are absorbed on the surface of MXene layers by the electrostatic attraction action. The hybrid material Ti3C2Tx@Sb-0.5 delivers a higher reversible capacity of 200 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 than that of pure Ti3C2Tx (90 mA h g−1), and shows a much better capacity retention of nearly 98% after 500 cycles compared with Sb NPs. Also, it achieves superior rate performance (remaining a capacity of 127 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1) and excellent long-term stability (a capacity retention of almost 92.3% after 8000 cycles). These results indicate that Ti3C2Tx@Sb-0.5 possess a potential for high-performance sodium ion batteries anodes.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfides are recognized as an excellent alternative to sodium ion anodes ascribed to the outstanding theoretical capacity. The unique crystal arrangement of VS4 gives it exceptional theoretical capacity, despite challenges like insufficient electrical conductivity and undesirable volume expansion. Herein, a novel stabilized anode featuring a distinctive 3D hollow spherical structure is proposed, providing a simple strategy to synthesize such anodes for VS4-HCMSs bonded via C-O-S and V-O-C interfaces. The kinetic investigations and density functional theory reveal that the unique structure connected by interfacial bonds enhances Na+ transport rate and charge transfer efficiency, while carbon greatly mitigates the volume expansion. Unsurprisingly, the VS4-HCMSs exhibit an impressive first-cycle Coulombic efficiency of 91.31% and an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 612 mAh g-1 after 300 cycles at 0.5 A g-1, even exhibit the reversible capacity of 498.8 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 5 A g-1. Additionally, the NaFePO4//VS4-HCMSs full cell is cycled for 200 cycles at 0.2 C and powered the light-emitting diodes for up to 30 minutes afterward. Overall, this work enhances the conductivity and stability of the material by combining VS4 with hollow carbon mesoporous spheres through interfacial bonding, offering an efficient strategy to anode materials in sodium-ion batteries.",

Herein, an \"embryo\" strategy is proposed for synthesis of nanorod-embedded MoO2 /MoS2 /C network nanoarchitecture as anode for SIBs with high-rate performance. Interestingly, L-cysteine which plays triple roles including sulfur source, reductant, and carbon source can be utilized to produce the sulfur vacancy-enriched heterostructure. Specifically, L-cysteine can combine with metastable monoclinic MoO3 nanorods at room temperature to encapsulate the \"nutrient\" of MoOx analogues (MoO2.5 (OH)0.5 and MoO3 ·0.5H2 O) and hydrogen-deficient L-cysteine in the \"embryo\" precursor affording for subsequent in situ multistep heating treatment.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted tremendous attention as potential low-cost energy storage alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to the intrinsic safety and great abundance of sodium. For developing competitive SIBs, highly efficient anode materials with large capacity and rapid ion diffusion are indispensable. In this study, a two-dimensional (2D) Dirac monolayer, that is, borophosphene, is proposed as a promising anode material for high performance SIBs on the basis of density functional theory calculations. The performances of Na adsorption and diffusion, maximum specific capacity, open circuit voltage, cyclical stability and electronic properties combined with Bader charge analysis are explored. It is found that borophosphene can spontaneously adsorb a Na atom with a binding energy of -0.838 eV. A low diffusion energy barrier of 0.221 eV suggests rapid ion conductivity. More intriguingly, a maximum specific capacity of 1282 mA h g-1 can be achieved in borophosphene, which is one of the largest values reported for 2D anode materials for SIBs. A low average voltage of 0.367 V is estimated, implying a suitable operating voltage of the anode material. The metallic properties, tiny surface expansion, and good kinetic stability of sodiated borophosphene give rise to high electrical conductivity and favorable cyclability. These abovementioned advantages suggest that borophosphene can be used as a Dirac anode material for SIBs with excellent performance including a large specific capacity, high-rate capability, and favorable cyclability.",

What is more essential, such a polymer electrolyte based soft-package monolithic sodium ion cell can still power a red light emitting diode lamp and run finite times without suffering from any internal short-circuit failures, even in the case of a bended and wrinkled state. Considering these aspects, this work no doubt provides a new approach for the design of a high-performance polymer electrolyte toward monolithic sodium ion battery with exceptional rate capability and high safety.",

        "abstract": "Na-ion batteries (NIBs) have attracted great interest as a possible technology for grid-scale energy storage for the past few years owing to the wide distribution, low cost and environmental friendliness of sodium resources and similar chemical mechanisms to those of established Li-ion batteries (LIBs). Nonetheless, the implementation of NIBs is seriously hindered because of their low rate capability and cycling stability. This is mainly because the large ionic size of Na+ can reduce the structural stability and cause sluggish reaction kinetics of electrode materials. Herein, three-dimensional nanoarchitectured coral-like CoSe2@N-doped carbon (CL-CoSe2@NC) was synthesized through solvothermal and selenizing techniques. As a result, CL-CoSe2@NC for NIBs at 2 A g-1 exhibits an ultrahigh specific capacity of 345.4 mA h g-1 after 2800 cycles and a superhigh initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 93.1%. Ex situ XRD, HRTEM, SAED and XPS were executed to study the crystal structure evolution between Na and CoSe2 during sodiation/de-sodiation processes. The aforementioned results indicate that the improved sodium storage property of CL-CoSe2@NC could be attributed to better electrode kinetics and a stable SEI film because of the 3D nanoarchitecture and the existence of the NC layer.",

        "abstract": "Heterojunction, with the advantage of fast charge transfer dynamics, is considered to be an effective strategy to address the low capacity and poor rate capability of anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). As well, carbonaceous materials, as a crucial additive, can effectively ameliorate the ion/electron conductivity of integrated composites, realizing the fast ion transport and charge transfer. Here, motivated by the enhancement effect of carbon and heterojunction on conductivity, it is proposed that the CoSe2 /WSe2 heterojunction as inner core is coated by carbon outer shell and uniformly embedded in porous carbon nanosheets (denoted as CoSe2 /WSe2 @C/CNs), which is used as anode material for SIBs. Combining with density functional theoretical calculations, it is confirmed that the structure of heterojunction can introduce built-in electric-field, which can accelerate the transportation of Na+ and improve the conductivity of electrons. Moreover, the introduction of porous carbon nanosheets (CNs) can provide a channel for the transportation of Na+ and avoid the volume expansion during Na+ insertion and extraction process. As it is expected, CoSe2 /WSe2 @C/CNs anode displays ultrastable specific capacity of 501.9 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 over 200 cycles, and ultrahigh rate capacity of 625 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Zn anode is confronted with serious Zn dendrite growth and water-induced parasitic reactions, which severely hinders the rapid development and practical application of aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs). Herein, inspired by sodium hyaluronate (SH) biomolecules in living organisms featured with the functions of water retention, ion-transport regulation, and film-formation, the SH working as a dynamic and self-adaptive \"mask\" is proposed to stabilize Zn anode. Benefiting from the abundant functional groups with high hydrophilicity and zincophilicity, SH molecule can constrain active water molecules on the Zn-electrolyte interface and participate in Zn2+ solvation structure to suppress parasitic reactions. Furthermore, the dynamical adsorption of SH with high-density negative charge on the Zn surface could serve as Zn2+ reservoirs to guide uniform Zn deposition. Consequently, stable Zn plating and an ultrahigh cumulative plating capacity (CPC) of 4.8 Ah cm-2 are achieved even at 20 mA cm-2 (20 mAh cm-2 ) in a Zn||Zn symmetric battery, reaching a record level in AZMBs. In addition, the Zn||β-MnO2 full battery exhibits a substantially improved cycle stability. This work presents a route to realize a highly reversible and stable Zn metal anode by learning from nature.",

        "abstract": "Graphene-like graphite (GLG) is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries, which is believed to have unique kinetic properties compared to hard carbon due to its different intercalation mechanism. In this study, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to investigate the kinetic properties of sodium-ion intercalation in GLG. Our results indicated that the activation energies for interfacial sodium-ion transfer of GLGs were nearly identical to those reported for graphite, regardless of the heat treatment temperature of the GLGs. Furthermore, these activation energies were lower than those observed for hard carbon, suggesting better sodium-ion intercalation kinetics. In addition, the diffusion coefficient of sodium ions in the GLG was similar to that of graphite, with the highest value observed for GLG800, the GLG heat-treated at the highest temperature of 800 °C. This may indicate that the diffusion coefficient increases with the presence of nanopores in the graphene layer of GLG. It has also been reported that GLG800 is superior in terms of reversible capacity and working potential compared to GLGs synthesized at other temperatures. Consequently, the results clearly demonstrated that GLG800 has the best electrochemical properties in terms of both thermodynamics and kinetics among the GLGs investigated in this study.",

It was also observed that the crosslinked 2D nanosheets can effectively reduce the diffusion lengths of sodium ions and electrons, resulting in an outstanding rate performance (>700 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 and 458 mA h g-1 at even 10 A g-1) and extraordinary cycling stability (698 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 500 cycles).

        "abstract": "Magnesium molybdate (MgMoO4), which possesses synergistic features combining both hierarchical plate-like nanomaterials and porous architectures, has been successfully synthesized through a facile combustion synthesis at a low temperature. The hierarchical architecture is characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. The as-obtained MgMoO4 nanoplates showed a porous structure with a pore-size distribution ranging from 50 to 70 nm. This porosity provides an electron transport pathway and enhanced surface reaction kinetics. The binding energies measured for Mg 2p, Mo 3d, 3p and O 1s are consistent with the literature, and with the metal ions being present as M(ii) and M(vi) states, respectively. This indicates that the oxidation states of the metal cations are as expected. The electrochemical behaviour of MgMoO4 was investigated using aqueous (NaOH) and non-aqueous solvents (NaClO4 in EC : DMC : FEC) for supercapacitor and battery applications. The sodium-ion capacitor involves ion absorption and insertion into the MgMoO4 electrodes resulting in superior power and energy densities. However, the cycling stability was found to be stable only for an aqueous system. The formation of a solid electrolyte surface layer restricted the reversible capacity of the MgMoO4 in the sodium-battery. Nevertheless, it does offer some promise as an anode material for storing energy with high rate performance and excellent capacity retention. Detailed comparative analyses of various electrolytes in storage devices such as hybrid sodium-ion capacitors and sodium-ion batteries are vital for the integration of hierarchical structured materials into practical applications.

        "abstract": "Conversion electrodes, which can realize high capacities by employing the wider valence states of transition metals, are investigated for sodium storage and applied for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Importantly, this work is a first report for the sodium storage ability and related storage mechanism in oxalate compounds, specifically cobalt oxalate (CoC2O4) nanorods. The nanorods are intimately blended with acetylene black powders to achieve sufficient electrical conductivity (∼10-3 S cm-1). The resulting C-CoC2O4 electrode delivers an initial capacity of about 330 mA h (g-CoC2O4)-1 at a rate of 0.2 C (60 mA g-1) and preserves 75% of the initial capacity over 200 cycles. A high charge (oxidation) capacity, ∼111 mA h g-1, was achieved even at 30 C (9000 mA g-1). This remarkable electrode performance is reported for the first time for metal oxalate compounds tested for Na cells, to the best of our knowledge. X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy analyses lead to the proposal of a new sodium storage mechanism. For this mechanism, CoC2O4 is converted into Co metal involving with the creation of Na2C2O4 on discharge (reduction), and the Co metal is recovered to CoC2O4 on charge. The employed electroconducting carbon is likely to provide good electron conduction paths, which enables fast conversion on both discharge and charge. A full cell comprised of the C-CoC2O4 anode and carbon-coated NaCrO2 cathode exhibits good retention capacity over prolonged cycling, with retention of about 84.7% of the first capacity [107 mA h (g-NaCrO2)-1] for 300 cycles, and is active at a rate of 5 C (550 mA g-1), with a capacity of 79.5 mA h g-1.

Herein, a functional electrolyte containing 1.0 m NaCF3 SO3 in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME) (1.0 m NaCF3 SO3 -DEGDME) is developed, which can be readily used for NiCo2 S4 anode with high initial coulomb efficiency (96.2%), enhanced cycling performance, and boosted capacities (341.7 mA h g-1 after 250 continuous cycles at the current density of 200 mA g-1 ). The electrochemical tests and related phase characterization combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicate the ether-based electrolyte is more suitable for the NiCo2 S4 anode in SIBs due to the formation of a stable electrode-electrolyte interface. Additionally, the importance of the voltage window is also demonstrated to further optimize the electrochemical performance of the NiCo2 S4 electrode. The formation of sulfide intermediates during charging and discharging is predicted by combining DFT and verified by in situ XRD and HRTEM. The findings indicate that electrolyte engineering would be an effective way of performance enhancement for sulfides in practical SIBs.",

In this work, a facile and low-cost surface solvation treatment is developed to synthesize Fe2 VO4 hierarchical porous microparticles, which efficiently prevents the aggregation of the Fe2 VO4 primary nanoparticles. The reaction between alcohol molecules and surface hydroxy groups is confirmed by density functional theory calculations and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The electrochemical mechanism of Fe2 VO4 as lithium-ion battery anode is characterized by in situ X-ray diffraction for the first time. This electrode material is capable of delivering a high reversible discharge capacity of 799 mA h g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 with a high initial coulombic efficiency of 79%, and the capacity retention is 78% after 500 cycles. Moreover, a remarkable reversible discharge capacity of 679 mA h g-1 is achieved at 5 A g-1 . Furthermore, when tested as sodium-ion battery anode, a high reversible capacity of 382 mA h g-1 can be delivered at the current density of 1 A g-1 , which still retains at 229 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles.

        "abstract": "In order to improve the electrochemical kinetics of anatase titania (TiO2), Mn-doped TiO2 incorporated with functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) has been prepared by a modified hydrothermal method and tested for both lithium (LIB) and sodium-ion battery (SIB) anodes. The size of the TiO2 particles is controlled to ∼35-40 nm, with almost even distribution on the MWCNTs surface. The nanostructuring and appropriate doping of cost-effective manganese into the TiO2 host improved the electrochemical performance in terms of high rate capability and specific capacity for both the rechargeable battery systems. For the LIBs, the charge capacity of the 5% Mn-TiO2/MWCNT anode is 226.3 mA h g-1 in the first cycle, and is retained at 176.4 mA h g-1 after 80 cycles as compared with the SIBs, in which the charge capacity is 152.1 mA h g-1 in the first cycle, and is retained at 121.4 mA h g-1 after 80 cycles. After testing the electrodes at a high current rate of 20C, the nanocomposite electrode can still demonstrate charge capacities of 131.2 and 117.2 mA h g-1 at a 0.1C rate for LIBs and SIBs, respectively. The incorporation of Mn-ions (2+, 4+) is found to play a crucial role in terms of defects and vacancy creation, increasing conduction band electrons and lattice expansion to facilitate alkali metal ion diffusion for superior electrochemical performance. The combination of heteroatom doping and use of a highly conductive additive in the form of MWCNTs has resulted in excellent electrode integrity, high ion accessibility, and fast electron transport. Its outstanding cycling stability and remarkable rate performance make the 5% Mn-TiO2/MWCNT a promising anode material for high-performance LIBs and SIBs.",

Increasing the upper cut‐off voltage is an intriguing approach to achieve even higher energy density in lithium ion batteries. However, poor oxidation stability of the state‐of‐the‐art electrolytes leads to transition metal dissolution (TMD), migration, and deposition (TMDMD) on the negative electrode, followed by sudden and rapid capacity fade. Furthermore, the chemical instability of the lithium hexafluorophosphate causes hydro‐fluoric acid to develop, which targets the native SiOx layers on silicon anodes and breaks the chemical bond to the carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt binder. Herein, a fluorine‐rich electrolyte formulation consisting of lithium‐bis(fluorsulfonyl)imide with fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC): bis(2,2,2,) trifluoroethyl carbonate (BFEC) was applied in NMC811||10%SiOx‐90%graphite cells to achieve high oxidation stability and prevent TMD and deposition.

        "title": "(Best Student Presentation) Uncovering the Electrochemical Sodium-Solvent Co-Intercalation Reaction with Graphite",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is on the verge of commercialisation, with several companies announcing large scale production during 2023. SIBs have many similarities with lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), and offers comparable cycle life, as well as specific energies and power as LIBs while often being made with more abundant materials.[1] There is, however, a clear difference between LIBs and SIBs when it comes to the ions interaction with graphite – the standard anode in LIBs. Sodium-ions are unable to form thermodynamically stable structures inside graphite with high specific capacities,[2] often showing less than 20 mAh/g. But, in 2014 it was shown that when a diglyme (G2) based electrolyte was used suddenly 110 mAh/g of sodium-ion could be stored inside graphite through a solvent co-intercalation mechanism, i.e., solvated sodium-ions can be stored in much larger quantities in graphite than bare ions.[3] Surprisingly, even if the reaction is accompanied by a large expansion of the graphite to accommodate the solvated ions, the reaction is highly reversible and very fast, with thousands of cycles having been reported and current densities of several A/g seem to have no large impact on the storage capability.[4] The system is also able to operate at low temperatures, and shows a great deal of tunability through small changes in the electrolyte composition.[5-7] These properties opens up for applications in grid energy storage, as the system is able to deliver a moderate amount of energy, but at high power over a wide temperature range and over many cycles, while also being made by cheap and available resources.\n Even if several articles have been published on the subject, many fundamental questions about the reaction remain debated, such as the existence of and possible properties of an SEI that allows solvated ions through, or the stoichiometry of the reaction itself. It is often argued that either the entire solvation shell, consisting of 2 G2 molecules, is intercalated along with Na+, or partial desolvation occurs and only a part of the solvation shell enters the graphite, Figure 1. Yet, there is very little evidence for either case. Here, we report on two independent methods, one relying on ex-situ analysis of the graphite weight at different potentials and one on in-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, that shows that the reaction when using a G2 or monoglyme (G1) based electrolyte is far more complicated than previously thought and changes drastically during the sodiation process. We show that at high voltages the system is opened up by solvated ions and is subsequently flooded with solvent molecules, and these flooding events occur again during parts of the sodiation process. After the system has successfully formed a stage I compound the system enters a non-faradaic process where the free glyme molecules inside the graphite is preferentially replaced by solvated ions until the graphite reach its full storage capacity of solvated ions.\n The mass measurements and impedance measurements are supplemented with ab initio molecular dynamics of the electrolytes, and density functional theory simulations of solvated ions inside of graphite. The proposed electrochemical process is also compared with and corroborated by material characterisation techniques, such as electrochemical dilatometry and operando X-ray techniques, as well as NMR measurements.\n \n References:\n \n [1] P.

        "abstract": "\n Tin oxide (SnO2) is a useful anode material due to its high capacity (1493 and 1378 mAh g-1 vs Li/Li+ and vs Na/Na+, respectively) and natural abundance (tin is one of the 30 most abundant elements on earth). Unfortunately, only moderate electrical conductivity and significant volume expansion of up to 300% for Li-ion, and as much as 520% for Na-ion can occur. Here, we use an ordered macroporous interconnected inverse opal (IO) architectures to enhance rate capability, structural integrity, and gravimetric capacity, without conductive additives and binders. Excellent capacity retention is shown during cycling vs Na/Na+ relative to Li/Li+. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis, galvanostatic cycling, and differential capacity analysis extracted from rate performance testing evidence the irreversibility of the oxidation of metallic Sn to SnO2 during charge. This behavior allows for a very stable electrode during cycling at various rates. A stable voltage profile and rate performance is demonstrated for both systems. In a Na-ion half cell, the SnO2 retained >76% capacity after 100 cycles, and a similar retention after rate testing.",

        "abstract": "A tin-decorated reduced graphene oxide, originally developed for lithium-ion batteries, has been investigated as an anode in sodium-ion batteries. The composite has been synthetized through microwave reduction of poly acrylic acid functionalized graphene oxide and a tin oxide organic precursor. The final product morphology reveals a composite in which Sn and SnO2 nanoparticles are homogenously distributed into the reduced graphene oxide matrix. The XRD confirms the initial simultaneous presence of Sn and SnO2 particles. SnRGO electrodes, prepared using Super-P carbon as conducting additive and Pattex PL50 as aqueous binder, were investigated in a sodium metal cell. The Sn-RGO showed a high irreversible first cycle capacity: only 52% of the first cycle discharge capacity was recovered in the following charge cycle. After three cycles, a stable SEI layer was developed and the cell began to work reversibly: the practical reversible capability of the material was 170 mA·h·g−1. Subsequently, a material of formula NaLi0.2Ni0.25Mn0.75Oδ was synthesized by solid-state chemistry. It was found that the cathode showed a high degree of crystallization with hexagonal P2-structure, space group P63/mmc. The material was electrochemically characterized in sodium cell: the discharge-specific capacity increased with cycling, reaching at the end of the fifth cycle a capacity of 82 mA·h·g−1. After testing as a secondary cathode in a sodium metal cell, NaLi0.2Ni0.25Mn0.75Oδ was coupled with SnRGO anode to form a sodium-ion cell. The electrochemical characterization allowed confirmation that the battery was able to reversibly cycle sodium ions. The cell’s power response was evaluated by discharging the SIB at different rates. At the lower discharge rate, the anode capacity approached the rated value (170 mA·h·g−1). By increasing the discharge current, the capacity decreased but the decline was not so pronounced: the anode discharged about 80% of the rated capacity at 1 C rate and more than 50% at 5 C rate.",

However, low energy densities (˂ 100 Wh kg-1) due to the lack of high capacity (˃ 150 mAh g-1) anodes capable of fast-charging are delaying their practical implementation. Herein, we report a high-performance Na-ion hybrid capacitor based on interface engineered hierarchical TiO2 nanosheet anode consisting of bronze (~ 15%) and anatase (~ 85%) crystallites (~ 10 nm). This pseudocapacitive dual-phase anode demonstrated exceptional specific capacity of 289 mAh g-1@ 0.025 A g-1, and excellent rate capability (110 mAh g-1@ 1.0 A g-1). Na-ion hybrid capacitor integrating dual-phase hierarchical TiO2 nanosheet anode and activated carbon cathode exhibited a high energy density of 200 Wh kg-1 (based on the total mass of active materials in both electrodes) and power density of 6191 W kg-1. These values are in the energy and power density range of Li-ion batteries (100-300 Wh kg-1) and supercapacitors (5000-15000 W kg-1) respectively. Furthermore, exceptional capacity retention of 80% is observed after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. Outstanding electrochemical performance of the demonstrated Na-ion hybrid capacitor is credited to the enhanced pseudocapacitive Na-ion intercalation of two-dimensional TiO2 anode resulting from nanointerfaces between bronze and anatase crystallites. Mechanistic investigations evidenced Na-ion storage through intercalation pseudocapacitance with minimal structural changes. This approach of nanointerfaces induced pseudocapacitance presents great opportunities towards developing advanced electrode materials for next-generation Na-ion hybrid capacitors.",

        "abstract": "Anatase TiO2 is a promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high specific capacity, low cost, and excellent cycle stability. However, low electrical conductivity and poor Na+ ion transport in TiO2 limit its practical applications. Here, substantially boosted Na+ ion transport and charge transfer kinetics are demonstrated by constructing a near-ideal non-rectifying titanium carbonitride/nitrogen-doped TiO2 (TiCx N1- x /N-TiO2 ) heterostructure. Owing to the fast plasma effects and metastable hybrid phases, the TiCx N1- x is epitaxially grown on TiO2 . Energy band engineering at the interface induces high electron densities and a strong built-in electric field, which lowers the Na+ diffusion barrier by a factor of 1.7. As a result, the TiCx N1- x /N-TiO2 electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. The reversible specific capacities at rates of 0.1 and 10 C reach 312.3 and 173.7 mAh g-1 , respectively. After 600 cycles of charge and discharge at 10 C, the capacity retention rate is 98.7%. This work discovers an effective non-equilibrium plasma-enabled process to construct heterointerfaces that can enhance Na+ ion transport and provides generic guidelines for the design of heterostructures for a broader range of energy storage, separation, and other devices that rely on controlled ionic transport.",

To enable improved storage, a rational active material and electrode design is proposed. Accordingly, the following features were simultaneously incorporated into the design: (i) an optimal particle size, (ii) a conducting matrix, (iii) adequately large active material surface area and (iv) strong electrode material-current collector integrity. Electrodes incorporating this rational design exhibit excellent high rate performance and impressive cyclability during lithium storage. For instance, Fe(3)O(4) electrodes deliver a charge capacity of 950 mAh g(-1) at 1.2 C (~2.6 times higher than graphite and 5.4 times higher than Li(4)Ti(5)O(12)). Further, these electrodes show no signs of capacity fade even up to 1100 cycles. Impressively, the cells could also be charged-discharged to 65% of their theoretical capacity in just 5 min or 12 C (11.11 A g(-1)). The rate performance and cyclability of lithium storage achieved here are amongst the highest reported values in the literature for the conversion reaction in Fe(3)O(4). Besides lithium storage, the dual role of this anode is shown by demonstrating its sodium storage ability by conversion reaction for the first time.",

        "abstract": "Exploiting high‐performance yet low‐cost hard carbon anodes is crucial to advancing the state‐of‐the‐art sodium‐ion batteries. However, the achievement of superior initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and high Na‐storage capacity via low‐temperature carbonization remains challenging due to the presence of tremendous defects with few closed pores. Here, a facile hybrid carbon framework design is proposed from the polystyrene precursor bearing distinct molecular bridges at a low pyrolysis temperature of 800°C via in situ fusion and embedding strategy. This is realized by integrating triazine‐ and carbonyl‐crosslinked polystyrene nanospheres during carbonization. The triazine crosslinking allows in situ fusion of spheres into layered carbon with low defects and abundant closed pores, which serves as a matrix for embedding the well‐retained carbon spheres with nanopores/defects derived from carbonyl crosslinking. Therefore, the hybrid hard carbon with intimate interface showcases synergistic Na ions storage behavior, showing an ICE of 70.2%, a high capacity of 279.3 mAh g−1, and long‐term 500 cycles, superior to carbons from the respective precursor and other reported carbons fabricated under the low carbonization temperature. The present protocol opens new avenues toward low‐cost hard carbon anode materials for high‐performance sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) stands out as the most prospective anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) with significant potential for commercial applications. However, some long-standing and intractable obstacles, like low first coulombic efficiency (ICE), poor rate capability, storage capacity, and cycling stability, have severely hindered the conversion process from laboratory to commercialization. The above-mentioned issues are closely related to Na+ transfer kinetics, surface chemistry, and internal pseudo-graphitic carbon content. Herein, constructing molybdenum-modified hard carbon solid spheres (Mo2C/HC-5.0), both the ion transfer kinetics, surface chemistry, and internal pseudo-graphitic carbon content are comprehensively improved. Specifically, Mo2C/HC-5.0 with higher pseudo-graphitic carbon content provides a large number of active sites and a more stable layer structure, resulting in improved sodium storage capacity, rate performance, and cycling stability. Moreover, the lower defect density and specific surface area of Mo2C/HC-5.0 further enhance ICE and sodium storage capacity. Consequently, the Mo2C/HC-5.0 anode achieves a high capacity of 410.7 mA h g-1 and an ICE of 83.9% at 50 mA g-1. Furthermore, the material exhibits exceptional rate capability and cycling stability, maintaining a capacity of 202.8 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1 and 214.9 mA h g-1 after 800 cycles at 1 A g-1.",

However, it suffers from severe volume expansion during the sodiation-desodiation process. Encapsulating Sb into a carbon matrix can effectively buffer the volume change of Sb. However, the sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics in traditional carbon shells is still a bottleneck for achieving high-rate performance in Sb/C composite materials. Here we design and synthesize a yolk-shell Sb@Void@graphdiyne (GDY) nanobox (Sb@Void@GDY NB) anode for high-rate and long cycle life SIBs. The intrinsic in-plane cavities in GDY shells offer three-dimensional Na+ transporting channels, enabling fast Na+ diffusion through the GDY shells. Electrochemical kinetics analyses show that the Sb@Void@GDY NBs exhibit faster Na+ transport kinetics than traditional Sb@C NBs. In situ transmission electron microscopy analysis reveals that the hollow structure and the void space between Sb and GDY successfully accommodate the volume change of Sb during cycling, and the plastic GDY shell maintains the structural integrity of NBs. Benefiting from the above structural merits, the Sb@Void@GDY NBs exhibit excellent rate capability and extraordinary cycling stability.",

However, the applications of organic electrode materials are still limited because of their dissolution in electrolytes and low electrical conductivity, which in turn cause poor cycling stability. Here, for the first time, we report 2-amino-4-thiazole-acetic acid (ATA) and its sodium salt, sodium 2-amino-4-thiazol-derived polymer (PATANa), as an anode. The PATANa showed a two-dimensional (2D) nanosheet structure, offering a larger contact area with the electrolyte and a shorter ion-migration path, which improved the ion-diffusion kinetics. The polymer showed excellent cycling stability and outstanding rate capability when tested as an anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). It could deliver a high reversible specific capacity of 303 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 for 100 cycles and maintain a high discharge capacity of 190 mA h g-1 after 1000 long cycle numbers even at a high current density of 1000 mA g-1.

The characterization results demonstrate that the hybridization with optimal amount of CN induces local distortion in the crystal structure of the hybrid, which would benefit SIB performance. Systematic electrochemical studies with a half-cell configuration show that the present hybrid structure exhibits a promising reversible specific capacity of 348 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles with good rate capability. Simulation result reveals that the iron atoms in nickel iron sulfide act as a primary active site to accommodate Na+ ions. At last, with a full cell configuration using NFCN and Na3 V2 (PO4 )2 O2 F as the anode and cathode, respectively, the specific capacity appears to be ≈95 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 condition.

        "abstract": "Graphene/metal oxides (G/MO) composite materials have attracted much attention as the anode of sodium ion batteries (SIBs), because of the high theoretical capacity. However, most metal oxides operate based on the conversion mechanism and the alloying mechanism has changed to Na2O after the first cycle. The influence of G/Na2O (G/N) on the subsequent sodiation process has never been clearly elucidated. In this work, we report a systematic investigation on the G/N interface from both aspects of theoretical simulation and experiment characterization. By applied first-principles simulations, we find that the sluggish kinetics in the G/MO materials is mainly caused by the high diffusion barrier (0.51 eV) inside the Na2O bulk, while the G/N interface shows a much faster transport kinetics (0.25 eV) via unique double-interstitialcy mechanism. G/N interface possesses an interfacial storage of Na atom through the charge separation mechanism. The experimental evidence confirms that high interfacial ratio structure of G/N greatly improves the rate performance and endows G/MO materials the interfacial storage. Furthermore, the experimental investigation finds that the high interfacial ratio structure of G/N also benefits from the reversible reaction between SnO2 and Sn during cycling. Lastly, the effects of (N, O, S) doping in graphene systems at the G/N interface were also explored. This work provides a fundamental comprehension on the G/MO interface structure during the sodiation process, which is helpful to design energy storage materials with high rate performance and large capacity.",

Here, Sn-Sb electrodes were synthesized with compositional control by optimizing electrodeposition parameters and stoichiometry in solution and the alloys were cycled in sodium-ion half-cells to investigate the effects of stoichiometry on both performance and electrochemical phenomena. Higher concentrations of antimony deposited into the films were found to best maintain specific capacity over 270 cycles in the tin-antimony alloys, with each cell showing a slow, gradual decrease in capacity. We identified that a 1:3 ratio of Sn:Sb retained a specific capacity of 486 mAh/g after 270 cycles, highlighting a need to explore this material further.

        "abstract": "Metals such as Sb and Bi are important anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries because they feature a large capacity and low reaction potential. However, the accumulation of stress and strain upon sodium storage leads to the formation of cracks and fractures, resulting in electrode failure upon extended cycling. In this work, the design and construction of BixSb1−x bimetallic alloy films with a compositional gradient to mitigate the intrinsic structural instability is reported. In the gradient film, the top is rich in Sb, contributing to the capacity, while the bottom is rich in Bi, helping to reduce the stress in the interphase between the film and the substrate. Significantly, this gradient film affords a high reversible capacity of ≈500 mAh g−1 and sustains 82% of the initial capacity after 1000 cycles at 2 C, drastically outperforming the solid‐solution counterpart and many recently reported alloy anodes. Such a gradient design can open up the possibilities to engineering high‐capacity anode materials that are structurally unstable due to the huge volume variation upon energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion battery is emerging as a promising technology in the post-lithium-ion battery era to meet the high demand for portable energy storage devices. Custom-designed organic materials have been pursued as sustainable alternative electrodes for sodium-ion batteries, offering a solution that bypasses the need for traditional high-temperature synthesis. However, the challenge lies in achieving the desired electrochemical properties through precise structural modulation and the incorporation of redox-active functional groups. In this study, a triptycene-based microporous organic ladder polymer is developed featuring redox-active quinone moieties, designed as an anode material for high-performance sodium-ion batteries. The vertically aligned quinone moieties in the porous ladder polymer prevent the eclipsed stacking of layers, thereby enhancing the exposure of electroactive sites to electrolyte ions. Additionally, the ladder polymer exhibits almost unimodal pores due to its structural rigidity, facilitating fast Na+ ion diffusion. The redox-active quinone moieties host Na+ ions, and the microporosity supports capacitive ion storage. Consequently, a high reversible specific capacity of 316 mAh g-1 has been achieved. This study introduces a novel design strategy to develop redox-active microporous ladder polymers by carefully selecting organic building units for efficient Na+ ion storage.",

        "abstract": "2D transition metal carbides and/or nitrides, MXenes, are a class of widely studied materials with great potential for energy storage applications. The control of surface chemistry is an effective approach for preparing novel MXenes and modifying their electrochemical properties. However, an in-depth and systematic atomic-scale study of the effect of surface termination on MXene stability and electrochemical performance is scarce and thus is highly desired. Here, through high-throughput first-principles calculations, 28 stable chalcogen-functionalized M2 CTz (M = V, Nb, and Ta, T = S, Se, and Te) under different chemical environments are identified. The reduction of termination coverage improves electrical conductivity but weakens in-plane stiffness. Intriguingly, based on charge transfer mechanism, the diffusion barrier of lithium/sodium atoms on the M2 CTz exhibits a volcano-like relationship with termination coverage, and the ion diffusion channel formed in half termination coverage greatly accelerates lithium ion diffusion and returns to or exceeds sodium ion diffusion rate at full termination coverage. V2 CSe2 /Nb2 CSz not only displays the large lithium/sodium capacity (592/409-466 mAhg-1 ) but also exhibits low barrier energy and open-circuit voltage, suggesting a promising candidate anode material for lithium/sodium-ion batteries. These findings provide insights into the design and fabrication of MXenes and tuning the electrochemical performance of MXenes by controlling termination coverage.",

        "abstract": "Stabilizing the electrode interphases is urgently required to enhance the lifetime of high‐voltage sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, the continuous anode solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth associated with electron leakage and the fragile cathode–electrolyte interphase (CEI) lead to capacity fade at high voltage; and yet the solvation‐interphase‐performance relationship is inadequately addressed. Herein, a cooperative Na+‐solvation strategy is reported to stabilize the interphases by a holistic design of electrolytes combining soft and moderate co‐solvents. The rationally regulated Na+‐solvation leads to CEI/SEI with the desired thickness and component stability. As such, remarkable cycling stability is achieved for 4.3‐V Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) cathodes with 83.3% capacity retention over 3000 cycles at 1 C, significantly outperforming the carbonate counterpart (41.6% capacity retention). Meanwhile, the restrained SEI growth via reducing the formation of electron‐leaking Na2CO3 stabilizes the long‐term cycling of the hard carbon (HC) anode. The assembled NVOPF||HC full cells achieve superior rate capability (up to 15 C) and stable cycling stability over 500 cycles. The demonstrated engineering of electrolyte chemistry, Na+‐solvation, and interphase structure/component contributes toward the rational establishment of design rules for high‐voltage SIBs and possibly other similar chemistries.",

        "abstract": "Amorphous silicon (a-Si), due to its satisfactory theoretical capacity, moderate discharge potential, and abundant reserves, is treated as one of the most prospective materials for the anode of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the slow Na+ diffusion kinetics, poor electrical conductivity, and rupture-prone structures of a-Si restrict its further development. In this work, a composite (a-Si@rGO) consisting of porous amorphous silicon hollow nanoboxes (a-Si HNBs) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is prepared. The a-Si HNBs are synthesized through “sodiothermic reduction” of silica hollow nanoboxes at a relatively low temperature, and the rGO is covered on the surface of the a-Si HNBs by electrostatic interaction. The as-synthesized composite anode applying in SIBs exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 681.6 mAh g–1 at 100 mA g–1, great stability over 2000 cycles at 800 mA g–1, and superior rate performance (261.2, 176.8, 130.3, 98.4, and 73.3 mAh g–1 at 100, 400, 800, 1500, and 3000 mA g–1, respectively). The excellent electrochemical properties are ascribed to synergistic action of the porous hollow nanostructure of a-Si and the rGO coating. This research not only offers an innovative synthetic means for the development of a-Si in various fields but also provides a practicable idea for the design of other alloy-type anodes.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) offer several benefits, including cost-efficiency and fast-charging characteristics, positioning them as attractive substitutes for lithium-ion batteries in energy storage applications. However, the inferior capacity and cycling stability of electrodes in SIBs necessitate further enhancement due to sluggish reaction kinetics. In this respect, the utilization of heterostructures, which can provide an inherent electric field and abundant active sites on the surface, has emerged as a promising strategy for augmenting the cycling stability and rate features of the electrodes. This work delves into the utilization of V1.13Se2/V2O3 heterostructure materials as anodes, initially fabricated via a simplified one-step solid-state sintering technique. The high pseudocapacitance and low characteristic relaxation time constant give the V1.13Se2/V2O3 heterostructure impressive properties, such as a high capacity of 328.5 mAh g-1 even after 1500 cycles at a high current density of 2 A g-1 and rate capability of 278.9 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1. Moreover, the assembled sodium-ion full battery delivers a capacity of 118.5 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1.

The outside-in doping on carbon-based anode has been extensively explored.

The S-rich proteins in the albumen can also guide the doping and nucleation of the nickel sulfide nanoparticles. Besides, the porous architecture of the carbonized proteins is achieved through the removable KCl/NaCl salts (medium) at high-temperature melting conditions. And during the carbonization process, the nitrogen can reduce the carbonization temperature of thermally stable carbon materials.

First-principles calculations indicate that nitride MXenes possess a better rate capability than carbide MXenes of the same thickness. Moreover, the barrier for Na diffusion on the Ti2NO2 MXene surface (0.114 eV) is lowest. Meanwhile, comparing the properties of three nitride MXenes with different thicknesses, Ti2NO2 MXene performs relatively well with a high theoretical capacity with 756 mAh g−1 and a lower open circuit voltage of 1.1 V. In conclusion, the performance improvement of nitride MXene is not linear with thickness, because that of Ti3N2O2 MXene is relatively weaker.

        "abstract": "Currently sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) as energy storage technology have attracted lots of interest due to their safe, cost-effective, and nonpoisonous advantages. However, many challenges remain for development of SIBs with high specific capacity, high rate capability, and long cycle life. Therefore, CuS as an important earth-abundant, low-cost semiconductor was applied as anode of SIBs with ether-based electrolyte instead of conventional ester-based electrolyte. By incorporating reduced graphene oxide (RGO) into CuS nanosheets and optimizing the cutoff voltage, it is found that the sodium-ion storage performance can be greatly enhanced using ether-based electrolyte. The CuS-RGO composites deliver an initial Coulombic efficiency of 94% and a maximum specific capacity of 392.9 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g-1. And a specific capacity of 345 mAh g-1 is kept after 450 cycles at a current density of 1 A g-1. Such an excellent electrochemical performance is ascribed to the conductive network construction of CuS-RGO composites, the suppression of dissolved polysulfide intermediates by using ether-based electrolyte, and the avoidance of conversion-type reaction by optimizing the cutoff voltage.",

However, high-temperature battery performances and heat generation measurements have not been systematically reported yet. Carbon-coated Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 )F 3  @MWCNT (multi-walled carbon nanotube) samples were fabricated by a hydrothermal-assisted sol-gel method and the electrochemical performances were evaluated at three different temperatures (25, 45, and 55°C). The well-crystallized Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 )F 3  @MWCNT samples exhibited good cycling stability at both low and high temperatures; they delivered an initial discharge capacity of 120-125 mAhg -1 at a 1C rate with a retention of 53% capacity after 1,400 cycles with 99% columbic efficiency. The half-cell delivered a capacity of 100 mAhg -1 even at a high rate of 10C at room temperature. Furthermore, the Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 )F 3  @MWCNT samples showed good long-term durability; the capacity loss was an average of 0.05% per cycle at a 1C rate at 55°C. Furthermore, ionic diffusivity and charge transfer resistance were evaluated as functions of state of charge, and they explained the high electrochemical performance of the Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 )F 3  @MWCNT samples. In-situ heat generation measurements revealed reversible results upon cycling due to the high structural stability of the material. Excellent electrochemical performances were also demonstrated in the full-cell configuration with hard carbon as well as antimony Sb/C anodes.",

        "abstract": "In light of the impeding depletion of fossil fuels and necessity to lower carbon dioxide emissions, economically viable high-performance batteries are urgently needed for numerous applications ranging from electric cars to stationary large-scale electricity storage. Due to its low raw material cost, non-toxicity and potentially high charge-storage capacity pyrite (FeS2) is a highly promising material for such next-generation batteries. In this work we present the electrochemical performance of FeS2 nanocrystals (NCs) as lithium-ion and sodium-ion storage materials. First, we show that nanoscopic FeS2 is a promising lithium-ion cathode material, delivering a capacity of 715 mA h g(-1) and average energy density of 1237 Wh kg(-1) for 100 cycles, twice higher than for commonly used LiCoO2 cathodes. Then we demonstrate, for the first time, that FeS2 NCs can serve as highly reversible sodium-ion anode material with long cycling life. As sodium-ion anode material, FeS2 NCs provide capacities above 500 mA h g(-1) for 400 cycles at a current rate of 1000 mA g(-1). In all our tests and control experiments, the performance of chemically synthesized nanoscale FeS2 clearly surpasses bulk FeS2 as well as large number of other nanostructured metal sulfides.",

        "abstract": "The natural insulating property and notorious pulverization of volume variation-induced materials during cycling pares the electrochemical activity of red phosphorous (RP) for lithium/sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs). To work out these issues, a tailored trimodal porous carbon support comprising highly ordered macropores and micro-mesoporous walls embedded with copper (Cu) nanoclusters (Cu-OMC) is proposed to confine RP. The construction of highly conductive copper-carbon wall facilitates fast electrons and ions transportation, while the interconnected and ordered porous structure not only creates enough space to resist the expansion effect of RP but also minimizes the ion diffusion length and enhances ion accessibility (the ion migration coefficient is ten times that of disordered porous carbon). Consequently, the resulting Cu-OMC@RP anode delivers a high reversible capacity (2498.7 mAh g-1 at 0.3 C for LIBs; 2454.2 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C for SIBs), superb rate properties (824.7 mAh g-1 at 10 C for LIBs; 774.2 mAh g-1 at 5 C for SIBs), and outstanding cycling stability (an ultralow decay rate of 0.057% per cycle after 1000 cycles at 10 C for LIBs and 0.048% per cycle at 5 C over 500 cycles for SIBs).",

        "abstract": "Developing efficient sodium-ion-storage mechanisms to increase the energy capacity in organic electrodes is a critical issue even after this period of prolonged effort. Uric acid (UA), a simple organic compound with three carbonyl groups is demonstrated to be electrochemically active in the insertion/extraction of Na ions. Theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations reveal that the sodium-ion storage by UA is a result of the stepwise mechanisms of p-π conjugation and the carbon anion. Aside from C═O, the functional group C═C(NH-)2 also provides an efficient Na-storage activated site in which the lone-pair electrons is stabilized through the planar-to-tetrahedral structural transition and low-energy orbital hybridization of N atoms. For further improvement of the electrochemical performance, a uric acid and carbon nanotube (UA@CNT) composite is prepared via a vacuum solution impregnation method. When employed as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries, the UA@CNT composite exhibits high specific capacity, excellent rate capability, and long cycling life even at high current densities. A reversible capacity of over 163 mA h g-1 is maintained even after 150 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g-1. The present study paves a way to develop reversible high-capacity organic electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries by a carbon-anion stabilization mechanism.",

        "abstract": "A sol-gel process followed by heat treatment derived a layered P2-type NaCoO2 cathode, which depicted unit cell parameters values of a = 2.8389 Å, c = 10.9899 Å, and V = 76.71 Å3 in powder X-ray diffraction pattern. The synthesized cathode exhibited hexagonal, 2D platelets with an ∼300 nm thickness. During the anodic and cathodic sweeps, the cyclic voltammograms revealed multiple redox peaks with the same current densities, shapes, and peak positions, associated with the highly reversible phase transition mechanism of the layered P2-type NaCoO2 cathode. The sodium cells yielded the capacities of 93/92 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C and 87/87 mAh g-1 at 1 C for the 50th charge-discharge cycles. The in situ multimode calorimetry (MMC) studies of sodium cells demonstrated a thermal explosion event, which occurred by sodium melting, short-circuit, electrode decomposition reaction, gas generation, exothermic reaction, released heat energy ,and cell gasket melting. Ultimately, the calculated released total heat energies of ∼550/740 J g-1 for in situ MMC studies and ∼312/594 J g-1 for ex situ DSC analyses (charge state at 4 V and discharge state at 2 V) show that the discharged state of sodiated layered P2-type NaCoO2 cathode material is more unsafe than the charge state. Furthermore, the ex situ differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) spectrum of a discharge state at 2 V of layered P2-type NaCoO2 revealed a decreased onset temperature (DOT) at 141 °C with two pronounced exothermic peaks at 197 and 266 °C with a released higher total heat energy of 594 J g-1 than the charge state heat energy at 312 J g-1, attributed to the higher charge onset temperature (COT) at 191 °C. Thus, the observed higher heat energy and decreased onset temperature for the discharge state at 2 V is associated with the higher Na+ ion in the discharge state of the layered P2-type NaxCoO2 cathode than that of the pristine cathode, showcasing that the layered P2-type NaCoO2 cathode is unsafe at the discharged condition for sodium-ion batteries.",

The outstanding cycle characteristic is mainly due to the tiny MCNO nanoparticles, which shorten the ion migration distance, and the three-dimensional DC framework, which remarkably promotes the electronic transfer and efficiently limits the volume expansion during the progress of insertion and extraction of Na+ ions. Moreover, nitrogen doped in carbon is able to improve the electrochemical capability as well. Finally, kinetic analysis of the redox reactions is used to verify the pseudocapacitive mechanism in charge storage and the feasibility of using MCNO@DC composite nanofibers as an anode for sodium-ion batteries with the above-mentioned behavior.",

Herein, theoretical calculations of interfacial interactions of catalysts and polysulfides in terms of the surface adsorption state, interfacial ions migration, and electronic concentration around the Fermi level are systematically proposed as guiding principles of catalyst selection for RT Na–S batteries. As a case, MoN catalyst is accurately selected from transition metal nitrides with different d orbital electrons, and for experiment, it is introduced into the carbon nanofibers as a dual‐functioning host (MoN@CNFs). The MoN@CNFs can effectively anchor polysulfides and accelerate their conversion reaction. In addition, for the sodium anode, the MoN@CNFs can also induce uniform deposition of Na and inhibit dendrite growth, which are supported by in situ characterizations and finite element simulation technique. As a result, the as‐prepared RT Na–S battery displays high reversible capacity of 990 mAh g–1 at 0.2 A g–1 after 100 cycles and long lifespan over 1500 cycles at 2 A g–1.

        "abstract": "Heteroatom doping is an effective method to improve the electrochemical properties of hard carbon anodes for sodium-ion batteries. However, the different roles of surface and bulk heteroatoms in Na storage have not been explored much. Herein, N, P dual-doped carbon nanofibers (NP-CNFs) with high doping contents and low surface area are designed to clarify the above issue. It is confirmed that P plays a more crucial role in Na storage compared with N. In addition, surface and bulk P not only possess different configurations but also show distinct Na storage activity. There are only oxidized POx groups on the surface, which are inactive for Na storage but promote the stability of electrochemistry interphase, while in the bulk phase, unoxidized P-C bonds also emerge except POx, which shows preeminently reversible Na storage activity, and the POx groups are activated simultaneously. Furthermore, P-doping changes the reactivity of N-configurations with Na both on the surface and in the bulk phase, exhibiting interesting synergism. As expected, the surface stability, bulk activity, and synergism enable NP-CNFs to achieve superior performance. It could deliver a prominent capacity of 105.6 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 after 3000 cycles in half cells and 164.3 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 200 cycles in full cells.",

        "abstract": "Biomass-derived hard carbon is a promising anode material for commercial sodium-ion batteries due to its low cost, high capacity, and stable cycling performance. However, the intrinsic tight lignocellulosic structure in biomass hinders the formation of sufficient closed pores, limiting the specific capacity of obtained hard carbons. In this contribution, a mild, industrially mature pretreatment method is utilized to selectively regulate biomass components. The hard carbon with a rich closed pore structure is prepared by optimizing the appropriate ratio of biomass composition. Optimized etching conditions enhanced the closed pore volume of hard carbon from 0.15 to 0.26 cm3 g-1. Consequently, the engineered hard carbon exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, including a high reversible capacity of 346 mAh g-1 with a high plateau capacity of 254 mAh g⁻¹ at 50 mA g⁻¹, robust rate capability, and cycling stability. The optimized hard carbon shows an 88 mAh g⁻¹ increase in plateau capacity compared to hard carbon from directly carbonizing bamboo fibers. This mature approach provides an easy-to-operate industrial pathway for designing high-capacity biomass-based hard carbons for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "title": "Probing the Dynamic Na Metal/Nasicon Interface in Sodium-Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "Interest in solid-state sodium-ion batteries (SSIBs) have resurged remarkably as a means of diversification in energy storage devices to address climate issues and further propelled by the movement of ‘Beyond-Li’. State of the art SSIBs not only offer energy security and sustainability but also comparable power and energy densities to their counter-parts. Yet to fully capitalise on the technology, the fundamental processes taking place between the anode and interface or ‘point of contact’ needs to be understood. Previous iterations of SSIBs have employed various solid-electrolyte candidates – most notable being beta-alumina – however with the recent advancements in synthesis and dopants more prominent solid-electrolytes have become interesting, one in particular being NaSICON (Sodium Super Ionic Conductor). NaSICON has several advantages, one of which is the reduction in operating temperatures of SSIBs due to its inherent fast sodium-ion transport1. This would broaden the potential applications of SSIBs, making the technology more accessible to a wider range of markets.\n Current perspectives on NaSICON solid-electrolytes have focused on optimising conductivity through means of additive dopants2 and synthesis procedures3. Yet at present, the understanding of the fundamentals of interfacial inhomogeneities that affect the performance of these materials in SSIBs is limited. With consideration of the direct implications on performance that surface chemistry has, understanding of this is paramount.\n Evaluation of the chemical evolution of the Na metal/NaSICON interface has been achieved through assessing the changes of the chemical landscape that take place at the surface and near-surface, through surface characterisation techniques that probe the area of interest at varying depths – X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). This has been conducted on samples that have been electrochemically cycled and comparison made to samples in pristine condition. The compositions used to conduct this investigation are Na3Zr2Si2PO12 and Na3.4Zr2Si2.4P0.6O12 – the latter of which has been shown to have one of the highest room temperature sodium-ion conductivity4. Through this, the electronic structure, and hence chemical state, can be deduced alongside a 3D chemical map that will correlate surface chemical changes with electrochemical performance. Thus, a preliminary means of understanding the fundamentals of chemical evolution can be established.\n \n References\n \n \n Lu, G. Xia, J. P. Lemmon, Z.

        "abstract": "In recent years, all‐solid‐state batteries (ASSBs) with metal anodes have witnessed significant developments due to their high energy and power density as well as their excellent safety record. While intergranular dendritic lithium growth in inorganic solid electrolytes (SEs) has been extensively studied for lithium ASSBs, comparable knowledge is missing for sodium‐based ASSBs. Therefore, polycrystalline Na‐β″‐alumina is employed as a SE model material to investigate the microstructural influence on sodium filament growth during deposition of sodium metal at the anode. The research focuses on the relationship between the microstructure, in particular grain boundary (GB) type and orientation, sodium filament growth, and sodium ion transport, utilizing in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements in combination with crystal orientation analysis. The effect of the anisotropic sodium ion transport at/across GBs depending on the orientation of the sodium ion transport planes and the applied electric field on the current distribution and the position of sodium filament growth is explored. The in situ TEM analysis is validated by large field of view post‐mortem secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS) analysis, in which sodium filament growth within voids and along grain boundaries is observed, contributing to the sodium network formation potentially leading to failure of batteries.",

        "title": "Adsorption and Diffusion of Lithium and Sodium on Defective Rhenium Disulfide: A First Principles Study.",
        "abstract": "Single-layer rhenium disulfide (ReS2) is a unique material with distinctive, anisotropic electronic, mechanical, and optical properties and has the potential to be used as an anode in alkali-metal-ion batteries. In this work, first principles calculations were performed to systematically evaluate the potential of monolayer pristine and defective ReS2 as anodes in lithium (Li)- and sodium (Na)-ion batteries. Our calculations suggest that there are several potential adsorption sites for Li and Na on pristine ReS2, owing to its low-symmetry structure. Additionally, the adsorption of Li and Na over pristine ReS2 is very strong with adsorption energies of -2.28 and -1.71 eV, respectively. Interestingly, the presence of point defects causes significantly stronger binding of the alkali-metal atoms with adsorption energies in the range -2.98 to -3.17 eV for Li and -2.66 to -2.92 eV for Na. Re single vacancy was found to be the strongest binding defect for Li adsorption, whereas S single vacancy was found to be the strongest for Na. The diffusion of these two alkali atoms over pristine ReS2 is anisotropic, with an energy barrier of 0.33 eV for Li and 0.16 eV for Na. The energy barriers associated with escaping a double vacancy and single vacancy for Li atoms are significantly large at 0.60 eV for the double-vacancy case and 0.51 eV for the single-vacancy case. Similarly, for Na, they are 0.59 and 0.47 eV, respectively, which indicates slower migration and sluggish charging/discharging. However, the diffusion energy barrier over a Re single vacancy is found to be merely 0.42 eV for a Li atom and 0.28 eV for Na. Overall, S single and double vacancies can reduce the diffusion rate by 103-105 times for Li and Na ions, respectively. These results suggest that monolayer ReS2 with a Re single vacancy adsorbs Li and Na stronger than pristine ReS2, with negligible negotiation with the charging/discharging rate of the battery, and therefore they can be used as an anode in Li- and Na-ion batteries.",

The metalation mechanism consists of highly unusual and previously only speculated Sn (III)-state grasped by operando Raman spectroelectrochemistry aided by symmetry analysis. The prepared 2D material flakes were characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopies. The operando Raman spectroelectrochemistry was chosen as a dedicated tool for the investigation of alkali-metal-ion intercalation (Li, Na, K), whereby the distortion of the A1g Raman active mode (out-of-plane S-Sn-S vibration) during battery charging exhibited a substantial dependence on the electrochemically applied potential. As a result of the structural dynamics a considerable Raman red-shift of 17.6 cm−1 was observed during metalation. Linewidth changes were used to evaluate the expansion caused by metalation, which in case of sodium and potassium were found to be minimal compared to lithium. Based on the spectroscopic and electrochemical results, a mechanism for the de-/intercalation of lithium, sodium and potassium is proposed which includes alloying in few-layer 2D SnS2 materials and the generation of point-defects.",

        "abstract": "A porous MA-VA-PcNi polymer was prepared by grafting nickel phthalocyanine (PcNi) onto the main chain of a maleic anhydride-vinyl acetate (MA-VA) polymer, and an MA-VA-PcNi electrode is prepared by electrospinning technology to inhibit the agglomeration of the active powder effectively, which produces spherical particles with a diameter of 100-300 nm. The synthesized MA-VA-PcNi polymer is used as the anode for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries, exhibiting excellent energy storage behaviors. The MA-VA-PcNi/Li battery displays a high capacity of 610 mA h g-1 and can still remain at 507 mA h g-1 with a retention rate of 83.1% after 400 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g-1. Even at a high current density of 2 A g-1, the specific capacity can remain at 195 mA h g-1. In addition, the MA-VA-PcNi/Na battery displays a high capacity of 336 mA h g-1 and can still remain at 278 mA h g-1 with a retention rate of 82.7% after 400 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g-1. A high specific capacity of 164 mA h g-1 can also be achieved at a high current density of 1 A g-1. After nickel phthalocyanine (PcNi) was grafted onto the MA-VA polymer, aggregation between phthalocyanine rings was effectively prevented, and this exposes more active sites. At the same time, the spherical particles obtained by electrospinning technology further improve the dispersion and increase the number of active sites of the active materials. Finally, the electrode materials show excellent energy storage behavior for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries, which provides a new idea for designing high-performance energy storage materials for organic electrodes.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have attracted widespread attention for cost-effective and large-scale electric energy storage. However, their practical deployment has been largely retarded by the lack of choice of efficient anode materials featuring large capacity and electrochemical stability and robustness. Herein, we report a durian-inspired design and template-free fabrication of a robust sodium electrode based on triangular pyramid arrays of Bi0.75Sb0.25 alloy electrodeposited on Cu substrates. The Bi0.75Sb0.25 arrays exhibit an appreciable electrochemical robustness for sodium storage, sustaining a reversible capability 335 mAh g-1 at a high rate of 2.5 A g-1, and 87% of the initial capacity over 2,000 cycles. We further demonstrate the applicability of the Bi0.75Sb0.25 array anode in sodium full cells by pairing it with a Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode. This full cell achieves a high specific energy of 203 Wh kg-1 (based on both active electrodes). Such an enhanced performance is attributed to the unique thorny-durian-like architecture and bimetallic alloy composition. The pyramid tip induces ion enrichment for rapid charge-transfer reaction, while the alloy design reduces the electrode volume swelling for stable Na cycling.",

Regarding mild chemically activated HCs, the best material (exhibiting a 76% ICE and impressive reversible charge capacities of 354 and 77 mA h g–1 at 0.1 and 2 A g–1, respectively) was the carbon produced via hydrothermal preatretment in HCl aqueous solution and subsequently heated up to 1000 °C.

In particular, the huge volume change of Si makes it very challenging to simultaneously achieve high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and long-term cycle life. Herein, we report spray pyrolysis to prepare Si-SiOx composite using an aqueous precursor solution containing Si nanoparticles, citric acid, and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). In the precursor solution, Si nanoparticles are etched by NaOH with the production of [SiO4]4-. During the dynamic course of spray pyrolysis, [SiO4]4- transforms to SiOx matrix and citric acid decomposes to carbon surface layer with the assistance of NaOH that serves as a decomposition catalyst. As a result, a Si-SiOx composite, in which Si nanodomains are homogeneously embedded in the SiOx matrix with carbon surface layer, is generated by a one-pot process with a residence time of only 3.5 s in a flow reactor. The optimal composite structure in terms of Si domain size and Si-to-O ratio exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, such as reversible capacity of 1561.9 mAh g-1 at 0.06C rate and ICE of 80.2% and 87.9% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1C rate.",

Large-scale electrochemical energy storage is based on the intercalation of metal ions in layered materials having van der Waals gaps. In this work, by means of first-principles calculations, we explored the use of 2D Janus transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) CrSSe, CrSTe and CrSeTe as anode materials for lithium and sodium-ion batteries. To examine the electronic properties and electrochemical performance, density functional theory (DFT) calculation was used. Our research shows that lithium diffuses easily with short diffusion distances and prefers to bind effectively to the monolayer. These structures are metallic in their bare phases.

        "abstract": "Na-ion batteries are promising alternatives to Li-ion systems for electrochemical energy storage because of the higher natural abundance and widespread distribution of Na compared to Li. High capacity anode materials, such as phosphorus, have been explored to realize Na-ion battery technologies that offer comparable performances to their Li-ion counterparts. While P anodes provide unparalleled capacities, the mechanism of sodiation and desodiation is not well-understood, limiting further optimization. Here, we use a combined experimental and theoretical approach to provide molecular-level insight into the (de)sodiation pathways in black P anodes for sodium-ion batteries. A determination of the P binding in these materials was achieved by comparing to structure models created via species swapping, ab initio random structure searching, and a genetic algorithm. During sodiation, analysis of 31P chemical shift anisotropies in NMR data reveals P helices and P at the end of chains as the primary structural components in amorphous Na xP phases. X-ray diffraction data in conjunction with variable field 23Na magic-angle spinning NMR support the formation of a new Na3P crystal structure (predicted using density-functional theory) on sodiation. During desodiation, P helices are re-formed in the amorphous intermediates, albeit with increased disorder, yet emphasizing the pervasive nature of this motif. The pristine material is not re-formed at the end of desodiation and may be linked to the irreversibility observed in the Na-P system.",

In addition, the amorphization and conversion reactions during the electrochemical process of the mesoporous NiS2 nanospheres is also investigated by in situ X-ray diffraction. The impressive electrochemical performance reveals that the NiS2 offers great potential toward the development of next generation large scale energy storage.",

        "abstract": "The enhancement of the structural stability of conversion-based metal sulfides at high current densities remains a major challenge in realizing the practical application of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The instability of metal sulfides is caused by the large volume variation and sluggish reaction kinetics upon sodiation/desodiation. To overcome this, herein, a heterostructured nanocube anode composed of CuS/FeS2 embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon (CuS/FeS2 @NC) is synthesized. Size- and shape-controlled porous carbon nanocubes containing metallic nanoparticles are synthesized by the two-step pyrolysis of a bimetallic Prussian blue analog (PBA) precursor. The simple sulfurization-induced formation of highly conductive CuS along with FeS2 facilitates sodium-ion diffusion and enhances the redox reversibility upon cycling. The mesoporous carbon structure provides excellent electrolyte impregnation, efficient charge transport pathways, and good volume expansion buffering. The CuS/FeS2 @NC nanocube anode exhibits excellent sodium storage characteristics including high desodiation capacity (608 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 ), remarkable long-term cycle life (99.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 5 A g-1 ), and good rate capability up to 5 A g-1 . The simple, facile synthetic route combined with the rational design of bimetallic PBA nanostructures can be widely utilized in the development of conversion-based metal sulfides and other high-capacity anode materials for high-performance SIBs.",

        "abstract": "A simple surfactant-assisted reflux method was used in this study for the synthesis of cocklebur-shaped Fe2O3 nanoparticles (NPs). With this strategy, a series of nanostructured Fe2O3 NPs with a size distribution ranging from 20 to 120 nm and a tunable surface area were readily controlled by varying reflux temperature and the type of surfactant. Surfactants such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (F127) and sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate (SDBS) were used to achieve large-scale synthesis of uniform Fe2O3 NPs with a relatively low cost.

The Fe3O4@CFx composite was utilized as the anode in a lithium ion battery and exhibited a high reversible capacity of 900 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1) over 100 cycles with 95% capacity retention. In addition, a new Fe3O4@CFx/LiNi(0.5)Mn(1.5)O4 battery with a high energy density of 371 Wh kg(-1) (vs cathode) was successfully assembled, and more than 300 cycles were easily completed with 66.8% capacity retention at 100 mA g(-1).

However, their practical application is hindered by the inevitable volumetric expansion during the lithiation/delithiation process. Constructing high-performance binders for SiOx-based anodes has been regarded as an efficient strategy to mitigate their volume expansion and preserve structural integrity. In this work, we propose a green water-solution PAA-LS binder composed of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and sodium lignosulfonate (LS) with fast self-healing properties. The designed binder can be restored due to the strong affinity between Fe3+-catechol coordination bonds, thereby effectively alleviating the volumetric strain of SiOx-based anodes. Notably, with an optimized LS content of 0.5%, the SiOx@PAA-LS electrode exhibits excellent performance, delivering a high capacity of 997.3 mAh g-1 after 450 cycles at 0.5 A g-1. Furthermore, the SiOx||NCM622 full cell also demonstrates superior cycling stability, maintaining a discharge capacity of 147.58 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g-1, with an impressive capacity retention rate of 82.72%.",

EP has been used to characterise LIBs; here, we demonstrate the first application of EP to any NIB material. The voltage versus sodiation fraction curves (voltage profiles) of hard carbon lack clear features, consisting only of a slope and a plateau, making it difficult to clarify the structural features of hard carbon that could optimise cell performance. We find additional features through EP that are masked in the voltage profiles.

        "abstract": "SnS/N-doped graphene (SnS/NG) composites are promising anode materials for sodium ion batteries. Generally, SnS is synthesized from SnCl2·2H2O. However, SnCl2·2H2O is not suitable for large-scale production due to its high price. Compared with SnCl2·2H2O, SnCl4·5H2O has a lower price, more stable chemical properties and better water solubility. Until now, there have been no related reports on the synthesis of SnS from SnCl4·5H2O. In this work, the fabrication of SnS/NG in a facile, two-step process, which combines a hot water bath and thermal annealing and uses SnCl4·5H2O as a precursor, is described. The mechanism of phase transformation in the direct synthesis of SnS from Sn4+ is also discussed in detail. Applying our methodology, SnS nanoparticles were grown in-situ on graphene sheets and wrapped by N-doped graphene sheets to form a 3D SnS/NG composite. With 35.35% content of graphene in the SnS/NG composite, the reversible specific capacity remained at 417.8 mAh/g at 1000 mA/g after 100 cycles, exhibiting a high specific capacity and good cycling stability. In addition, the composite also had an excellent rate performance, with a specific capacity of 366.9 mAh/g obtained even at 5000 mA/g. Meanwhile, the fast sodium storage kinetics of SnS/NG were also analyzed, providing some theoretical support for further study.",

        "abstract": "Biomass-derived hard carbon materials are attractive for sodium-ion batteries due to their abundance, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness. However, their widespread use is hindered by their limited specific capacity. Herein, a type of bamboo-derived hard carbon with adjustable pore structures is developed by employing a ball milling technique to modify the carbon chain length in the precursor. It is observed that the length of the carbon chain in the precursor can effectively control the rearrangement behavior of the carbon layers during the high-temperature carbonization process, resulting in diverse pore structures ranging from closed pores to open pores, which significantly impact the electrochemical properties. The optimized hard carbon with abundant closed pores exhibits a high specific capacity of 356 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1, surpassing that of bare hard carbon (243 mAh g-1) and hard carbon with abundant open pores (129 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1). However, the kinetic analysis reveals that hard carbon with open pores shows better sodium-ion diffusion kinetics, indicating that a balance between the closed and open pores should be considered. This research offers valuable insights into pore design and presents a promising approach for enhancing the performance of hard carbon anode materials derived from biomass precursors.",

However, the severe surface side reactions and dendrites affect the service lifespan and electrochemical performance of ZIBs. Herein, a bifunctional electrolyte additive, l-ascorbic acid sodium (LAA), has been added into ZnSO4 (ZSO) electrolyte (ZSO + LAA) to settle the above issues of ZIBs. On the one hand, the LAA additive tends to adsorb on the Zn anode surface to generate a H2O-resistive passivation layer, which can effectively isolate the H2O corrosion and regulate the Zn2+ ion 3D diffusion, thus inducing a uniform deposition layer. On the other hand, the strong adsorption capacity between LAA and Zn2+ can transform the solvated [Zn(H2O)6]2+ into [Zn(H2O)4LAA], thus reducing the coordinated H2O molecules and further suppressing side reactions. With this synergy effect, the Zn/Zn symmetric battery with the ZSO + LAA electrolyte can deliver a cycle life of 1200 h under 1 mA cm-2, and the Zn/Ti battery also presents an ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency of 99.16% under 1 mA cm-2, greatly superior to the batteries with the ZSO electrolyte.

However, the choice of suitable anode materials is a key step in the application of SIBs. Here, a simple vacuum filtration method is reported to obtain a bimetallic heterojunction structure.

The results show that the electron rich Se site and the internal electric field generated by the electron transfer in the heterojunction structure can provide rich electrochemically active areas and effectively promote the electron transport during sodiation/desodiation.

It has been reported that both materials can intercalate sodium and lithium ions depending on their availability in the electrolyte. This study aims to identify the dominant active species in “Saltwater Batteries” with dual-ion electrolyte. Therefore, cyclic voltammetry of single electrodes as well as full cell measurements are performed with electrolyte containing lithium sulfate, sodium sulfate or a mixture. Moreover, the study is complemented by ion analysis of the electrolyte, as well as X-ray diffraction of fresh and cycled electrodes at different states of charge. The results show that the cathode only (de)intercalates lithium ions, revealing that Li is the dominant active cathode species. The anode can react with both ions and undergoes a formation reaction accompanied by partial dissolution of sodium titanium phosphate. Nevertheless, cyclic voltammetry and full cell measurements indicate that lithium is also the dominant active species on the anode side. In conclusion, the dual-ion battery is dominated by lithium and shows a superior performance when removing sodium from electrolyte.",

        "abstract": "Recently, nanostructured carbon materials, such as hollow‐, yolk‐, and core‐shell‐configuration, have attracted attention in various fields owing to their unique physical and chemical properties. Among them, yolk‐shell structured carbon is considered as a noteworthy material for energy storage due to its fast electron transfer, structural robustness, and plentiful active reaction sites. However, the difficulty of the synthesis for controllable carbon yolk‐shell has been raised as a limitation. In this study, novel synthesis strategy of nanostructured carbon yolk‐shell microspheres that enable to control morphology and size of the yolk part is proposed for the first time. To apply in the appropriate field, cobalt compounds‐carbon yolk‐shell composites are applied as the anode of alkali‐ion batteries and exhibit superior electrochemical performances to those of core‐shell structures owing to their unique structural merits. Co3O4‐C hollow yolk‐shell as a lithium‐ion battery anode exhibits a long cycling lifetime (619 mA h g−1 for 400 cycles at 2 A g−1) and excellent rate capability (286 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1). The discharge capacities of CoSe2‐C hollow yolk‐shell as sodium‐ and potassium‐ion battery anodes at the 200th cycle are 311 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and 268 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, respectively.",

Herein, a novel peapod-like nanostructured material, consisting of Fe2 O3 nanoparticles homogeneously encapsulated in the hollow interior of N-doped porous carbon nanofibers, as a high-performance anode material is reported. The distinctive structure not only provides enough voids to accommodate the volume expansion of the pea-like Fe2 O3 nanoparticles but also offers a continuous conducting framework for electron transport and accessible nanoporous channels for fast diffusion and transport of Li/Na-ions. As a consequence, this peapod-like structure exhibits a stable discharge capacity of 1434 mAh g-1 (at 100 mA g-1 ) and 806 mAh g-1 (at 200 mA g-1 ) over 100 cycles as anode materials for LIBs and SIBs, respectively. More importantly, a stable capacity of 958 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles and 396 mAh g-1 after 1500 cycles can be achieved for LIBs and SIBs, respectively, at a large current density of 2000 mA g-1 .

Characterization of deposits formed using this technique elucidates the presence of stacked and sandwiched 2D heterostructures, and zeta potential measurements confirm the mechanistic interactions driving this assembly.

The application has been also studied for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). The finely crystallized CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (around 5 nm in size) are uniformly grown on the PPy nanotubes. When tested as anode materials for SIBs, the CFO-PPy-NT electrode maintains a discharge capacity of 400 mA h g-1 and a stable Coulombic efficiency of 98% after 200 cycles at 100 mA g-1. Even at a higher current density of 1000 mA g-1, the composite can still retain a discharge capacity of 220 mA h g-1 after 2000 cycles. The superior electrochemical performance could be mainly ascribed to the uniform distribution of CoFe2O4 on the 3-D matrix of PPy interconnected nanotubes, which favors the diffusion of sodium ions and electronic transportation and also buffers the large volumetric expansion during charge/discharge. Thereby our study suggests that such CFO-PPy-NTs have great potential as an anode material for SIBs.",

In order to promote the practical application of sodium-ion batteries, the electrochemical performances, such as specific capacity, reversibility, and rate capability of the anode materials, should be further improved. In this work, a Fe2O3/C composite with a well-ordered mesoporous structure is prepared via a facile co-impregnation method by using mesoporous silica SBA-15 as a hard template. When used as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries, the well-ordered mesoporous structure ensures fast mass transport kinetics. The presence of nano-sized Fe2O3 particles confined within the carbon walls significantly enhances the specific capacity of the composite. The carbon walls in the composite act not only as an active material contributing to the specific capacity, but also as a conductive matrix improving the cycling stability of Fe2O3 nanoparticles. As a result, the well-ordered mesoporous Fe2O3/C composite exhibits high specific capacity, excellent cycleability, and high rate capability. It is proposed that this simple co-impregnation method is applicable for the preparation of well-ordered mesoporous transition oxide/carbon composite electrode materials for high performance sodium-ion and lithium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are promising candidates for large-scale energy storage due to the abundance and low cost of sodium. However, graphite, the primary anode for commercial lithium-ion batteries, cannot be applied to SIBs. Its two-dimensional (2D) counterpart graphene is also inactive toward Na ions because of the delocalized π-electron network. We propose an idea to tackle this problem by introducing kagome topology into the honeycomb lattice, creating localized electronic states for improving the Na storage performance. Herein, we design a form of 2D carbon allotrope (named FSL-graphene), consisting of a kagome and a honeycomb sublattice. It has excellent stability, which is confirmed by the superior cohesive energy, positive phonon modes, high thermal stability, and strong mechanical stability. FSL-graphene exhibits an ultra-high theoretical Na storage capacity of 3347.1 mA h g−1, superior to most previously reported 2D anode materials. In addition, it possesses low diffusion energy barriers (0.19–0.23 eV), low open-circuit voltages (0.59–0.61 V), and small changes in lattice constants (1.3%). Furthermore, the electrolytes with high dielectric constants (e.g., ethylene carbonate) could improve the adsorption and migration of Na on FSL-graphene. This study provides an insight for designing high-performance carbon anode materials for SIBs by focusing on the topological lattices.",

Frogspawn consists of a spawn core and a transparent jelly shell organized in a hierarchical porous array, which exhibits superior mechanical strength and high-efficiency oxygen permeability. It can be used as a model for designing a new high-performance electrode material, which has advantages such as a high surface area, fast mass transport and superior durability. Herein, we report a frogspawn-like NaTi2(PO4)3/C array prepared by a facile preform impregnation strategy. The framework is formed by a hollow carbon sphere connected by the NaTi2(PO4)3/C skeleton, and its hollow is filled with the NaTi2(PO4)3 nanospheres. The whole hierarchical porous three-dimensional array copies the structure of a frogspawn. This unique structure not only enables easy electrolyte percolation and fast electron/ion transport, but also enhances the reversible capacity and cycling durability. When it is applied as an anode of the aqueous sodium ion battery, it exhibits favorable high rate capability and superior cycling stability, and retains 89% of the initial capacity after two thousand cycles at 20 C. Moreover, the full cell using the frogspawn-inspired NaTi2(PO4)3-C as the anode and Na0.44MnO2 as the cathode is capable of ultralong cycling up to one thousand cycles at alternate 10 and 60 C, which is among the best of state-of-the-art aqueous sodium ion systems.

NVPF nanocuboids with sizes of 50-150 nm distributed on rGO can be obtained, delivering excellent electrochemical performance such as a longevity life (a high capacity retention of 85.6% after 7000 cycles at 10 C) and distinguished rate capability (116 mAh g-1 at 50 C with a short discharging/charging time of 1.2 min). The full battery with a Cu2Se anode represents a capacity of 116 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1. The introduction of rGO can augment the electronic conductivity and advance the Na+ diffusion speed, boosting the cycling and rate capability.

The model HC simplifies the 3D sodiation in a typical HC particle into a 2D sodiation, which facilitates the visualization of phase transformation at different states of charge. The results for the first time unveil that the sodiation in HC initiates heterogeneously, with multiple propagation fronts proceeding simultaneously, eventually merging into larger aggregates. The spatial correlation between the preferential adsorption and nucleation sites suggests that the heterogeneous nucleation is driven by the local Na-ion concentration, which is determined by defects or heteroatoms that have strong binding to Na ions. By identifying intercalation as the dominant sodium storage mechanism in the model HC, the findings highlight the importance of engineering the graphene layer orientation and the structural heterogeneity of edge sites to enhance the performances.",

        "title": "DFT-Guided Design of Dual Dopants in Anatase TiO2 for Boosted Sodium Storage.",
        "abstract": "Anatase titanium dioxide (TiO2) has drawn great attention as an anode material in sodium ion batteries (SIBs), but it suffers from the sluggish diffusion kinetics of Na+ within TiO2 and inferior electronic conductivity. Herein, under the guidance of density functional theory (DFT), we propose a nitrogen and selenium dual-doped TiO2 system as an advanced SIB anode. Both DFT and experimental investigations reveal the cooperative effect of dopants in boosting the electrochemical performance of TiO2, finding the optimal content ratio (N/Se at 1:3) for overall improved SIB performances. As expected, experimental results exhibit excellent sodium storage behavior of the N,Se-doped TiO2, including high discharge capacity (142 mAh g-1 at 2 A g-1), good rate performance (82 mAh g-1 at 20 A g-1), and ultralong cyclability (97% retention over 5000 cycles at 2 A g-1). Our study underscores the importance of dual-heteroatom doping in the rational design of advanced electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "NaVPO4F has garnered significant attention as a promising cathode material for non‐aqueous sodium‐ion batteries due to its high theoretical specific capacity and appropriate potential. However, the dissolution of vanadium component of NaVPO4F in aqueous electrolytes has restricted its application in aqueous sodium‐ion batteries (ASIBs). Herein, we report the use of carbon‐coated NaVPO4F as a cathode material in ASIBs. This cathode material exhibited a discharge capacity of 111 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in a concentrated 17 m NaClO4 aqueous solution and demonstrated capacity retention of 74.4 % over 100 cycles. The experimental results confirmed that the carbon coating on NaVPO4F and high‐concentration NaClO4 aqueous electrolyte exhibited positive effects in restraining vanadium dissolution. Additionally, when configuration with NaTi2(PO4)3@C as anode, the full cell exhibited a capacity of 43.9 mAh g−1 with an average operating voltage of 1.2 V at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 in a concentrated 17 m NaClO4 aqueous electrolyte.

        "title": "Highly Fluorinated and Boron Containing Anion Derived Stable Anode and Cathode Interfaces for Long Cycle and High Voltage Sodium Metal Batteries",
        "abstract": "Sodium metal is a propitious anode for the development of next generation metal batteries owing to its low reduction potential (-2.71 V) and high theoretical capacity (1165 mAh g-1)1. Among various electrolytes, carbonate solvents can be useful to develop high voltage metal batteries with wide temperature range2. However, the aggressive reactivity of sodium metal in carbonate electrolytes lead to the formation of unstable solid electrolyte interface on the metal anode which renders poor long cycling performance to the battery3. In this work, we have fabricated thin and inorganic components (F and B rich) rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on Na metal anode and cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) on oxide-based cathode to improve long cycling stability of sodium metal battery. Here, fluorine (F) and boron (B) containing anion is compared with conventional hexafluorophosphate anion (PF6-) in binary carbonate solvent system (EC:EMC). The stable stripping/plating behaviour of both symmetric (Na/Na) and asymmetric cell (Al/Na) in case of F and B containing anion is found compared to the PF6\n - anion.\n The excellent long-term cycling stability of full cell (Na/Na0.67Fe0.5Mn0.5O2) is further attributed to the improved electrochemical stability window and better aluminium passivation on employing F and B containing anion in the electrolyte system as compared to PF6\n - anion. The dual role of F and B containing anion to form stable interfaces on both the anode and cathode side provides a pathway in the development of fluorinated electrolytes for high voltage sodium metal batteries.\n References:\n (1) Yang, T.; Luo, D.; Liu, Y.; Yu, A.; Chen, Z.

Herein, we elaborately designed stable Sb-doped metallic 1T phase molybdenum sulfide (1T-MoS2-Sb) with a few-layered nanosheet structure via a simple calcination technique. The N-doping of the carbon and Sb-doping induce the formation of T-phase MoS2, which not only effectively enhances the entire stability of the structure, but also improves its cycling performance and stability. When employed as an anode of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), 1T-MoS2-Sb exhibits a reversible capacity of 493 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles and delivers prominent long-term performance (253 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 2200 cycles) along with decent rate capability. Paired with a Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, it displays a superior capacity of 242 mA h g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 over 100 cycles, which is one of the best performances of a MoS2-based full cell for SIBs. Employed as the anode for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs), it exhibits a satisfactory specific capacity of 343 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles.

        "abstract": "Transition metal selenides (TMSs) are receiving considerable interest as improved anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their considerable theoretical capacity and excellent redox reversibility. Herein, ZIF-12 (zeolitic imidazolate framework) structure is used for the synthesis of Cu2Se/Co3Se4@NPC anode material by pyrolysis of ZIF-12/Se mixture. When Cu2Se/Co3Se4@NPC composite is utilized as an anode electrode material in LIB and SIB half cells, the material demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance and remarkable cycle stability with retaining high capacities. In LIB and SIB half cells, the Cu2Se/Co3Se4@NPC anode material shows the ultralong lifespan at 2000 mAg-1, retaining a capacity of 543 mAhg-1 after 750 cycles, and retaining a capacity of 251 mAhg-1 after 200 cycles at 100 mAg-1, respectively. The porous structure of the Cu2Se/Co3Se4@NPC anode material can not only effectively tolerate the volume expansion of the electrode during discharging and charging, but also facilitate the penetration of electrolyte and efficiently prevents the clustering of active particles. In situ X-ray difraction (XRD) analysis results reveal the high potential of Cu2Se/Co3Se4@NPC composite in building efficient LIBs and SIBs due to reversible conversion reactions of Cu2Se/Co3Se4@NPC for lithium-ion and sodium-ion storage.",

        "abstract": "High theoretical capacity and low-cost copper sulfide (CuxS)-based anodes have gained great attention for advanced sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, their practical application may be hindered due to their unstable cycling performance and problems with the dissolution of sodium sulfides (NaxS) into electrolyte. Here, we employed metal organic framework (MOF-199) as a sacrificial template to fabricate nanoporous CuxS with a large surface area embedded in the MOF-derived carbon network (CuxS-C) through a two-step process of sulfurization and carbonization via H2S gas-assisted plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) processing. Subsequently, we uniformly coated a nanocarbon layer on the Cu1.8S-C through hydrothermal and subsequent annealing processes. The physico-chemical properties of the nanocarbon layer were revealed by the analytical techniques of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We acquired a higher SIB performance (capacity retention (~93%) with a specific capacity of 372 mAh/g over 110 cycles) of the nanoporous Cu1.8S-C/C core/shell anode materials than that of pure Cu1.8S-C. This encouraging SIB performance is attributed to the key roles of a nanocarbon layer coated on the Cu1.8S-C to accommodate the volume variation of the Cu1.8S-C anode structure during cycling, enhance electrical conductivity and prevent the dissolution of NaxS into the electrolyte. With these physico-chemical and electrochemical properties, we ensure that the Cu1.8S-C/C structure will be a promising anode material for large-scale and advanced SIBs.",

MXenes, as one of the most promising anodes for sodium-ion batteries, have been reported to have many advantages, such as high electronic conductivity and a hydrophilic surface. However, the compact multilayer structure and deficient delamination significantly inhibits their application, requiring high energy and showing decreased storage capacity and poor rate capabilities. Few-layer MXene has been proved to benefit superior electrochemical properties with a better ionic conductivity and two-dimensional layer structure. Herein, we report scale delamination of few-layer MXene nanosheets as anodes for sodium-ion batteries, which are prepared via an organic solvent assist high-energy mechanical-milling method. This approach efficiently prevents the oxidation of MXene and produces few-layer nanosheets structure, facilitating fast electron transport and Na+ diffusion. Electrochemical tests demonstrate that the few-layer MXenes show high specific capacity, excellent cycle stability, and good rate performance. Specifically, few-layer MXene nanosheets deliver a high reversible capacity of 267 mA h g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1. After cycling 1500 cycles at a high rate of 1 A g-1, a reversible capacity of 76 mA h g-1 could be maintained.",

        "abstract": "Developing the three-dimensional self-assembled nanoarchitecture with well-defined crystal structure is an effective strategy to enhance the electrochemical performances of electrode materials. Herein, (110)-oriented and bridged nanoblocks self-assembled VS4 microspheres are controllably synthesized by a facile one-step hydrothermal method. (110)-bridged structure sets up open pathways for Na+ diffusion among nanoblocks, and (110)-oriented structure provides unobstructed pathways for Na+ diffusion in nanoblocks, which collectively construct the multi-dimensional Na+ transfer channels in the VS4 microspheres, and then promote the electrochemical kinetics. This material, as an anode of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), exhibits pseudocapacitive Na+ storage process and excellent rate capability, delivering a high capacity of 339 and 270 mAhg-1 at a rate of 0.1 and 2.0 Ag-1 with a capacity retention of 79% in the voltage window of 0.5 ~ 3.0 V. Particularly, the reversible capacity reaches up to 575 mAhg-1 after 300 cycles even at 1.0 Ag-1 in the voltage window of 0.05 ~ 3.0 V, outperforming those of the ever-reported VS4-based anode materials. This work presents an effective strategy to the exploration and design of high-performance anodes for SIBs.",

        "title": "In-Situ Polymerization in 3D Ceramic Frameworks for High-Performance Composite Solid Electrolytes",
        "abstract": "In the Battery of Things era, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) act as the heart of any electronic device, from tiny devices such as earphones and smart pens to electric vehicles (EVs). Unfortunately, current safety issue associated with conventional LIBs originates from the use of flammable liquid electrolytes. Therefore, solid-state batteries (SSBs) using solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) as a potential candidate can address the safety concerns and revive the lithium metal to further increase the energy density of batteries. Among several types of SSEs such as ceramic electrolytes, solid polymer electrolytes, and composite solid electrolytes (CSEs), CSEs are more attractive by combining the advantages of both ceramic and polymer electrolytes. However, CSEs still suffer from insufficient ionic conductivity at room temperature to meet the requirement for high-performance electrolytes. In this study, 3D ceramic porous framework as a continuous lithium-ion conduction pathway as well as a backbone for in-situ polymer penetration was prepared to overcome the challenge. The synergistic effect of the 3D continuous framework, well-organized polymer, and their interphase enabled high-performance SSEs. A solid-state lithium-ion cell composed of 3D-Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 containing CSE, LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode, and Li metal anode, could operate for 230 cycles by maintaining a high capacity of 118.8 mAh g-1, and showed good rate capability up to 5 C at 30 °C. In addition, a solid-state sodium ion cell composed of 3D-Na3.3Zr1.7La0.3(SiO4)2(PO4) containing CSE, Na3Mg0.05V1.95(PO4)3@C cathode, and Na metal anode achieved a long lifespan of 3000 cycles at 2 C with zero fading and excellent rate capability up to 10 C at 30 °C.",

        "abstract": "The increasing energy demands of society today have led to pursue alternative energy storage systems that can fulfill rigorous requirements like cost-effectiveness and high storage capacities. Based fundamentally on earth-abundant sodium sources, sodium-based batteries are a promising solution in applications where existing lithium-ion technology remains less economically viable, particularly in large-scale stationary systems such as grid-level storage. Although simply replacing lithium with sodium in current lithium-ion batteries is not a viable solution due to deteriorating electron transfer in conventional intercalation cathodes, sodium is highly attractive when leveraging other battery chemistries due to its unique redox reactions. Sodium metal holds great promise as an attractive anode material for sodium-based batteries owing to its high theoretical specific capacity, low electrochemical potential, low cost and high natural abundance. However, its highly reactive nature with organic electrolyte leads to the formation of unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and dendritic/mossy sodium growth. In this talk, I will present a series of versatile strategies to realize diverse high-energy sodium metal battery systems through multi-faceted tactical regulations of the electrode-electrolyte interface, electrode structural design, and electrolyte engineering.",

Tin antimony (Sn2Sb3), as an anode, exhibits a remarkable theoretical capacity of 753 mAhg−1 that has not been realized so far for reaching the theoretical capacity; pulverization of sulfide-based material [copper sulfide (CuS)] along with tin antimonide would be a better option for obtaining a high-performance anode for SIBs. Hence, an attempt is made to study the pulverisation effects of these two materials when employed as an anode for SIBs. The pulverised compound CuS: Sn2Sb3 delivers an initial discharge capacity of 659 mAhg−1 at 0.1 Ag−1 vs. Na/Na+ with high stability retaining up to 100% efficiency over 100 cycles.

        "abstract": "Sodiophilic micro‐composite films of sodium‐chalcogenide intermetallics (Na2Te and Na2S) and Cu particles are fabricated onto commercial copper foam current collectors (Na2Te@CF and Na2S@CF). For the first time a controllable capacity thermal infusion process is demonstrated. Enhanced wetting by the metal electrodeposition leads to state‐of‐the‐art electrochemical performance. For example, Na2Te@CF‐based half‐cells demonstrate stable cycling at 6 mA cm−2 and 6 mAh cm−2, corresponding to 54 µm of Na electrodeposited/electrodissolved by geometric area. Sodium metal batteries with Na3V2 (PO4)3 cathodes are stable at 30C (7 mA cm−2) and for 10 000 cycles at 5C and 10C. Cross‐sectional cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo‐FIB) microscopy details deposited and remnant dissolved microstructures. Sodium metal electrodeposition onto Na2Te@CF is dense, smooth, and free of dendrites or pores. On unmodified copper foam, sodium grows in a filament‐like manner, not requiring cycling to achieve this geometry. Substrate–metal interaction critically affects the metal–electrolyte interface, namely the thickness and morphology of the solid electrolyte interphase. Density functional theory and mesoscale simulations provide insight into support‐adatom energetics, nucleation response, and early‐stage morphological evolution. On Na2Te sodium atomic dispersion is thermodynamically more stable than isolated clusters, leading to conformal adatom coverage of the surface.",

In this paper, the preparation of CuO quantum dots (≈2 nm) delicately embedded in carbon nanofibers (denoted as 2-CuO@C) with a thin film via a feasible electrospinning method is reported. The CuO content can be controlled by altering the synthetic conditions and is optimized to 54 wt%.

The enhancement of electrochemical performance is attributed to the unique structure of 2-CuO@C, which offers a variety of advantages: highly conductive carbon matrix suppressing agglomeration of CuO grains, interconnected nanofibers ensuring short transport length for electrons, well-dispersed CuO quantum dots leading to highly utilization rate, and good mechanical properties resulting in strong electrode integrity.",

        "abstract": "Practical implementation of alkali metal batteries currently still faces formidable challenges because of the dendrite growth upon continuous charge/discharge processes and the associated unstable solid–electrolyte interphase. Herein, it is reported that dendrites can be fundamentally mitigated in lithium and sodium metal batteries by regulating the Li+ and Na+ flux using a glass fiber (GF) separator impregnated with polytetrafluoroethylene nanospheres (PTFE‐NSs), which results in homogeneous deposition of Li and Na during charging. The COMSOL Multiphysics simulations reveal that the introduction of negatively charged PTFE‐NSs into the GF separator enhances the local electric field near the anode, thereby boosting the transfer of cations. It is demonstrated that Li//Li and Na//Na symmetric cells utilising a PTFE‐GF separator show outstanding cycle stability of 1245 and 2750 h, respectively, at 0.5 mA cm−2. Moreover, the Li//LiFePO4 and Na//Na3V2(PO4)2F3 full cells exhibit remarkably improved capacity retention when cycled at 1 C, in the presence of a PTFE‐GF separator. The nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies suggest that the impregnation of PTFE‐NSs into GF helps “liberate” more Li+ and Na+ and changes the coordination interaction between ions and solvents, contributing to the enhanced electrochemical performance.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are recognized as promising energy storage devices. However, they suffer from rapid capacity decay at ultra-low temperatures due to high Na+ desolvation energy barrier and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, a weakly solvating electrolyte (WSE) with decreased ion-dipole interactions is designed for stable sodium storage in hard carbon (HC) anode at ultra-low temperatures. 2-methyltetrahydrofuran with low solvating power is incorporated into tetrahydrofuran to regulate the interactions between Na+ and solvents. The reduced Na+-dipole interactions facilitate more anionic coordination in the first solvation sheath, which consistently maintains anion-enhanced solvation structures from room to low temperatures to promote inorganic-rich SEI formation. These enable WSE with a low freezing point of -83.3°C and faster Na+ desolvation kinetics. The HC anode thus affords reversible capacities of 243.2 and 205.4 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 at -40 and -60°C, respectively, and the full cell of HC||Na3V2(PO4)3 yields an extended lifespan over 250 cycles with high capacity retention of ~100% at -40°C.

        "title": "Development of Lithium/Sodium-Ion Battery Electrodes Based on Solvent Engineered Tin(II) Oxide Nanomaterials",
        "abstract": "With the global economy pushing towards a greener and cleaner energy future for the world, renewable energy storage technologies must continue to develop and improve to allow for a seamless transition from the ways of the past to a carbon neutral future. To this end, renewable battery technology and in particular the capacity of the anode must be improved. Furthermore this improvement must be made across various battery technologies (Lithium/Sodium-ion) and be cost-effective to allow for its widespread implementation and use worldwide.\n In this work, Tin(II) Oxide (SnO)/single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) composite electrodes are analysed as a possible alternative dual anode material for both lithium (LIB) and sodium-ion batteries (NIB). The LIB is limited by the current commercial anode material of graphite with a relatively low theoretical capacity of 372 mAh g-1 whilst NIBs use hard carbon with a capacity of roughly 300 mAh g-1. Alloy/de-alloy materials are envisioned to be a suitable candidate for next generation LIBs/NIBs due to their large specific capacities (875mAh g-1/ 847 mAh g-1 for SnO respectively) although major drawbacks concern the poor cycling life associated with the volume change and the associated irreversible capacity. To overcome such issues the downsizing of materials and the fabrication of composites which incorporate both lithium active and inactive material are viewed as promising solutions. Nanostructured metal oxides, forming an inactive oxide matrix are appealing candidates.\n Through the implementation of a solvent engineered wet chemistry synthesis, various layered SnO microparticles are produced with several morphologies well-suited to energy storage applications. This synthesis method is facile, scalable and is favourable in comparison to hydrothermal synthesese normally used to synthesise nanomaterials. While SWCNTs are themselves not suited towards energy storage applications, their incorporation in the electrodes allows them to act as a conductive additive at a lower weight loading than other conventional carbon sources (carbon black/graphite), presenting a more effective strategy to form an effective electrical percolation network while also removing the need for polymer binders/copper current collector.\n The optimised morphology of SnO produces a high capacity, high rate and stable anode for LIB technology. An initial coloumbic efficiency (ICE) in excess of 80% is recorded and a stable cycling capacity of 815 mAh g-1 at 0.5C after 300 cycles is also achieved, demonstrating its long term stability. A maximum capacity of 980 mAh g-1 is recorded at 0.1C, whilst high rate capacities of 775, 671 and 364 mAh g-1 are recorded at 1,2 and 5C respectively. Furthermore a full-cell is composed with a NMC cathode to demonstrate a potential full-cell real world device. As an NIB anode, a maximum capacity of 568 mAh g-1 was recorded at 0.05C, whilst a low ICE of 50% proves an issue under further investigation. Furthermore a cycling capacity of 595 mAh g-1 is recorded after 50 cycles at 0.1C, dropping to 360 mAh g-1 at 100 cycles which is still in excess of that recorded for hard carbon in NIBs.\n A high capacity, scalable and cost effective anode has been developed that is interchangeable between LIBs/NIBs and exceeds the performance of the current commercial anodes.\n \n Reference\n s\n :\n \n \n [1] S.

The co-existence of two alkali metals in an anode raises a question: whether the liquid Na-K alloy acts as a Na or a K anode. Here we show the alkali-metal that is stripped from the liquid Na-K anode is dependent on the preference of the cathode host. It acts as the anode of a sodium rechargeable cell if the cathode host structure selectively accepts only Na+ ions; as the anode of a potassium rechargeable cell if the cathode accepts K+ ions in preference to Na+ ions. This dual-anode behavior means the liquid Na-K alkali-alloy can be applied as a dendrite-free anode in Na-metal batteries as well as K-metal batteries.",

        "abstract": "The metal anode is the pivotal component for advanced sodium‐metal batteries such as Na–O2 batteries. Designing a 3D confinement scaffold is a promising strategy for constructing dendrite‐free sodium‐metal anodes; however, cycling stability at a large current density (>10 mA cm−2) is still difficult to realize. Herein, the design of new lightweight and fibrous hydroxylated Ti3C2 (h‐Ti3C2) MXene based scaffolds with stepped sodiophilic gradient structure (h‐M‐SSG) is reported, and its thickness can be controlled (80−250 µm). The sodiophilic gradient structure (adjusted by h‐Ti3C2) can effectively induce sodium ions to preferentially deposit at the bottom of the scaffold, thus inhibiting dendrite growth. h‐M‐SSG/Na‐based symmetrical batteries exhibit a low polarization voltage and long cycling life at a high current density (40 mA cm−2) and a high cut‐off capacity (40 mAh cm−2). Moreover, a Na–O2 battery with an h‐M‐SSG/Na anode exhibits a low potential gap of 0.137 V after 45 cycles at 1000 mA g−1 and 1000 mAh g−1. This deposition‐regulation strategy would inspire the design of 3D scaffolds for high‐performance sodium‐metal‐anode‐based batteries.",

        "abstract": "SnO2 has been considered as a promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium ion batteries (SIBs), but challenging as well for the low-reversible conversion reaction and coulombic efficiency. To address these issues, herein, SnO2 quantum dots (≈5 nm) embedded in porous N-doped carbon matrix (SnO2 /NC) are developed via a hydrothermal step combined with a self-polymerization process at room temperature. The ultrasmall size in quantum dots can greatly shorten the ion diffusion distance and lower the internal strain, improving the conversion reaction efficiency and coulombic efficiency. The rich mesopores/micropores and highly conductive N-doped carbon matrix can further enhance the overall conductivity and buffer effect of the composite. As a result, the optimized SnO2 /NC-2 composite for LIBs exhibits a high coulombic efficiency of 72.9%, a high discharge capacity of 1255.2 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles and a long life-span with a capacity of 753 mAh g-1 after 1500 cycles at 1 A g-1 . The SnO2 /NC-2 composite also displays excellent performance for SIBs, delivering a superior discharge capacity of 212.6 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 3000 cycles. These excellent results can be of visible significance for the size effect of the uniform quantum dots.",

Using density functional theory combined with molecular dynamics simulation and a grand potential phase diagram analysis, we find that the resulting Na3La5Cl18 exhibits high energetic stability with a small energy-above-hull of 18 meV per atom, a large band gap of 5.58 eV, a wide electrochemical window of 0.41-3.76 V from the cathodic to the anodic limit, and a high Na+ conductivity of 1.3 mS/cm at 300 K. Furthermore, Na3La5Cl18 shows high chemical interface stability with the reported high-potential cathode materials such as NaCoO2, NaCrO2, Na2FePO4F, Na3V2(PO4)3, and Na3V2(PO4)2F3.

        "abstract": "Composite cathodes have attracted great attentions due to the integrated advantages of each pure structure. And the component ratio deserves a carefully modulation to further improve the corresponding electrochemical performance. Mn-based layer-tunnel hybrid composite became a focus in sodium ion batteries due to the supe-riority in high performance, low cost and non-toxicity. In the previous reports, the structure modulation was car-ried out via changing the synthesis condition, varying the transition metal element ratio, and different ion doping. And it is still challenging to explore a more feasible method to simplify the adjustment process. Herein, we intro-duced Mg2+ into Na sites or transition metal sites in Na0.6MnO2 and firstly discovered the doping-sites variation induced structure adjustment phenomenon. Specifically, Mg doping in transition metal sites could be beneficial for the growth of the P2-type structure while layer/tunnel component ratio decreased when locating Mg2+ in Na sites. The P2-O2 phase transformations could be effectively suppressed by locating Mg2+ in both sites could the in high voltage regions and thus improve cycling performance. The designed material, Na0.6Mn0.99Mg0.01O2, could attain a decent capacity of 100 mA h g-1 at 1000 mA g-1 and a satisfied retention of 76.6 % after 500 cycles. Ad-ditionally, ex situ XRD experiments verify the excellent structural stability of Mg-substituted samples during charge-discharge processes. Moreover, the Na0.6Mn0.99Mg0.01O2 also displays superior sodium-ion full-cell proper-ties when merged with hard carbon anode. Thus, this research may indicate a proper novel thread for designing high-performance composite electrodes.",

However, small molecular organic materials suffer from issues such as low conductivity and the high dissolution rate in electrolytes. Herein, a phthalocyanine derivative (TPcDS) with a large non-localized π-electron system, obtained through thermodynamic polymerization of 4-aminophthalonitrile (AP) monomers, is designed to address these issues. According to the density function theory calculation, six sodium ions can be attracted by one polymer molecule, indicating a high theoretical capacity of 375 mA h g-1 . The TPcDS molecule realizes sodium storage through a non-localized π-electron system of phthalocyanine macrocycles. When employed as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries, the functional groups of phthalocyanine macrocycles, such as CN groups in TPcDS, experience obviously reversible structural variation upon discharge/charge.

        "abstract": "Highly crystalline CuFeS2 containing earth-abundant and environmentally friendly elements prepared via a high-temperature synthesis exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance as an anode material in sodium-ion batteries. The initial specific capacity of 460 mAh g-1 increases to 512 mAh g-1 in the 150th cycle and then decreases to a still very high value of 444 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 in the remaining 550 cycles. Even for a large current density, a pronounced cycling stability is observed. Here, we demonstrate that combining the results of X-ray powder diffraction experiments, pair distribution function analysis, and 23Na NMR and Mössbauer spectroscopy investigations performed at different stages of discharging and charging processes allows elucidation of very complex reaction mechanisms. In the first step after uptake of 1 Na/CuFeS2, nanocrystalline NaCuFeS2 is formed as an intermediate phase, which surprisingly could be recovered during charging. On increasing the Na content, Cu+ is reduced to nanocrystalline Cu, while nanocrystalline Na2S and nanosized elemental Fe are formed in the discharged state. After charging, the main crystalline phase is NaCuFeS2. At the 150th cycle, the mechanisms clearly changed, and in the charged state, nanocrystalline CuxS phases are observed. At later stages of cycling, the mechanisms are altered again: NaF, Cu2S, and Cu7.2S4 appeared in the discharged state, while NaF and Cu5FeS4 are observed in the charged state. In contrast to a typical conversion reaction, nanocrystalline phases play the dominant role, which are responsible for the high reversible capacity and long-term stability.",

We introduce diethylenetriamine pentaacetate sodium salt (DTPA-Na) as a novel electrolyte additive to address these challenges. DTPA-Na's unique dual functionality enables the formation of robust, multi-layered solid electrolyte interphases (SEI) on the zinc anode and stable cathode electrolyte interphases (CEI) on the MnOOH cathode. This synergistic SEI/CEI engineering approach effectively suppresses interfacial side reactions, promotes uniform zinc deposition, and inhibits dendrite growth, leading to exceptional cycling stability and self-discharge inhibition. Asymmetrical cells employing DTPA-Na achieve an unprecedented 32,000 cycles at a high charging rate of 50 mA/cm2, while symmetric cells demonstrate a lifespan of 160 hours with 95% zinc utilization. Full Zn||MnOOH cells exhibit remarkable stability, maintaining 98.61% capacity retention after 720 hours of self-discharge and negligible capacity decay over 5000 cycles.

However, it is still trapped seriously by the inborn bottleneck of low‐softening‐point (LSP) characteristics of CP itself. Herein, an efficient Bi(NO3)3·5H2O‐assisted electrospinning‐carbonization methodology is creatively devised to obtain flexible HCNFs films directly from LSP CP. The essential roles of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and pre‐oxidation in constructing flexible films are rationally proposed. With further regulation in Bi(NO3)3·5H2O dosage and calcination temperatures, specific micro‐structures/morphologies of flexible HCNFs films are finely optimized. The optimum HCNFs‐1.2 film is endowed with robust structural flexibility/stability, high‐content active oxygen/nitrogen groups, abundant graphic microcrystalline zones of large interlayer spacing, and convenient ion‐diffusion channels. Thanks to such remarkable merits, HCNFs‐1.2 retains a large reversible capacity of 125.3 mAh g‒1 over 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g‒1, when evaluated as a self‐supporting film anode for sodium dual‐ion batteries (SDIBs).

Meanwhile, it is found that the Na2 S additive does not generate additional gas during the initial charging process, and under an appropriate content, its reaction product has no adverse impact on the cycling stability and rate performance of SIBs.

        "abstract": "Nowadays, the extended usage of lithium/sodium ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs) encounters nerve-wracking issues, including a lack of suitable reservoirs and high thermal runaway hazards. Although using TiO2 and Li4Ti5O12 has been confirmed to be effective in improving battery safety, their low theoretical capacities inevitably cause damage to the electrochemical performance of the battery. Achieving win-win results has become an urgent necessity. This study designed a metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived in situ carbon-coated metal selenide (Ni-Se@G@C) as the anode. When the current density is 0.1-0.3 A g-1, the initial capacity of LIBs reaches 993.2 mAh g-1, which increases to 1478.9 mAh g-1 after running 800 cycles. When running at 2 A g-1, the cell also offers a relatively high capacity of 458.3 mAh g-1 after 1500 cycles. After the replacement of graphite with Ni-Se@G@C, the self-heating temperature (T0) and thermal runaway triggering temperature (T1) of half and full cells are significantly increased. Meanwhile, the maximum thermal runaway temperature (T2) and maximal heating release rate (HRRmax) are significantly reduced. Of note, the usage of Ni-Se@G@C enables the battery with superior cycling and rate performance. When used in SIBs, the cell gives an initial discharge capacity of 624.9 mAh g-1, which still remains at 269.4 mAh g-1 after running 200 cycles at 1 A g-1. Notably, Ea of the Ni-Se@G@C cell is 5.6 times higher than that of the graphite cell, corroborating the promoted safety performance. This work provides a new paradigm for MOF-derived micro/nanostructures, enabling the battery with an excellent electrochemical and safety performance portfolio.",

        "abstract": "Na‐superionic‐conductor (NASICON)‐type cathodes (e.g., Na3V2(PO4)3) have attracted extensive attention due to their open and robust framework, fast Na+ mobility, and superior thermal stability. To commercialize sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), higher energy density and lower cost requirements are urgently needed for NASICON‐type cathodes. Herein, Na3.5V1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 (NVFP) is designed by an Fe‐substitution strategy, which not only reduces the exorbitant cost of vanadium, but also realizes high‐voltage multielectron reactions. The NVFP cathode can deliver extraordinary capacity (148.2 mAh g−1), and decent cycling durability up to 84% after 10 000 cycles at 100 C. In situ X‐ray diffraction and ex situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations reveal reversible structural evolution and redox processes (Fe2+/Fe3+, V3+/V4+, and V4+/V5+) during electrochemical reactions. The low ionic‐migration energy barrier and ideal Na+‐diffusion kinetics are elucidated by density functional theory calculations. Combined with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fe with unpaired electrons in the 3d orbital is inseparable from the higher‐valence redox activation. More competitively, coupling with a hard carbon (HC) anode, HC//NVFP full cells demonstrate high‐rate capability and long‐duration cycling lifespan (3000 stable cycles at 50 C), along with material‐level energy density up to 304 Wh kg−1. The present work can provide new perspectives to accelerate the commercialization of SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), particularly molybdenum diselenides (MoSe2), have the merits of their unique two-dimensional (2D) layered structures, large interlayer spacing (∼0.64 nm), good electrical conductivities, and high theoretical capacities when applied in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) as anode materials. However, MoSe2 remains suffering from inferior stability as well as unsatisfactory rate capability because of the unavoidable volume expansion and sluggish charge transport during lithiation-delithiation cycles. Herein, we develop a simultaneous reduction-intercalation strategy to synthesize expanded MoSe2 (e-MoSe2) with an interlayer spacing of 0.98 nm and a rich 1T phase (53.7%) by rationally selecting the safe precursors of ethylenediamine (NH2C2H4NH2), selenium dioxide (SeO2), and sodium molybdate (Na2MoO4). It is noteworthy that NH2C2H4NH2 can effectively reduce SeO2 and MoO42- forming MoSe2 nanosheets; in the meantime, the generated ammonium (NH4+) efficiently intercalates between MoSe2 layers, leading to charge transfer, thus stabilizing 1T phases. The obtained e-MoSe2 exhibits high capacities of 778.99 and 611.40 mAh g-1 at 0.2 and 1 C, respectively, together with excellent cycling stability (retaining >90% initial capacity at 0.2 C over 100 charge-discharge cycles). It is believed that the material design strategy proposed in this paper provides a favorable reference for the synthesis of other transition metal selenides with improved electrochemical performance for battery applications.",

        "abstract": "\n Group IVA elements exhibit interesting Na storage capabilities due to the success of their Li alloy analogues. However, beyond hard carbon, they remain poorly understood as anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Here, kinetic investigations of the electrochemical sodiation of Si and Ge are conducted using liquid electrolytes and half-cell configurations. Sodiation of Ge is found to be kinetically limited rather than thermodynamically limited. Either increasing temperature or decreasing sodiation rate can facilitate easier transformations from Ge to Na-Ge phases. A critical temperature seems to exist between 50 and 60℃, beyond which a higher sodiation capacity is evident. The phase transformations are analyzed using Kolmogorov–Johnson–Mehl–Avrami theory. Following a one-dimensional growth, the Ge to NaGe4 is determined to be diffusion limited whereas NaGe4 to Na1+xGe is controlled by reaction speed. Moreover, the Arrhenius equation is employed to investigate the temperature dependence on both phase transformations, giving activation energies of ~50 kJ·mol-1 and ~70 kJ·mol-1, respectively. Schematic models are proposed to elucidate the sodiation mechanisms, potentially influencing sought-after advancements in cell formats and classifications. Not only does this work lay the foundation for efforts on the Ge-based anodes, but also provides analogous kinetic information to Si/Sn-based ones for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "MoS2 is the most promising anode material for secondary battery with its unique 2D layered structure. However, the application of MoS2 is restricted by the poor electrical conductivity and sluggish ion diffusion. Herein, hollow nanotubes constructed with highly conductive 1T phase MoS2 nanosheets and polypyrrole (PPy) nanotubes are fabricated and used as anode materials for lithium‐ion batteries and sodium‐ion batteries. Remarkably, these hollow nanotubes show a high lithium‐specific capacity of 755.5 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and excellent sodium‐specific capacity of 503.3 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles. The enhanced electrochemical performance can be attributed to the rational design of unique 1D and 2D composite structure. First, the highly conductive 1T phase MoS2 2D nanosheets and hollow 1D PPy nanotube can effectively promote the charge transfer kinetics. However, the increased interlayer spacing of 1T phase MoS2 rapidly improves the insertion/extraction process of metal ions, and the vertical growth of MoS2 nanosheets on the surface of the PPy nanotubes also exposes more energy storage sites. This work provides a new idea for the preparation of MoS2‐based composite materials, and also proposes a reference for its application in the secondary battery.",

However, the eco-efficient and environmentally friendly fabrication of separators with a high mechanical strength, excellent thermal stability, and good electrolyte wettability is still challenging. Herein, we reported the fabrication of a new type of separators for Li/Na-ion batteries through the self-assembly of eco-friendly chitin nanofibers derived from prawn shells. We demonstrated that the pore size in the chitin nanofiber membrane (CNM) separator can be tuned by adjusting the amount of pore generation agent (sodium dihydrogen citrate) in the self-assembly process of chitin nanofibers. By optimizing the pore size in CNM separators, the electrochemical performance of the LiFePO4/Li half-cell with a CNM separator is comparable to that with a commercialized polypropylene (PP) separator. More attractively, the CNM separator showed a much better performance in the LiFePO4/Li cell at 120 °C and Na3V2(PO4)3/Na cell than the PP separator. The proposed fabrication of separators by using natural raw materials will play a significant contribution to the sustainable development of renewable energy storage systems.",

The reflux-synthesized hybrid shows a well-overlapped 2D structure, while the solvothermally prepared hybrid forms a segregated phase in which the contact area between the CONs and GNs is reduced. These two hybrids synthesized by facile methods are fully characterized, and the results reveal that their energy-storage properties can be significantly improved by enhancing the electrical conductivity via the formation of a well-overlapped structure between CONs and GNs. The discharge capacity and rate capability of the reflux-synthesized hybrid was considerably larger than that of the bare CONs, highlighting that the improvement in the charge-carrier transport properties can improve the accessibility of Na ions to the surface of the hybrids. This synthetic methodology can be extended to the fabrication of high-performance anodes for Na-ion batteries.",

        "title": "Covalent Pinning of Highly Dispersed Ultrathin Metallic-Phase Molybdenum Disulfide Nanosheets on the Inner Surface of Mesoporous Carbon Spheres for Durable and Rapid Sodium Storage.",
        "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenide materials show potential for use in alkali metal ion batteries owing to their remarkable physical and chemical properties. Nevertheless, the electrochemical energy storage performance is still impaired by the tendency of aggregation, volume, and morphological change during the conversion reaction and poor intrinsic conductivity. Until now, ultrathin molybdenum disulfide nanosheets with a metallic-phase structure on the inner surface of mesoporous hollow carbon spheres (M-MoS2@HCS) have rarely been investigated as an anode for sodium-ion batteries. In this work, a novel M-MoS2@HCS anode was designed and synthesized by employing a template-assisted solvothermal reaction. Structural and chemical analyses indicate that the M-MoS2 nanosheets with a larger interlayer spacing compared to their semiconductor counterpart grow on the inner surface of HCS via covalent interactions. When used as the anode materials for Na+ storage, the M-MoS2@HCS anode presents durable and rapid sodium storage properties. The developed electrode shows a reversible capacity of 291.2 mAh g-1 at a high current density of 5 A g-1. After 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1, the reversible capacity is 401.3 mAh g-1 with a capacity retention rate of 79%. After 2500 cycles at 1.0 A g-1, the electrode still delivers a reversible capacity of 320.1 mAh g-1 with a capacity retention rate of 75%. The excellent sodium storage capability of the MoS2@HCS electrode is explained by the special structural design, which reveals great potential to accelerate the practical applications of transition-metal dichalcogenide electrodes for sodium storage.",

Nb2O5 NCs/rGO was synthesized by controllable hydrolysis of niobium ethoxide and followed by heat treatment at 450 °C in flowing forming gas. Transmission electron microscopy images showed that Nb2O5 NCs with average particle size of 3 nm were uniformly deposited on rGO sheets and voids among Nb2O5 NCs existed. The architecture of ultrafine Nb2O5 NCs anchored on a highly conductive rGO network can not only enhance charge transfer and buffer the volume change during sodiation/desodiation process but also provide more active surface area for sodium ion storage, resulting in superior rate and cycle performance. Ex situ XPS analysis revealed that the sodium ion storage mechanism in Nb2O5 could be accompanied by Nb(5+)/Nb(4+) redox reaction and the ultrafine Nb2O5 NCs provide more surface area to accomplish the redox reaction.",

        "abstract": "Waste management is one of the biggest environmental challenges worldwide. Biomass-derived hard carbons, which can be applied to rechargeable batteries, can contribute to mitigating environmental changes by enabling the use of renewable energy. This study has carried out a comparative environmental assessment of sustainable hard carbons, produced from System A (hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) followed by pyrolysis) and System B (direct pyrolysis) with different carbon yields, as anodes in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). We have also analysed different scenarios to save energy in our processes and compared the biomass-derived hard carbons with commercial graphite used in lithium-ion batteries. The life cycle assessment results show that the two systems display significant savings in terms of their global warming potential impact (A1: −30%; B1: −21%), followed by human toxicity potential, photochemical oxidants creation potential, acidification potential and eutrophication potential (both over −90%). Possessing the best electrochemical performance for SIBs among our prepared hard carbons, the HTC-based method is more stable in both environmental and electrochemical aspects than the direct pyrolysis method. Such results help a comprehensive understanding of sustainable hard carbons used in SIBs and show an environmental potential to the practical technologies.

        "title": "Effect of Partial Cation Replacement on Anode Performance of Sodium-Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "Due to their high specific capacity and long cycle life, bimetallic sulfides are the preferred choice of researchers as anodes in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, studies indicate that this class of materials often requires expensive elements such as Co, Sb, Sn, etc., and their performance is insufficient with the use of inexpensive Fe, V alone. Therefore, there is a need to explore the relationship between metal cations and anode performance so that the requirements of cost reduction and performance enhancement can be met simultaneously. In this work, a series of partially replaced sulfides with different cation ratios have been prepared by a hydrothermal method followed by heat treatment. By partially replacing Co in NiCo sulfides, all samples show improved capacity and stability over the original NiCo sulfides. As a result, the metal elements have different oxidation states, which leads to a higher capacity through their synergistic effects on each other. Mn-NiCoS with 10% replacement showed satisfactory capacity (721.09 mAh g−1 at 300 mA g−1, 662.58 mAh g−1 after 20 cycles) and excellent cycle life (85.41% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 2000 mA g−1).",

Defect engineering, such as single-heteroatom doping and oxygen vacancies, has proven to be effective methods to improve the conductivity of TiO2, but a comprehensive understanding of the synergistic effect of dual-heteroatom doping and oxygen vacancies on the sodium storage performance of TiO2 is still lacking. Herein, we design a synergistic strategy of dual doping via the in situ doping and hydrogenation treatment to improve conductivity and cycling stability of TiO2. Experiments and theoretical calculations together revealed that N and C doping reduces the band gap of TiO2, while the presence of oxygen vacancies efficiently accelerates the diffusion of sodium ions. Thus N, C, and oxygen vacancies with high concentration co-doped TiO2, resulting in extraordinary high-rate performance, significant stable cycling, and long-term cyclability of up to 10,000 cycles. The synthesis strategy of dual doping proposed here emphasizes the importance of defect engineering in improving material conductivity and electrode cycling stability for possible practical applications in the near future.",

        "abstract": "Sodium resources are inexpensive and abundant, and hence, sodium-ion batteries are promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries. However, lower energy density and poor cycling stability of current sodium-ion batteries prevent their practical implementation for future smart power grid and stationary storage applications. Tin oxides (SnO2) can be potentially used as a high-capacity anode material for future sodium-ion batteries, and they have the advantages of high sodium storage capacity, high abundance, and low toxicity. However, SnO2-based anodes still cannot be used in practical sodium-ion batteries because they experience large volume changes during repetitive charge and discharge cycles. Such large volume changes lead to severe pulverization of the active material and loss of electrical contact between the SnO2 and carbon conductor, which in turn result in rapid capacity loss during cycling. Here, we introduce a new amorphous carbon-coated SnO2-electrodeposited porous carbon nanofiber (PCNF@SnO2@C) composite that not only has high sodium storage capability, but also maintains its structural integrity while ongoing repetitive cycles. Electrochemical results revealed that this SnO2-containing nanofiber composite anode had excellent electrochemical performance including high-capacity (374 mAh g(-1)), good capacity retention (82.7%), and large Coulombic efficiency (98.9% after 100th cycle).",

However, the severe volume expansion during cycling can cause the electrode material to collapse and reduce the cycle life. Here, novel CoP‐C@MoS2/C nanocube composites are synthesized by vapor‐phase phosphating and hydrothermal process. As the anode of LIBs, CoP‐C@MoS2/C exhibits outstanding long‐cycle performance of 369 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1 after 2000 cycles. In SIBs, the composite also displays excellent rate capability of 234 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1 and an ultra‐high the capacity retention rate of 90.16% at 1 A g−1 after 1000 cycles. Through density functional theory, it is found that the S ions and P ions at the interface formed by CoP and MoS2 can serve as Na+/Li+ diffusion channels with an action of van der Waals force, have attractive characteristics such as high ion adsorption energy, low expansion rate and fast diffusion kinetics compared with MoS2.

        "abstract": "Sodium dendrite growth is responsible for short circuiting and fire hazard of metal batteries, which limits the potential application of sodium metal anode. Sodium dendrite can be effectively suppressed by applying mechanically robust electrolyte in battery systems. Herein, a composite gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) is designed and fabricated, mainly consisting of graphene oxide (GO) and polyvinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP). With the addition of an appropriate amount of GO content, the compressive Young's modulus of 2 wt% GO+PVDF-HFP (2-GPH) composite GPE is greatly enhanced by a factor of 10, reaching 2.5 GPa, which is crucial in the suppression of sodium dendrite growth. As a result, uniform sodium deposition and ultralong reversible sodium plating/stripping (over 400 h) at high current density (5 mA cm-2 ) are achieved. Furthermore, as evidenced by molecular dynamics simulation, the GO content facilitates the sodium ion transportation, giving a high ionic conductivity of 2.3 × 10-3 S cm-1 . When coupled with Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 cathode in a full sodium metal battery, a high initial capacity of 107 mA h g-1 at 1 C (1 C = 117 mA g-1 ) is recorded, with an excellent capacity retention rate of 93.5% and high coulombic efficiency of 99.8% after 1100 cycles.",

The potential synergistic effects arising from the multi‐element doping benefit to improve the electrochemical behavior of porous carbon. In this paper, a facile doping strategy has been proposed to prepare the (N, Co, Zr, P) tetra‐doped porous carbon spheres (PCS) for enhanced lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs). The metal‐organophosphine framework (MOPF) as precursor is synthesized by utilizing riboflavin sodium phosphate as organic ligand coordinating with cobalt and zirconium ions. Through carbonizing MOPF, the (N, Co, Zr, P) tetra‐doped PCS can be obtained. As the anode for LIBs, the (N, Co, Zr, P) tetra‐doped PCS exhibits highly reversible capacity of 761 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles, excellent rate performance of 126 mAh g−1 even at a high current density of 2 A g−1. The results feature that the unique 3D structure and superior local electron transport properties of (N, Co, Zr, P) tetra‐doped PCS promote the Li+ diffusion and adsorption, which improve the electrochemical properties. Moreover, the mechanism analysis realizes that the Li+ storage of (N, Co, Zr, P) tetra‐doped PCS is determined by the capacitive behavior at high scan rate, highlighting the significance of the heteroatom doping. Therefore, the (N, Co, Zr, P) tetra‐doped PCS should be considered as prominent candidate for high‐performance LIBs anodes.",

In this paper, SnSb nanoparticles were distributed uniformly in N-doped three-dimensional porous carbon (SnSb@N-PC), which effectively avoided the agglomeration of alloy nanoparticles and greatly improved the capacity retention rate of SnSb@N-PC. At the same time, the porous carbon substrate brings higher conductivity, larger specific surface area, and more sodium storage sites, which makes the material obtain excellent sodium storage properties.

Meanwhile, the specific capacity of SnSb@N-PC was kept at 323 mAh g−1 after 400 cycles at a high current density of 1.5 A g−1, which indicated that the recombination of SnSb with porous carbon played a key role in the electrochemical performance of SnSb. The contribution of capacitance contrast capacity was able to reach more than 90% by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) test at high sweep speed, and larger Na+ diffusivity was obtained by the constant current intermittent titration technique (GITT) test, which explains the good rate performance of SnSb@N-PC.",

Herein, a universal method is reported for making hierarchical hollow carbon nanospheres (HCSs) with intimately coupled ultrathin carbon nanosheets and Mo‐based nanocrystals. The in situ and confined reaction of the synthetic strategy can not only allow the aggregation of the nanocrystals to be impeded, but also endows extremely intimate coupled interaction between the conductive carbon nanosheets and the nanocrystals MoM (M = P, S, C and O). As a proof of concept, the as‐prepared MoP/C HCSs exhibit extraordinary hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalytic activity with small overpotential and robust durability in both acidic and alkaline solutions. In addition, the unique sheet‐on‐sheet MoS2/C HCSs as an anode demonstrate high capacity, great rate capabilities, and long‐term cycles for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs).

        "abstract": "Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has emerged as a candidate anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, their applications still face challenges of poor rate performance and low initial coulomb efficiency (ICE), which are induced by the unstable solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) and sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics in conventional ester-based electrolytes. Herein, inspired by the electrode/electrolyte interfacial chemistry, tetrahydrofuran (THF) is exploited to construct an advanced electrolyte and reveal the relationship between the improved electrochemical performance and the derived SEI film on TiO2 anode. The robust and homogeneously distributed F-rich SEI film formed in THF electrolyte favors fast interfacial charge transfer dynamics and excellent interfacial stability. As a result, the THF electrolyte endows the TiO2 anode with greatly improved ICE (64.5%), exceptional rate capabilities (186 mAh g−1 at 5.0 A g−1), and remarkable cycling stability. This study elucidates the control of interfacial chemistry by rational electrolyte design and offers insights into the development of high-performance and long-lifetime TiO2 anode.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) is most likely to be a commercialized anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, its low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) impedes its further large-scale industrialization. Since the ICE is greatly related to the side reactions of the electrolyte on the HC surface, herein, we focus on tailoring the surface chemistry of HC via a facile low-temperature oxygen plasma (LTOP) treatment technique. The modified HC after a suitable treatment time possesses a highly ordered and low defect surface without a negligible change in layer spacing, thus facilitating Na+ deinsertion/insertion and reducing the HC/electrolyte side reactions. Moreover, LTOP treatment also brings oxygen functional groups (CO) to the HC surface to enrich Na+ storage active sites. Consequently, the modified HC reveals a higher ICE of 80.9% compared to 60.6% in the bare HC. Also, the modified HC delivers an ultrahigh specific capacity of 331.0 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and exhibits superior rate performance with a high specific capacity of 211.0 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1. This work provides a feasible strategy to tailor the surface chemistry of HC for high-efficiency Na-storage and provides a novel avenue to construct high-efficiency SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have emerged as a promising alternative to Li-ion batteries due to the abundance of sodium. However, anodes in Na-ion batteries face challenges such as dendrite formation and an unstable solid electrolyte interface layer. To address these challenges, NaK liquid metal alloy anodes have been proposed as an alternative because they do not form dendrites. In our study, we demonstrate that the NaK alloy anode interacts with the commonly used ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate electrolyte, leading to a continuously growing unstable SEI layer, evidenced by cycling failures under 100 cycles and an increasing charge transfer resistance in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies. In situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that over the course of cycling the surface of the NaK anode becomes increasingly sodium-rich. After 30 cycles, XPS analysis detects only trace amounts of potassium on the NaK anode surface. When the electrolyte is analyzed postcycling using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, there is a noticeable increase in potassium levels, suggesting that potassium metal dissolves into the electrolyte. The introduction of a 10 wt % fluoroethylene carbonate additive can mitigate this problem to some extent, enabling an enhanced cycling performance of up to 800 cycles at 1C. Nevertheless, the dissolution of K metal is still evident in the XPS results, albeit to a lesser degree. These discoveries provide valuable insights for designing a more robust SEI layer for the NaK anode.",

Combining the cation-solvent co-intercalation and anion storage chemistry, such a SDIB operated with ether-based electrolyte can intrinsically eliminate the sluggish desolvation process. Hence, it can exhibit an extremely fast kinetics of 10 A g -1 (corresponding to 100C-rate) with a high capacity retention of 45%. Moreover, the desolvation-free mechanism endows the battery with 61% of its room-temperature capacity at an ultra-low temperature of -70°C.

In this work, we synthesize ultra-small SnS quantum dots (QDs) anchored onto nitrogen-enriched carbon (NC) nanospheres through facile hydrothermal and carbonization processes to prepare a progressive anode material for sodium-ion batteries. The optimized SnS QDs@NC electrode delivered an initial discharge capacity of 281 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 and exhibited excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 75% after 500 cycles at high current density of 1,000 mA g-1.

A sodium-ion full cell assembled with SnS QDs@NC anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode exhibited high capacity and good cycling stability. Such a superior electrochemical performance of SnS QDs@NC can be attributed to the synergistic effects of NC and SnS QDs, where NC serves as a conducting matrix to support SnS QDs and helps avoid structural degradation.

Here, we present the synthesis, characterization, and application of lignin-derived ordered mesoporous carbons with various pore sizes (from 5 to approximately 50 nm) as anodes in sodium-ion batteries. We have varied the pore size using self-synthesized PEOn-b-PHAm block copolymers with different PEO and PHA chain lengths, applying the “soft templating” approach to introduce isolated spherical pores of 20 to 50 nm in diameters. The pore structure was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nitrogen physisorption, and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). We report the microstructure analysis of such mesoporous lignin-based carbons using Raman spectroscopy and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). In comparison with nontemplated carbon and carbons templated employing commercial Pluronic F-127 and PIB50-b-PEO45, which created accessible channels and spherical pores up to approximately 10 nm in diameter, the carbon microstructure analysis revealed that templating with all applied polymers significantly impedes graphitization upon thermal treatment. Furthermore, the gained knowledge of similar carbon microstructures regardless of the type of template allowed the investigation of the influence of different pore morphologies in carbon applied as an anode material in sodium-ion batteries, supporting the previous theories in the literature that closed pores are beneficial for sodium storage while providing insights into the importance of pore size.",

To this end, the electronic properties, adsorption energy, diffusion energy barrier, open‐circuit voltage (OCV), and theoretical capacity are evaluated. The density of states calculations indicate that BPNT and BBPNT with zero band gap have a metallic character, which is critical for electron transferring in electrode materials. The calculation of adsorption energies suggests that the inside of the tube has better adsorption than the outside. Also, doping with boron improves the adsorption inside and outside the nanotube. Sodium ion sees three ways to penetrate from the outside to the inside of the tube. Calculations illustrate that the bigger ring with eight atoms with a 7.08 eV energy barrier, compared to the other cavities, is more appropriate for diffusion. This energy decreases to 5.84 eV after boron doping. The OCV profile of BBPNT confirms that this structure is in the acceptable voltage range for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs).

        "abstract": "Metal oxalate has become a most promising anode candidate material for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries. However, there exists the problem of capacity decrease due to the volume expansion of the active material during cycling. Herein, the rodlike CoC2O4·2H2O/rGO hybrid has been fabricated via a novel multi-step solvo/hydro-thermal strategy. The structure characteristic of microrod CoC2O4·2H2O wrapped using rGO sheet not only inhibits the volume variation of the hybrid electrode during the cycle, but also accelerates the transfer of electrons and ions amongst the 3D graphene network, thereby improving the electrochemical properties of CoC2O4·2H2O. The CoC2O4·2H2O/rGO electrode delivers specific capacity of 1011.5 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 200 cycles for lithium storage, and exhibits high capacity of 221.1 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 100 cycles for sodium storage. Moreover, the full cell CoC2O4·2H2O/rGO//LiCoO2 consisted of the CoC2O4·2H2O/rGO anode and LiCoO2 cathode maintains 138.1 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at 0.2 A g-1 and has superior long-cycle stability. In addition, in-situ Raman, in-situ and ex-situ X-ray diffraction techniques have provided a unique opportunity to fully understand the reaction mechanism of CoC2O4·2H2O/rGO. This work also supplies a new perspective and certain research basis for the application of metal oxalate materials in high performance lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries.",

        "title": "Coupled Carbonization Strategy toward Advanced Hard Carbon for High-Energy Sodium-Ion Battery.",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are expected to be a promising commercial alternative to lithium-ion batteries for grid electricity storage due to their potential low cost in the near future. Up to the present, the anode material still remains a great challenge for the application of SIBs, especially at room temperature. Graphite has an obvious limitation to store larger radius sodium ions (Na+) in comparison with lithium ions (Li+), while the hard carbon with large interlayer distance can demonstrate a relatively high storage capability and durable cycle life. However, the disadvantages of low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) mainly caused by large surface area and high cost synthetic approach hinder its practical applications. Herein, a new coupled carbonization strategy is presented to prepare a cost-effective hard carbon material by pyrolyzing and carbonizing the mixture of abundant sucrose and phenolic resin. Benefiting from the specialized pyrolysis reaction process and optimized conditions as studied in detail, the hard carbon has an extremely low surface area of 1.54 m2 g-1 and high initial Coulombic efficiency of 87%, which have been rarely reported before and enhance the utilization efficiency of Na+ consumption within the cathode in the future. More importantly, the hard carbon, with a high interlayer distance 3.95 Å, can deliver a higher capacity of 319 mAh g-1 and maintain a finer capacity retention of 90% over 150 cycles. Besides, a full cell with the configuration of as-prepared hard carbon anode versus an air-stable O3-Na0.9[Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48]O2 cathode is further presented, and it has a high ICE of 80% and energy density of 256 Wh kganode-1 (vs hard carbon) with reliable cycle performance. The results demonstrate that our synthetic strategy is feasible and extendable, while the tunable carbon-based materials should have wider applications in addition to the attractive properties in Na-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Low utilization of active metallic sodium (Na) and uncontrollable growth of Na dendrites remain significant challenges for high-performance Na metal batteries, which are limited to inefficient Na-utilization (<1%) and shallow cycling conditions (0.25-1.0 mAh cm-2). In this work, a kind of Na metal anode with record-high utilization and long-term cycling stability is reported, using carbon substrate-supported nitrogen-anchored zinc (Zn) single atoms as current collector. Single Zn atom sites serve as a strong \"magnet\" for Na ions, which guide the metallic Na uniform nucleation and free from dendrite-induced short circuit. The nucleation overpotential of our strategy is essentially zero, where most of the reported modified substrates are greatly exceed 20 mV. Specifically, the Na anodes exhibit a high Na stripping/plating Coulombic efficiency with 99.8% over 350 cycles and a stable voltage response with small voltage hysteresis after cycling 1000 h. The full cell exhibits high Na-utilization up to 100% and superior long-term cycling stability for more than 1000 cycles with excellent capacity retention. In terms of both lifetime and Na-utilization, our strategy are significantly outperforms the reported state-of-the-art Na metal anodes. Moreover, this affords new insights into the controllable Na nucleation behavior and high Na utilization, and sheds a fresh light on atomic level design of electrode for Na metal anodes.",

        "abstract": "Structural phase transitions can be used to alter the properties of a material without adding any additional elements and are therefore of significant technological value. It was found that the hexagonal-SnS2 phase can be transformed into the orthorhombic-SnS phase after an annealing step in an argon atmosphere, and the thus transformed SnS shows enhanced sodium-ion storage performance over that of the SnS2, which is attributed to its structural advantages. Here, we provide the first report on a SnS@graphene architecture for application as a sodium-ion battery anode, which is built from two-dimensional SnS and graphene nanosheets as complementary building blocks. The as-prepared SnS@graphene hybrid nanostructured composite delivers an excellent specific capacity of 940 mAh g(-1)and impressive rate capability of 492 and 308 mAh g(-1) after 250 cycles at the current densities of 810 and 7290 mA g(-1), respectively. The performance was found to be much better than those of most reported anode materials for Na-ion batteries. On the basis of combined ex situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and ex situ X-ray diffraction, the formation mechanism of SnS@graphene and the synergistic Na-storage reactions of SnS in the anode are discussed in detail. The SnS experienced a two-structural-phase transformation mechanism (orthorhombic-SnS to cubic-Sn to orthorhombic-Na3.75Sn), while the SnS2 experienced a three-structural-phase transformation mechanism (hexagonal-SnS2 to tetragonal-Sn to orthorhombic-Na3.75Sn) during the sodiation process. The lesser structural changes of SnS during the conversion are expected to lead to good structural stability and excellent cycling stability in its sodium-ion battery performance. These results demonstrate that the SnS@graphene architecture offers unique characteristics suitable for high-performance energy storage application.",

        "abstract": "An advanced nanostructure with rational micro/mesoporous distribution plays an important role in achieving high electrochemical performance in sodium ion batteries (SIBs), especially the energy storage efficiency in the low-potential region during the charging/discharging processes. Here we propose a method of polymer-blended bacterial cellulose (BC) matrix to tune the micro/mesopores of polymer-BC derived carbon under a mild carbonization temperature. The targeted pore structure and electrochemical performance are optimized by controlling the amount of methyl methacrylate monomers via free-radical polymerization, and carbonized temperature via pyrolysis treatment. The constructed carbon materials display a stable 3D fibrous network with a large specific area and abundant micro/mesopores formed during the pyrolysis of the polymer poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Taking advantage of the constructed pore structure, the optimized carbon anodes derived from BC/PMMA composites show an enhanced Na+ diffusion rate with a high capacity of 380.66 mA h g-1 at 0.03 A g-1. It is interesting that it possesses superior low-potential capacity, and retains 42% of the total capacity even at a high scan rate of 1 mV s-1. The proposed method of polymer-blended on cellulose matrix provides an energy-efficient way to achieve high low-potential capacity under facile processing conditions for fast sodium ion transport in SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbons are promising candidates for high-capacity anode materials in alkali metal-ion batteries, such as lithium- and sodium-ion batteries. High reversible capacities are often coming along with high irreversible capacity losses during the first cycles, limiting commercial viability. The trade-off to maximize the reversible capacities and simultaneously minimizing irreversible losses can be achieved by tuning the exact architecture of the subnanometric pore system inside the carbon particles. Since the characterization of small pores is nontrivial, we herein employ Kr, N2 and CO2 gas sorption porosimetry, as well as H2O vapor sorption porosimetry, to investigate eight hard carbons. Electrochemical lithium as well as sodium storage tests are compared to the obtained apparent surface areas and pore volumes. H2O, and more importantly CO2, sorption porosimetry turned out to be the preferred methods to evaluate the likelihood for excessive irreversible capacities. The methods are also useful to select the relatively most promising active materials within chemically similar materials. A quantitative relation of porosity descriptors to the obtained capacities remains a scientific challenge.",

        "abstract": "With a high theoretical capacity, the MnS anode, however, exhibits a rather complex sodium diffusion kinetics and poor mechanical stability that hinder its application in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). In this work, a simple, economical, and scalable strategy is developed to inherently coat nanoporous MnS with a 3D N, S co-doped thin carbon layer by using commercially available MnCO3 as precursors. Specifically, the strategy involves a two-step annealing process, which converts the MnCO3 microparticles into nanoporous Mn2O3 and MnS step by step. The 3D N, S codoped carbon layer is in situ formed during the second annealing process by first coating the nanoporous Mn2O3 with a polyaniline layer. Due to the inherent 3D carbon protection and the strong electronic interaction between N, S dopants and MnS, the N, S codoped carbon protected MnS obtained at 900 °C (NS-C@MnS-900) anode displays a high specific capacity of 845 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, which is higher than all reported MnS-based SIB anodes. It also shows an outstanding cyclability and rate performance, maintaining a stable capacity of ≈493 mAh g-1 after 1300 cycles at 10 A g-1, which is also the best according to knowledge.

The Na storage mechanism is investigated by synchrotron‐based X‐ray scattering and absorption techniques as well as by electrochemical measurements. A very high reversible capacity in the 500th cycle of 489 mAh g−1 is observed at 2.0 A g−1 in the potential window 3.0–0.1 V. Full discharge includes irreversible generation of Ni0 and Cr0 nanoparticles embedded in nanocrystalline Na2S yielding shortened diffusion lengths and predominantly surface‐controlled charge storage. During charge, Ni0 and Cr0 are oxidized, Na2S is consumed, and amorphous Ni and Cr sulfides are formed. Limiting the potential window to 3.0–0.3 V an unusual nickel extrusion sodium insertion mechanism occurs: Ni2+ is reduced to nanosized Ni0 domains, expelled from the host lattice, and is replaced by Na+ cations to form O3‐type like NaCrS2. Surprisingly, the discharge and charge processes comprise Na+ shuttling between highly crystalline NiCr2S4 and NaCrS2 enabling a superior long‐term stability for 3000 cycles.

Recently, eminent researchers have criticised the implementation of e.g. low active material contents/electrode loadings, the use of research‐type battery cell constructions, or the lack of statistically relevant data, resulting in overstated data and thus giving misleading predictions of the key performance indicators of new battery technologies. Here, we report on the establishment of a reference system for the development of sodium‐ion batteries. Electrodes are fabricated under relevant conditions using 9.5 mg/cm² self‐synthesised Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode active material and 3.6 mg/cm² commercially available hard carbon anode active material. It is found that different types of battery cells are more or less suitable for half‐ and/ or full‐cell testing, resulting in ir/reproducible or underestimated active material capacities. Furthermore, the influence of electrode overhang, which is relevant for upscaling, is evaluated. The demonstrator cell (TRL 4‐5) has been further characterised providing measured data on the power/energy density and thermal behaviour during rate testing up to 15 C and projections are made for its practical limits.",

        "abstract": "Transition‐metal sulfides are promising electrochemical energy storage materials due to their abundant active sites, large interlayer space, and high theoretical capacities, especially for sodium storage. However, the low conductivity and poor cycling stability at high current densities hamper their applications. Herein, a versatile dual‐template method is reported to elaborate ordered mesoporous single‐layered MoS2/carbon composite with high specific area, uniform pore size, and large pore volume. The single‐layered MoS2 is confined in the carbon matrix. The mesopores between the composite nanorods provide fast electrolyte diffusion. The obtained nanocomposite shows a high sodium‐storage capability, excellent rate capacity, and very good cycling performance. A capacity of 310 mAh g−1 can remain at 5.0 A g−1 after 2500 cycles. Furthermore, a sodium‐ion battery (SIB) full cell composed of the MoS2/carbon composite anode and a Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode maintains a specific capacity of 330 mAh g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 during 100 cycles. The mechanism is investigated by in situ and ex situ characterizations as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations.",

Pertaining to sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), we design and fabricate Sb and Sn embedding porous carbon wires (PCWs) with SSO encapsulated (SSO@Sn/Sb‐PCWs) composite as a high capability anode in this study. Not only accelerate the Na+ ions diffusion, but also augment the stress resistance and the electrochemical reaction reversibility for the multiphase composite. Furthermore, the porous structure finely increases the ions diffusion kinetics, preventing the aggregation of Sn, Sb, and SSO particles, which achieves high reversible capacity while eliminating structure damage. As a consequence, the fabricated SSO@Sn/Sb‐PCWs electrode exhibited exceptional cycling stability, maintaining a high reversible capacity of 448 mAh g−1 after 150 charge/discharge cycles, and good rate capability with current density up to 5.0 A g−1.

Working electrode is combined with a sodium plate and a solution of NaClO4 in ethyl carbonate/dimethyl carbonate in a homemade cell having an X‐ray transparent window. X‐ray absorption spectra at the S K‐edge and Mo L3‐edge are recorded using a synchrotron source, X‐ray emission S Kα and Mo Lα spectra are obtained on a laboratory spectrometer for initial powder and electrode material at different potentials of the cell. Analysis of the spectra shows the occupation of the initially empty orbitals of MoS2 by sodium electrons as a result of the interaction of the components of the sodium‐ion half‐cell. Ex situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of a fully discharged electrode material reveal partial transformation of hexagonal MoS2 to disordered tetragonal MoS2 coated with a surface electrolyte interphase layer.

The morphological evolution of different-sized single Sn nanoparticle is visualized during the charge/discharge cycles by using a homemade planar electrode. All of the Sn nanoparticles exhibit a dramatic initial volume expansion of about 420% after sodiation to Na15Sn4.

However, the absence of suitable anode materials is the main bottleneck for the commercial application of SIBs. Herein, the adsorption and diffusion behaviors of Na on graphether are predicted by first-principles density functional calculations. Our results show that Na atoms can be adsorbed on graphether forming a uniform and stable coverage on both sides. Even at low intercalated Na concentrations, the semiconducting graphether can be changed to a metallic state, ensuring good electrical conductivity. Due to the structural anisotropy of graphether, the Na+ ions show a remarkable one-dimensional diffusion with an ultralow energy barrier of 0.04 eV, suggesting ultrafast charge/discharge characteristics. The graphether monolayer has a high theoretical specific capacity of 670 mA h g-1, which is much higher than commercial graphite anode materials. Furthermore, the average voltage is 1.58 V, comparable with that of commercial TiO2 anode materials for LIBs (1.5 V). During the charge/discharge process, graphether could mostly preserve the structural integrity upon the adsorption of Na even at the maximum concentration, suggesting its good reversibility. All these results show that graphether is a promising anode material for high-performance SIBs.",

It was determined that the obtained carbon material, with hollow and tubular structure (TSFC), exhibits the best electrochemical performance, with a high ICE of 76.7%, possessing a large layer spacing, a moderate specific surface area, and a hierarchical porous structure. In order to better understand the sodium storage behavior in this special structural material, exhaustive testing was performed.

As a proof of concept, some of the phosphate of Na3V2(PO4)3 was replaced by silicate to fabricate Na3V2(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1, which exhibited a higher average discharge voltage of 3.36 V and a higher capacity of 115.8 mA h g-1 than pristine Na3V2(PO4)3 (3.31 V, 109.6 mA h g-1) at 0.5 C, therefore improving the energy density. Moreover, the introduced silicate enhanced the intrinsic electroconductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3 materials, as confirmed by both theoretical simulation and electrochemical measurements. After pairing with a commercial hard carbon anode, the optimized Na3V2(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1 cathode enabled a stable-cycling full cell with 90.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 5 C and a remarkable average coulombic efficiency of 99.88%.",

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (SIB) are among the most promising devices for large scale energy storage. Their stable and long-term performance depends on the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), a nanosized, heterogeneous and disordered layer, formed due to degradation of the electrolyte at the anode surface. The chemical and structural properties of the SEI control the charge transfer process at the electrode–electrolyte interface, thus, there is great interest in determining these properties for understanding, and ultimately controlling, SEI functionality. However, the study of the SEI is notoriously challenging due to its heterogeneous nature and minute quantity. In this work, we present a powerful approach for probing the SEI based on solid state NMR spectroscopy with increased sensitivity from dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). Utilizing exogenous (organic radicals) and endogenous (paramagnetic metal ion dopants) DNP sources, we obtain not only a detailed compositional map of the SEI but also, for the first time for the native SEI, determine the spatial distribution of its constituent phases. Using this approach, we perform a thorough investigation of the SEI formed on Li4Ti5O12 used as a SIB anode. We identify a compositional gradient, from organic phases at the electrolyte interface to inorganic phases toward the anode surface. We find that the use of fluoroethylene carbonate as an electrolyte additive leads to performance degradation which can be attributed to formation of a thicker SEI, rich in NaF and carbonates. We expect that this methodology can be extended to examine other titanate anodes and new electrolyte compositions, offering a unique tool for SEI investigations to enable the development of effective and long-lasting SIBs.",

To overcome these drawbacks, liquid-phase exfoliated graphene (LEGr) was used as the support, for which MoS2@LEGr heterostructures with a tunable loading amount of MoS2 were fabricated by a microwave-assisted solvothermal method. LEGr with its exceptional atomic structure not only serves as a robust structural support of MoS2 but also provides rapid electrical and ionic transfer pathways of the electrode material. When MoS2@LEGr heterostructures were applied for SIB anodes, the heterostructures exhibited a considerably enhanced sodium storage performance compared to pure MoS2, including higher sodium storage capacity as well as superior cycling stability and rate capability.",

        "abstract": "We present structural and electrochemical analyses of a new double-wolframite compound: AgNa(VO2F2)2 or SSVOF. SSVOF is fully ordered and displays electrochemical characteristics that give insight into electrode design for energy storage beyond lithium-ion chemistries. The compound contains trioxovanadium fluoride octahedra that combine to form one-dimensional chain-like basic building units, characteristic of wolframite (NaWO4). The 1D chains are stacked to create 2D layers; the cations Ag(+) and Na(+) lie between these layers. The vanadium oxide-fluoride octahedra are ordered by the use of cations (Ag(+), Na(+)) that differ in polarizability. In the case of sodium-ion batteries, thermodynamically, the use of a sodium anode introduces a 300 mV loss in overall cell voltage as compared to a lithium anode; however, this can be counter-balanced by introduction of fluoride into the framework to raise the reduction potentials via an inductive effect. This allows sodium-ion batteries to have comparable voltages to lithium systems. With SSVOF as a baseline compound, we have identified new materials design rules for emerging sodium-ion systems that do not apply to lithium-ion systems. These strategies can be applied broadly to provide materials of interest for fundamental structural chemistry and appreciable voltages for sodium-ion electrochemistry.",

        "title": "Unlocking Rapid and Robust Sodium Storage Performance of Zinc-Based Sulfide via Indium Incorporation.",
        "abstract": "Zinc sulfide (ZnS) exhibits promise in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of its low operation voltage and high theoretical specific capacity. However, pristine ZnS is not adequate in realizing rapid and robust sodium storage owing to its low reversibility, poor structure stability, and sluggish kinetics. To date, most efforts focus on utilizing carbonaceous incorporation to improve its electrochemical performances. Nevertheless, it remains an arduous challenge for realizing superior rate capability while obtaining stable cycling. Herein, inspired by the crystal structure of hexagonal ZnIn2S4, which possesses an intrinsic layered feature with larger unit-cell volume versus that of ZnS, indium incorporation is thus deployed as an immediate remedy. In/ex situ investigations combined with density functional theory calculations are conducted to reveal the superior kinetics, high reversibility, and good structure stability of ZnIn2S4. Notably, the formed indium-based derivatives during cycling manifest a Na+ (de)intercalation process, thereby exciting a synergetic mechanism to stabilize electrochemical cycling. As a result, the electrochemical performances of Zn-based sulfide are significantly improved via the indium incorporation. Furthermore, a full cell based on the ZnIn2S4 anode with the superior electrochemical performance is developed. This work provides an effective tactic of heteroatom incorporation for optimizing structure as well as exciting a complementary reaction process toward developing superior anodes for high-performance alkali-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Iron sulfide (FeS) has been extensively studied as sodium‐ion battery anodes due to its high theoretical capacity (609 mAh g−1), but its large volume expansion and low electrical conductivity result in unsatisfactory cycling life and poor rate performance. Moreover, the sodium ion storage mechanism of FeS at a voltage range of 0.01–1 V involving conversion reactions and subsequent ion storage process is unclear yet. Here, the study proposes a vapor‐pressure induced synthesis route to fabricate FeS/C yolk‐shell structure that ultrathin carbon layers coat on the surface of FeS nanosheets, which can accommodate volume expansion of FeS during sodiation observed via in situ transmission electron microscope and improve its electrical conductivity. Remarkably, an in situ magnetometry reveals that vast spin‐polarized electrons can be injected into superparamagnetic Fe nanoparticles (≈3 nm) formed during conversion reaction to induce evolution of electrode magnetization between 0.01 and 1 V, during which spin‐polarized surface capacitance effect occurs at Fe/Na2S interfaces to increase extra ion storage and boost ion transport stably. Consequently, the FeS/C yolk‐shell nanosheets deliver a high reversible capacity of 664.9 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, and 300.4 mAh g−1 after 10 000 cycles at 10 A g−1 with a capacity retention of 81.1%.",

Herein, using naturally abundant and biocompatible sodium humate (SH) as the precursor, PCNSs are prepared from the laboratory scale up to the kilogram scale by a method of a facile ice‐templating‐induced puzzle coupled with a carbonization strategy. Such obtained SH‐derived PCNSs (SH‐PCNSs) possess a hierarchical porous structure dominated by mesopores having a specific surface area (~127.19 2 g−1), pore volume (~0.134 cm3 g−1), sheet‐like morphology (~2.18 nm in thickness), and nitrogen/oxygen‐containing functional groups.

It is noted that the SH‐PCNSs prepared from the kilogram‐scale production procedure possess comparable electrochemical properties. Furthermore, coupling with a LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode, the full cells deliver a high capacity of 167 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 and exhibit an outstanding energy density of 128.8 Wh kg−1, highlighting the practicability of this porous carbon nanosheets and the potential commercial opportunity of the scalable processing approach.",

However, the lack of advanced electrode materials greatly affects their applications.

In situ transmission electron microscopy images reveal the preferential expansion along the transverse direction of the nanorods upon the first discharging, which arises from the reduction of SbPO4 to Sb and the subsequent alloying of Sb as supported by in situ X-ray diffraction and selected area electron diffraction patterns. SbPO4/rGO exhibits a capacity retention of 99% after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g-1 both in half cells and in full cells. Its specific capacity at 5 A g-1 is 214 mA h g-1 in half cells or 134 mA h g-1 in full cells.

        "abstract": "Owing to their high theoretical capacity, transition-metal oxides have received a considerable amount of attention as potential anode materials in sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries. Among them, Mn3O4 has gained interest due to the low cost of raw materials and the environmental compatibility. However, during the insertion/de-insertion process, Mn3O4 suffers from particle aggregation, poor conductivity, and low-rate capability, which, in turn, limits its practical application. To overcome these obstacles, we have successfully prepared Mn3O4 nanoparticles distributed on the nitrogen (N)-doped and nitrogen, sulphur (N,S)-doped reduced graphene oxide (rGO) aerogels, respectively. The highly crystalline Mn3O4 nanoparticles, with an average size of 15–20 nm, are homogeneously dispersed on both sides of the N-rGO and N,S-rGO aerogels. The results indicate that the N-rGO and N,S-rGO aerogels could provide an efficient ion transport channel for electrolyte ion stability in the Mn3O4 electrode. The Mn3O4/N- and Mn3O4/N,S-doped rGO aerogels exhibit outstanding electrochemical performances, with a reversible specific capacity of 374 and 281 mAh g−1, respectively, after 100 cycles, with Coulombic efficiency of almost 99%. The interconnected structure of heteroatom-doped rGO with Mn3O4 nanoparticles is believed to facilitate fast ion diffusion and electron transfer by lowering the energy barrier, which favours the complete utilisation of the active material and improvement of the structure’s stability.",

The as-prepared SnO2/nitrogen-doped graphene nanohybrids exhibit enhanced electrochemical performance for sodium-ion batteries compared to SnO2/graphene nanocomposites. A systematic comparison between SnO2/nitrogen-doped graphene nanohybrids and the SnO2/graphene counterpart as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries has been conducted. The comparison is in a reasonable framework, where SnO2/nitrogen-doped graphene nanohybrids and the SnO2/graphene counterpart have the same SnO2 ratio, similar SnO2 crystallinity and particle size, close surface area and pore size. The results clearly manifest that the improved electron transfer efficiency of SnO2/nitrogen-doped graphene due to nitrogen-doping plays a more important role than the increased electro-active sites within graphene network in enhancing the electro-activity of SnO2/nitrogen-doped graphene nanohybrids compared to the SnO2/graphene counterpart. In contrast to the previous reports which often ascribe the enhanced electro-activity of nitrogen-doped graphene based composites to two nitrogen-doping effects (improving the electron transfer efficiency and increasing electro-active sites within graphene networks) in one single declaration, this work is expected to provide more specific information for understanding the effects of nitrogen-doping into graphene on improving the electrochemical performance of graphene based composites.",

The proficient cycling durability and good rate performance of SIBs are the two key parameters that determine their potential for practical use. In this study, nature-inspired three-dimensional (3D) MoS2 ultrathin marigold flower-like microstructures were prepared by a controlled hydrothermal method. These microscale flowers are constructed by arbitrarily arranged but closely interconnected two-dimensional ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets.

TEM, SEM, XRD, XPS, and Raman characterizations were used to study the morphology, crystallization, chemical compositions, and wrapping contact between MoS2 and graphene. The ultrathin nature of MoS2 in 3D MFs and graphene wrapping provide strong electrical conductive channels and conductive networks in an electrode. Benefitting from the 2 nm ultrathin crystalline MoS2 sheets, chemically bonded graphene, defect-induced sodium storage active sites, and 3D interstitial spaces, the prepared electrode exhibited an outstanding specific capacity (606 mA h g-1 at 200 mA g-1), remarkable rate performance (345 mA h g-1 at 1600 mA g-1), and long cycle life (over 100 cycles with tremendous Coulombic efficiencies beyond 100%).

The superior energy storage properties of two-dimensional(2D) carbon nanosheets can be realized by modulating the structure, but be limited by the carbon sources, making it challenging to obtain 2D structures with large surface area. In this work, a new method for forming carbon materials with high N/S doping content based on combustion activation using the dual activation effect of K2 SO4 /KNO3 is proposed. The synthesized carbon material as an anode for SIBs has a high reversible capacity of 344.44 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 . Even at the current density of 5 Ag-1 , the capacity remained at 143.08 mAh g-1 . And the ICE of sodium-ion in ether electrolytes is ≈2.5 times higher than that in ester electrolytes. The sodium storage mechanism of ether/ester-based electrolytes is further explored through ex-situ characterizations. The disparity in electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the discrepancy in kinetics, wherein ether-based electrolytes exhibit a higher rate of Na+ storage and shedding compared to ester-based electrolytes. This work suggests an effective way to develop doubly doped carbon anode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "In this work, a novel amorphous cross-linked binder is facilely prepared from abundant and low-cost sodium alginate and carboxymethyl cellulose by protonation and mixing procedures to improve electrochemical performance of silicon anodes in lithium-ion batteries. The amorphous cross-linked structure, formed by inter-molecular hydrogen bonds among functional groups in two polymers, can effectively enhance the flexibility and strength of the binder, resulting in strong adhesion between binder and other components in silicon anodes. Besides, this binder can tolerate large volume change and reduce the pulverization of silicon during the charge/discharge process. The hydrogen bonds of the binder keep the anode integrity during the volume change, leading to an excellent cycling stability and superior rate ability with a capacity of 1863 mAh g-1 at 500 mA g-1 after 150 cycles. This work provides a promising commercial binder for Si anodes.",

        "abstract": "Metal selenides, as potential alternative candidates for sodium storage, have promising applicability due to their high theoretical specific capacity. However, their huge volume change and sluggish electrode kinetics during sodium ion uptake and release processes can result in insufficient cycling life and inferior rate performance, hindering their practical application. Herein, nitrogen (N)-doped carbon-confined cobalt selenide anchored on multiwalled carbon nanotube networks (denoted as CoSe2@NC/MWCNTs) was designed and successfully built through a selenization process with ZIF-67 MOF as the template. The existence of the interconnected MWCNT network plays a crucial role in not only enhancing the electronic conductivity and ion/electron-transfer efficiency but also ensuring structural stability. Consequently, the optimized CoSe2@NC/MWCNTs composite delivers a high reversible capacity of 479.6 mA h g-1 at a current rate of 0.2 A g-1, accompanied by a 92.0% capacity retention over 100 cycles and a predominant rate performance of 227.4 mA h g-1 even under 20 A g-1 when examined as the anode in Na-ion batteries. Moreover, the kinetic behaviors were confirmed using CV profiles at various rates, as well as the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Besides, the HRTEM images clearly reveal the sodium-ion storage mechanism of the CoSe2 hybrid. These results make CoSe2@NC/MWCNTs a prospective anode material in advanced sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Cobalt diselenide (CoSe2) has drawn great concern as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries due to its considerable theoretical capacity. Nevertheless, the poor cycling stability and rate performance still impede its practical implantation. Here, CoSe2/nitrogen-doped carbon-skeleton hybrid microcubes with a TiO2 layer (denoted as TNC-CoSe2) are favorably prepared via a facile template-engaged strategy, in which a TiO2-coated Prussian blue analogue of Co3[Co(CN)6]2 is used as a new precursor accompanied with a selenization procedure. Such structures can concurrently boost ion and electron diffusion kinetics and inhibit the structural degradation during cycling through the close contact between the TiO2 layer and NC-CoSe2. Besides, this hybrid structure promotes the superior Na-ion intercalation pseudocapacitance due to the well-designed interfaces. The as-prepared TNC-CoSe2 microcubes exhibit a superior cycling capability (511 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 200 cycles) and long cycling life (456 mA h g-1 at 6.4 A g-1 for 6000 cycles with a retention of 92.7%).

Herein, we find that electrostatic modification of acidified carbon nanotubes with polyamines can introduce active sites and modulate the surface pH microenvironment, thereby developing a route to realize the in situ coaxial nanometerization of sodium titanate (nCNT@NTO). The nCNT@NTO anode material has a fast Na+ transport and the high capacitive contribution, which can deliver a high specific capacity (206.5 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1) and high rate performance (maintain 51% capacity at 10 A g-1), and the ideal cycle stability (∼93% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 5 A g-1). In addition, acrylate-rubber with high stickiness and stretchability are served as the elastic matrix both of the stretchable electrodes and quasi-solid-state electrolytes, which endows strong adhesion between electrodes and electrolytes. Thus, the accordingly assembled SSIC delivers high energy density of 8.8 mW h cm-3 (at a power density of 0.024 W cm-3), and excellent deformation stability (89% capacitance retention after 500 stretching cycles under 100% strain).",

        "abstract": "This study examines and compares the impact of various interfacial modification strategies in optimizing the contact resistance between the rigid ceramic electrolyte and cathode active material (AM) in solid‐state sodium‐ion batteries (SSBs). All the cells are fabricated using Na3.1V2P2.9Si0.1O12, Na3.456Mg0.128Zr1.872Si2.2P0.8O12, and Na as a cathode AM, solid electrolyte (SE) and anode, respectively. The AM/SE interface is modified by (1) wetting the interface with organic liquid electrolyte (LE), (2) slurry casting and sintering a thin layer of composite cathode, and (3) infiltrating AM precursors inside the porous SE structure followed by drying and sintering. Despite exhibiting a stable cyclability performance, the SSBs prepared using the LE modification and composite cathode approach possess a low AM loading of < 1 mg·cm−2. On the other hand, the SSBs with infiltrated‐cathode exhibit a superior discharge capacity of ∼ 102 mAh·g−1 at 0.2C and less than 5% capacity fading after 50 cycles at room temperature. Notably, these cells contain a high AM loading of 2.12 mg·cm−2. The microstructural analysis reveals the presence of AM particles inside the pores of the porous SE, allowing for the efficient insertion/removal of sodium ions. The porous scaffold of SE not only provides continuous sodium‐ion conduction pathways inside the cathode structure but also renders stability by accommodating stress induced by volume change during repeated cycling. The outcomes of this work demonstrate the effectiveness of the wet‐chemical infiltration technique in improving the AM loading and storage capacity performance of SSBs working at 25°C.",

However, the cycling stability and rate capability of the Bi anode are restricted by the large volume expansion and sluggish Na/K‐storage kinetics. Herein, a structural dimensionality reduction strategy is proposed and developed by converting 2D‐layer‐structured Bi into a quasi‐1D structured NiBi3 with enhanced reaction kinetics and reversibility to realize high‐rate and stable cycling performance for Na/K‐ion storage. As a proof of concept, the quasi‐1D intermetallic NiBi3 with low formation energy, metallic conductivity, and 3D Na/K‐ion diffusion pathways delivers outstanding capacity retention of 94.1% (332 mAh g−1) after 15 000 cycles for Na‐ion storage, and high initial coulombic efficiency of 93.4% with improved capacity retention for K‐ion storage. Moreover, investigations on the highly reversible Na/K‐storage reaction mechanisms and cycling‐driven morphology reconstruction further reveal the origins of the high reversibility and the accommodation to volume expansion. The finding of this work provides a new strategy for high‐performance anode design by structural dimensionality manipulation and cycling‐driven morphology reconstruction.",

        "abstract": "Na-ion batteries (NIBs) have attracted increasing attention given the fact that sodium is relatively more plentiful and affordable than lithium for sustainable and large-scale energy storage systems. However, the shortage of electrode materials with outstanding comprehensive properties has limited the practical implementations of NIBs. Among all the discovered anode materials, transition-metal sulfide has been proven as one of the most competitive and promising ones due to its excellent redox reversibility and relatively high theoretical capacity. In this study, double-morphology N-doped CoS2/multichannel carbon nanofibers composites (CoS2/MCNFs) are precisely designed, which overcome common issues such as the poor cycling life and inferior rate performance of CoS2 electrodes. The conductive 3D interconnected multichannel nanostructure of CoS2/MCNFs provides efficient buffer zones for the release of mechanical stresses from Na+ ions intercalation/deintercalation. The synergy of the diverse structural features enables a robust frame and a rapid electrochemical reaction in CoS2/MCNFs anode, resulting in an impressive long-term cycling life of 900 cycles with a capacity of 620 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 (86.4% theoretical capacity) and a surprisingly high-power output. The proposed design in this study provides a rational and novel thought for fabricating electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion hybrid supercapacitors (Na‐HSCs) by virtue of synergizing the merits of batteries and supercapacitors have attracted considerable attention for high‐energy and high‐power energy‐storage applications. Orthorhombic Nb2O5 (T‐Nb2O5) has recently been recognized as a promising anode material for Na‐HSCs due to its typical pseudocapacitive feature, but it suffers from intrinsically low electrical conductivity. Reasonably high electrochemical performance of T‐Nb2O5‐based electrodes could merely be gained to date when sufficient carbon content was introduced. In addition, flexible Na‐HSC devices have scarcely been demonstrated by far. Herein, an in situ encapsulation strategy is devised to directly grow ultrathin graphene shells over T‐Nb2O5 nanowires (denoted as Gr‐Nb2O5 composites) by plasma‐enhanced chemical vapor deposition, targeting a highly conductive anode material for Na‐HSCs. The few‐layered graphene capsules with ample topological defects would enable facile electron and Na+ ion transport, guaranteeing rapid pseudocapacitive processes at the Nb2O5/electrolyte interface. The Na‐HSC full‐cell comprising a Gr‐Nb2O5 anode and an activated carbon cathode delivers high energy/power densities (112.9 Wh kg−1/80.1 W kg−1 and 62.2 Wh kg−1/5330 W kg−1), outperforming those of recently reported Na‐HSC counterparts. Proof‐of‐concept Na‐HSC devices with favorable mechanical robustness manifest stable electrochemical performances under different bending conditions and after various bending–release cycles.",

        "abstract": "Bismuth (Bi) have been demonstrated as promising anode for Na-ion batteries (NIBs) because it has high gravimetry (386 mAh g-1) and volumetric capacity (3800 mAh cm-3). However, Bi suffers from large volume expansion during sodiation, leading to poor electrochemical performance. Construction nanostructure with sufficient void space to accommodate the volume change has been proven effective for achieving prolonged cycling stability. But the excessive void space will definitely decrease the volumetric energy density of battery. Herein, we design an optimized Bi@Void@C nanospheres (Bi@Void@C-2) with yolk-shell structure that exhibits the best cycling performance and enhanced volumetric energy density. The optimized void space could not only buffer the volume change of the Bi nanosphere, but also could keep the high volumetric energy density of battery. The Bi@Void@C-2 shows an excellent rate capacity of 173 mAh g-1 at ultra-high current density of 100 A g-1 and long-cycle life (198 mAh g-1 at 20A g-1 over 10000 cycles). The origin of the superior performance is achieved through in-depth fundamental studies during battery operation using in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and in-situ transmission electron microscope (TEM), complemented by theoretical calculations and ex-situ TEM observation. Our rational design provides insights for anode materials with large volume variation, especially for conversion type and alloying type mechanism materials for batteries (i.e. Li-ion batteries, Na-ion batteries).",

Among the various electrolytes investigated, sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI) (0.5 M) in BMPTFSI shows the best electrochemical performance with a significant improvement in cycling stability (90% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 50 mA g-1 in a half cell versus Na metal anode) compared with conventional NaClO4 (1 M) in ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate electrolytes (39% retention after 500 cycles). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies reveal that ionic liquid electrolytes are stable up to 4.8 V versus Na/Na+. When NaFSI and NaTFSI are used as conducting salts, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results prove that the cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) is composed of components resulting from the decomposition of the TFSI anion and the deposition of the BMP cation. On the other hand, the CEI layer of the electrode cycled in an electrolyte containing NaClO4 in BMPTFSI follows a different pathway of TFSI decomposition and consists mainly of sodium fluoride. Similarly, plating studies were used to understand the stability of different ionic liquids in contact with metallic sodium. It was found that the excellent capacity retention for the electrolyte consisting of NaFSI salt is related to the formation of a stable CEI and solid electrolyte interphase layers.",

        "abstract": "Sodium (Na) is the most appealing alternative to lithium as an anode material for cost‐effective, high‐energy‐density energy‐storage systems by virtue of its high theoretical capacity and abundance as a resource. However, the uncontrolled growth of Na dendrites and the limited cell cycle life impede the large‐scale practical implementation of Na‐metal batteries (SMBs) in commonly used and low‐cost carbonate electrolytes. Herein, the employment of a novel bifunctional electrospun nanofibrous separator comprising well‐ordered, uniaxially aligned arrays, and abundant sodiophilic functional groups is presented for SMBs. By tailoring the alignment degree, this unique separator integrates with the merits of serving as highly aligned ion‐redistributors to self‐orientate/homogenize the flux of Na‐ions from a chemical molecule level and physically suppressing Na dendrite puncture at a mechanical structure level. Remarkably, unprecedented long‐term cycling performances at high current densities (≥1000 h at 1 and 3 mA cm−2, ≥700 h at 5 mA cm−2) of symmetric cells are achieved in additive‐free carbonate electrolytes. Moreover, the corresponding sodium–organic battery demonstrates a high energy density and prolonged cyclability over 1000 cycles. This work opens up a new and facile avenue for the development of stable, low‐cost, and safe‐credible SMBs, which could be readily extended to other alkali‐metal batteries.",

Experimental results demonstrate that the simultaneous introduction of N and O generates a synergistic effect, increasing the surface oxygen-containing functional groups, defects, and interlayer spacing of coconut-shell-derived HC through the codoping of light elements.

However, designing ideal functional superstructures with excellent electrochemical properties is still a major challenge, and an in-depth understanding of the structure-activity relationship of electrodes remains to be achieved. To elucidate this critical issue, herein, we rationally designed and synthesized for the first time superstructured TiO2/dual-doped mesoporous carbon anodes using confined space and surface coassembly strategies. Our method primarily relied on the larger interlayer space few-layered MXene and its negatively charged surface, allowing hexamethylenetetramine intercalation and surface electrostatic adsorption. The superstructured TiO2/dual-doped mesoporous carbon was successfully assembled by the thermal decomposition of a confined carbon precursor. Subsequently, the comparison of Na+-storage properties of various anodes was carried out based on the results of structural characterization techniques and electrochemical analysis methods. The results showed that the optimized anode (N/O-C@TiO2-20) can deliver a reversible capacity of 165 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g-1, indicating excellent electrochemical properties. The enhancement can be attributed to the synergistic effect of carbon domains, defective nanocrystals, and a covalently coupled interface between TiO2 and mesoporous carbon. Our work not only offered a new strategy for the assembly and regulation of superstructures to promote the electrochemical performance but also enlightened the rational design of advanced anodes for sodium-ion battery application.",

Herein, density functional theory simulations for the first time optimize MoS2 interlayer distance between 0.80 and 1.01 nm for sodium storage. 1-Butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium acetate ([BMIm]Ac) induces cellulose oligomers to intercalate MoS2 interlayers for achieving controllable distance by changing the mass ratio of cellulose to [BMIm]Ac. Based on these findings, porous carbon loading the interlayer-expanded MoS2 allowing Na+ to insert with fast kinetics is synthesized. A carbon layer derived from [BMIm]Ac and cellulose coating the composite prevents the MoS2 from contacting electrolytes, leading to less sulfur loss for a more reversible specific capacity. Meanwhile, MoS2 and carbon have a strong interfacial connection through MoN binding, contributing to enhanced structural stability. As expected, while cycling 250 times at 0.1 A g-1 , the MoS2 -porous carbon composite displays an optimal reversible capacity at 517.79 mAh g-1 as a sodium-ion batteries anode. The cyclic test of 1.0 A g-1 also shows considerable stability (310.74 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles with 86.26% retentive capacity). This study will open up new possibilities of modifying MoS2 that serves as an applicable material as sodium-ion battery anode.",

        "abstract": "We report a facile pyrolysis process for the fabrication of a porous silicon-based anode for lithium-ion battery. Silicon flakes of 100 nm × 800 nm × 800 nm were mixed with equal weight of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) as the binder and the conductivity enhancement additive, Ketjen Black (KB), at the weight ratio of silicon–binder–KB being 70%:20%:10%, respectively. Pyrolysis was carried out at 700 °C in an inert argon environment for one hour. The process converts the binder to graphitic carbon coatings on silicon and a porous carbon structure. The process led to initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) being improved from 67% before pyrolysis to 75% after pyrolysis with the retention of 2.1 mAh/cm2 areal capacity after 100 discharge–charge cycles at 1 A/g rate. The improved ICE and cycling performance are attributed to graphitic coatings, which protect silicon from irreversible reactions with the electrolyte to form compounds such as lithium–silicon–fluoride (Li2SiF6) and the physical integrity and buffer space provided by the porous carbon structure. By eliminating the adverse effects of KB, the anode made with silicon-to-binder weight ratio of 70%:30% exhibited further improvement of the ICE to approximately 90%. This demonstrated that pyrolysis is a facile and promising one-step process for the fabrication of silicon-based anode with high ICE and long cycling life. This is especially true when the amount and choice of conductivity enhancement additive are optimized.",

        "abstract": "While the focus of research related to the design of robust, high-performance Li-ion batteries relates primarily to the synthesis of active particles, the binder plays a crucial role in stability and ensures electrode integrity during volume changes that occur with cycling. Conventional polymeric binders such as poly(vinylidene difluoride) generally do not interact with active particle surfaces and fail to accommodate large changes in particle spacing during cycling. Thus, attention is now turning toward the exploration of interfacial interactions between composite electrode constituents as a key element in ensuring electrode stability. Recently, a poly[3-(potassium-4-butanoate)thiophene] (PPBT) binder component, coupled with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) surface coating for the active material was demonstrated to enhance both electron and ion transport in magnetite-based anodes, and it was established that the PEG/PPBT approach aids in overall battery electrode performance. Herein, the PEG/PPBT system is used as a model polymeric binder for understanding cation effects in anode systems. As such, the potassium ion was replaced with sodium, lithium, hydrogen, and ammonium through ion exchange. The potassium salt exhibited the most stable electrochemical performance, which is attributed to the cation size and resultant electrode morphology that facilitates ion transport. The lithium analogue demonstrated an initial increase in capacity but was unable to maintain this performance over 100 cycles; while the sodium-based system exhibited initially lower capacity as a result of slow reaction kinetics, which increased as cycling progressed. The parent carboxylic acid polymer and its ammonium salt were notably inferior. The results exploring the effect of ion exchange creates a framework for understanding how cations associated directly with the polymer impact electrochemical performance and aid in the overall design of binders for composite Li-ion battery anodes.",

Herein, using a polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) anode as an example, we demonstrated that a moderate pyrolysis of the polymer anode could not only reduce its optical bandgap to enhance its electronic conductivity but also tune its microstructures to facilitate Na+ transfer/storage and sustain the repeated sodiation/desodiation. When used as NIBs anode with 10 wt % conductive carbon adding for preparing the electrode film, the moderate-pyrolysis PCN can promise high specific capacity (351 mAh g-1 at 0.1C), superb rate capability (151 and 95 mAh g-1 at 10C and 20C, respectively), and ultrastable cyclability (88.5% capacity retention after 6500 cycles at 2C).

The 1T MoS2 displays a large interlayer spacing around 0.95 nm, excellent hydrophilia and more electrochemically active sites along the basal plane, which contribute an efficient ion/electron transport pathway and structural stability. When employed as the anode material for sodium ion batteries, the 1T MoS2 electrodes can survive 500 full charge/discharge cycles with a minimum capacity loss of 0.40 mAh g−1 cycle−1 tested at a current density of 1.0 A g−1, and the capacity degradation is as low as 0.39 mAh g−1 cycle−1 at a current density of 2.0 A g−1.",

The charge incompatibility between MoO42- and graphene oxide with negative charged functional groups on surface can be compromised with the aid of Sn4+ cations, which renders the final formation of SnS2 and MoS2 on GS surface. This is the first report of the cohybridization of MoS2 and SnS2 with GS matrix from anionic and cationic precursors in the absence of premedication of graphene surface. When MoS2/SnS2-GS acts as anodes for lithium-ion batteries, the hybrids exhibit much better cycling stability than MoS2-GS and SnS2-GS counterparts. The compact adhesion of MoS2/SnS2 nanoparticles helps offset the undesired result of destruction of electrode materials resulting from volume expansion during repeated cycles. Furthermore, by combination with their synergetic effect on interface and the presence of discrepant asynchronous electrochemical reactions for SnS2 and MoS2, MoS2/SnS2-GS hybrids are endowed with improvement of electrochemical capabilities.

N-doped carbon layers provided a robust network for the CoS2 nanoparticles, enhancing the structural integrity and electronic conductivity of the resulting CoS2/C/C composite, which exhibited electrochemical performance superior to most existing CoS2 composites, and was one of the best among all MOF derived CoS2 anodes for LIBs and SIBs. The use of nanosized CoS2 particles reduced the diffusion length for the transfer of Li+/Na+ ions, resulting in a high specific capacity at a higher current rate. N-doped carbon layers derived from the MOF precursor and polydopamine provided an electrically conductive network between the CoS2 nanoparticles, thus preventing their aggregation and inhibiting adverse side reactions between the electrolyte and the surface of the electrode, and the high pseudocapacitive contribution resulted in the enhanced rate performance of the CoS2/C/C electrodes.",

        "abstract": "Present day lithium ion batteries face challenges regarding the sustainability, cost, and natural resource availability of their components. Sodium has been shown to be a complementary energy storage material, providing usable volumetric energy density. In designing sodium ion batteries (SIBs), hard carbon is used at the anode in place of graphite, due to the necessary micro domain structure needed to store sodium ions. Coal char is a low cost material and viable source of hard carbon. The use of coal char in SIBs also provides a high value, secondary use pathway for the abundant char component of coal.\n In this work, flash pyrolyzation is explored as a novel approach for coal char synthesis for SIB anodes using a Utah local bituminous coal. During flash pyrolyzation, char is heated in a drop-tube furnace at 1000 oC/s vs. the traditional slow pyrolyzation approach where char is heated at 20 oC/min. Flash pyrolyzed (FP) char has a surface structure that is vastly different in comparison to the slow pyrolyzed (SP) char (Figure 1.), larger d-spacing (FP d-spacing = 0.379 nm, SP d-spacing = 0.364 nm) and a smaller closed micropore diameter (FP micropore = 1.52 nm, SP micropore = 1.91 nm), as concluded from X-ray diffraction (XRD) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis, respectively.\n The SIB performance of FP char vs. SP char is tested and compared in ether-based and ester-based electrolytes. FP char performs better as a SIB anode than SP char in both electrolytes. Additionally, both char anodes achieve higher reversible capacity and better initial coulombic efficiencies (ICE) in an ether-based vs. ester-based electrolyte. When FP char is combined with an ether-based electrolyte, a 10th cycle reversible capacity of 109.4 mAh/g is achieved, whereas a SP char with an ester-based electrolyte cell has a 10th cycle reversible capacity of 72.5 mAh/g, when both cells are cycled at 50 mA/g (sodium metal half-cells). FP ether cells also perform with an initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 64%, but SP ester cells only show an ICE value of 52%. The enhanced electrochemical performance of the FP cells is attributed to differences in surface/bulk structure due to the high heating rate. The improvement in char anode performance in ether-based cells is likely due to the formation of a thinner solid-electrolyte interphase and/or improved sodiation due to an ether-based electrolyte.\n \n \n \n \n \n Figure 1\n",

Furthermore, even after 400 cycle, the composite electrode could still deliver a capacity of ~180.1 mAh g−1 at 1,000 mA g−1, corresponding to a capacity loss of 0.09% per cycle. The excellent electrochemical performance could be attributed to the synergistic effect of the highly conductive nature of the nitrogen-doped carbon-coating and WS2 nanosheets. Results showed that the WS2/NC nanosheets are promising electrode materials for SIBs application.",

Here, we propose a new strategy to enable high-capacity utilization and cycle stability of hard carbon anodes in the nonflammable phosphate electrolyte by using low-cost Na+ salt with a high molar ratio of salt/solvent combined with an solid electrolyte interphase film-forming additive. As a result, the carbon anode in the trimethyl phosphate (TMP) electrolyte with a high molar ratio of [NaClO4]/[TMP] and 5% fluoroethylene carbonate additive demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 238 mAh g-1, considerable rate capability, and long-term cycling life with 84% capacity retention over 1500 cycles.

        "abstract": "To improve the energy storage performance of carbon-based materials, considerable attention has been paid to the design and fabrication of novel carbon architectures with structural and chemical modifications. Herein, we report that hierarchical porous nitrogen-rich carbon (HPNC) nanospheres originating from acidic etching of metal carbide/carbon hybrid nanoarchitectures can be employed as high-performance anode materials for both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The structural advantages of HPNC nanospheres are that the exceptionally-high content of nitrogen (17.4 wt%) can provide abundant electroactive sites and enlarge the interlayer distance (∼3.5 Å) to improve the capacity, and the large amount of micropores and mesopores can serve as reservoirs for storing lithium/sodium ions. In LIBs, HPNC based anodes deliver a high reversible capacity of 1187 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g-1, a great rate performance of 470 mA h g-1 at 5000 mA g-1, and outstanding cycling stabilities with a capacity of 788 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 1000 mA g-1. In SIBs, HPNC based anodes exhibit a remarkable reversible capacity of 357 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 and high long-term stability with a capacity of 136 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 1000 mA g-1.",

Herein, the first prototype planar sodium‐ion microcapacitors (NIMCs) are constructed based on the interdigital microelectrodes of urchin‐like sodium titanate as faradaic anode and nanoporous activated graphene as non‐faradaic cathode along with high‐voltage ionogel electrolyte on a single flexible substrate. By effectively coupling with battery‐type anode and capacitor‐type cathode, the resultant all‐solid‐state NIMCs working at 3.5 V exhibit a high volumetric energy density of 37.1 mWh cm−3 and an ultralow self‐discharge rate of 44 h from Vmax to 0.6 Vmax, both of which surpass most reported hybrid micro‐supercapacitors. Through tuning graphene layer covered on the top surface of interdigital microelectrodes, the NIMCs unveil remarkably enhanced power density, owing to the establishment of favorable multidirectional fast ion diffusion pathways that significantly reduce the charge transfer resistance. Meanwhile, the as‐fabricated NIMCs present excellent mechanical flexibility without capacitance fade under repeated deformation, and electrochemical stability at a high temperature of 80 °C because of using nonflammable ionogel electrolyte and in‐plane geometry. Therefore, these flexible planar NIMCs with multidirectional ion diffusion pathways hold tremendous potential for microelectronics.",

Ultrathin SnS2 nanoplates with a lateral size of 5-10 nm are anchored on graphene nanosheets with a preferential (001) orientation, forming a unique plate-on-sheet structure. The electrochemical tests showed that the nanohybrid exhibits a remarkably enhanced cycling stability and rate capability compared with bare SnS2.

Nevertheless, they suffer from large volume change and from poor conductivity during prolonged cycling. Here we systematically investigate the role of different kinds of single/multi‐wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs/MWCNTs) as additives in order to stabilize copper phosphide particles (CuP2) as anode materials in sodium ion batteries (SIBs). All composites show enhancement in the overall capacity and cycling stability compared to the pristine CuP2 due to the well‐connected CNTs on and between the CuP2 particles. At a high currency density of 1 A g−1, CuP2@SWCNTs composite with 13 wt.% SWCNTs can deliver a specific capacity over 400 mAh g−1 for more than 60 cycles, much better than conventional hard carbon materials. The CNTs enhance the conductivity and reduce capacity loss caused by the volume variation of CuP2 based electrode materials. Post‐mortem analysis by scanning electron microscopy depicts a possible battery failure mechanism, whereby the solid electrolyte interface exists in the form of nanospheres distributing at the surface of the electrode. During the repeated cycling (volume change), more fractures and cracks occur resulting in continuous interfacial reactions and consumption of sodium and electrolyte.",

        "abstract": "Iron sulfides have attracted tremendous research interest for the anode of sodium-ion batteries due to their high capacity and abundant resource. However, the intrinsic pulverization and aggregation of iron sulfide electrodes induced by the conversion reaction during cycling are considered destructive and undesirable, which often impedes their capacity, rate capability, and long-term cycling stability. Herein, an interesting pulverization phenomenon of ultrathin carbon-coated Fe1- xS nanoplates (Fe1- xS@C) is observed during the first discharge process of sodium-ion batteries, which leads to the formation of Fe1- xS nanoparticles with quantum size (≈5 nm) tightly embedded in the carbon matrix. Surprisingly, no discernible aggregation phenomenon can be detected in subsequent cycles. In/ex situ experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrate that ultrafine pulverization can confer several advantages, including sustaining reversible conversion reactions, reducing the adsorption energies, and diffusion energy barriers of sodium atoms, and preventing the aggregation of Fe1- xS particles by strengthening the adsorption between pulverized Fe1- xS nanoparticles and carbon. As a result, benefiting from the unique ultrafine pulverization, the Fe1- xS@C anode simultaneously exhibits high reversible capacity (610 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1), superior rate capability (427.9 mAh g-1 at 20 A g-1), and ultralong cycling stability (377.9 mAh g-1 after 2500 cycles at 20 A g-1).",

Introducing sacrificial cathode presodiation agents, particularly those that own potential anionic oxidation activity with a high theoretical capacity, can provide additional sodium sources for compensating Na loss. Herein, Ni atoms are precisely implanted at the Na sites within Na2O framework, obtaining a (Na0.89Ni0.05□0.06)2O (Ni-Na2O) presodiation agent. The synergistic interaction between Na vacancies and Ni catalyst effectively tunes the band structure, forming moderate Ni-O covalent bonds, activating the oxidation activity of oxygen anion, reducing the decomposition overpotential to 2.8 V (vs Na/Na+), and achieving a high presodiation capacity of 710 mAh/g≈Na2O (Na2O decomposition rate >80%). Incorporating currently-modified presodiation agent with Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na2/3Ni2/3Mn1/3O2 cathodes, the energy density of corresponding Na-ion full-cells presents an essential improvement of 23.9% and 19.3%, respectively.

        "abstract": "Sodium metal is regarded as an optimal anode material for high‐energy‐density sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, during the processes of sodium deposition and stripping, the failure of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film leads to the continuous accumulation of inactive sodium, thereby compromising the cycling reversibility of the battery. Here, a novel metal fluoride heterointerface layer is generated and constructed through in situ manipulation of the continuous reaction between TiF4 and metal Na. The reconstructed NaF/TiF3 interface layer, which tightly anchors the sodium metal, effectively suppresses the formation of sodium dendrites during the charge‐discharge process. The highly sodium‐philic TiF3 component exhibits strong binding with Na ions, while NaF reduces the Na+ diffusion energy barrier, significantly enhancing the reaction kinetics. Due to the successful artificial construction of this interface layer, the Na/TiF4 composite electrode demonstrates an exceptional ultra‐long cycling stability of 2370 h in symmetric cells (0.5 mAh cm−2). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further validate the functionality of each component in the Na/TiF4 protective layer. When paired with NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode in a pouch cell, it exhibits stability up to 2000 cycles at current densities of 2 C and 4 C, with a maximum energy density output of 483.1 Wh kg−1 (power density: 320.8 W kg−1).",

These would have the potential of having disruptive effects in the world transition towards a less carbon-dependent energy economy through transport, both by electrification and renewable energy integration. Aside from controversial debates on lithium supply, the development of new sustainable battery chemistries based on abundant elements is appealing, especially for large-scale stationary applications. Interesting alternatives are to use sodium, magnesium or calcium instead of lithium. While for the Na-ion case, fast progresses are expected as a result of chemical similarities with lithium and the cumulated Li-ion battery know-how over the years, for Ca and Mg the situation is radically different. On the one hand, the possibility to use Ca or Mg metal anodes would bring a breakthrough in terms of energy density; on the other, development of suitable electrolytes and cathodes with efficient multivalent ion migration are bottlenecks to overcome.

        "abstract": "Pyrite (FeS2) has been considered as one of the most potential anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) due to its low cost, environmentally friendly features and high theoretical capacity. However, the huge volume changes during a charge/discharge process and poor conductivity of FeS2 hindered its practical applications. Herein, we propose a facile scalable approach to prepare nanostructured FeS2 embedded in an N-doped carbon nanosheet composite (FeS2/CNS) via a combined template method and a solid state sulfuration method. N-Doped carbon nanosheets are believed to alleviate the volume variation and enhance the conductivity of an electrode, and the nanoscale particle size with an average diameter of 50-80 nm can shorten the ion-diffusion paths during a sodiation/desodiation process. As a result, the FeS2/CNS electrode exhibits high specific capacity (812 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), long cycling life (77.2% capacity retention after 350 cycles at 1 A g-1) and excellent rate capability (400 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1) when tested as an anode material for SIBs.

        "abstract": "Phosphorus represents a promising anode material for sodium ion batteries owing to its extremely high theoretical capacity. Recent in situ transmission electron microscopy studies evidenced anisotropic swelling in sodiated black phosphorus, which may find an origin from the two intrinsic anisotropic properties inherent to the layered structure of black phosphorus: sodium diffusional directionality and insertion strain anisotropy. To understand the morphological evolution and stress generation in sodiated black phosphorus, we develop a chemo-mechanical model by incorporating the intrinsic anisotropic properties into the large elasto-plastic deformation. Our modeling results reveal that the apparent morphological evolution in sodiated black phosphorus is critically controlled by the coupled effect of the two intrinsic anisotropic properties. In particular, sodium diffusional directionality generates sharp interphases along the [010] and [001] directions, which constrain anisotropic development of the insertion strain. The coupled effect renders distinctive stress-generation and fracture mechanisms when sodiation starts from different crystal facets. In addition to providing a powerful modeling framework for sodiation and lithiation of layered structures, our findings shed significant light on the sodiation-induced chemo-mechanical degradation of black phosphorus as a promising anode for the next-generation sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The kinetics incompatibility between battery-type anode and capacitive-type cathode for sodium ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) seriously hinders their overall performance output. Herein, we construct a SIHCs device by coupling with quantum grade vanadium nitride (VN) nanodots anchored in one-dimensional N/F co-doped carbon nanofiber cages hybrids (VNQDs@PCNFs-N/F) as the freestanding anode and the corresponding activated N/F co-doped carbon nanofiber cages (APCNFs-N/F) as cathode. The strong coupling of VN quantum dots with N/F co-doped 1D conductive carbon cages effectively facilitates the ion/electron transport and intercalation-conversion-deintercalation reactions, ensuring fast sodium storage to surmount aforesaid kinetics incompatibility. Additionally, density functional theory calculations cogently manifest that the abundant active sites in the VNQDs@PCNFs-N/F configuration boost the Na+ adsorption/reaction activity well which will promote both \"intrinsic\" and \"extrinsic\" pseudocapacitance and further improve anode kinetics. Consequently, the assembled SIHCs device can achieve high energy densities of 157.1 and 95.0 Wh kg-1 at power densities of 198.8 and 9100.5 W kg-1, respectively, with an ultralong cycling life over 8000 cycles.

Mesoporous carbons, either as active materials or as hosts for guest active nanoparticles, are considered as promising electrode materials. However, addressing the issues of their short lifespan resulting from volume variation and the low coulombic efficiency caused by large surface area via a facile porous structure design still remains a challenge. Herein, a versatile phosphorus‐doped mesoporous carbon (PMC) armed is developed by graphene aerogel (GA) (GA@PMC) for hosting Na‐storage active nanoparticles. As a case study, FeSe2 nanoparticles are selectively supported onto this GA@PMC matrix, creating the FeSe2/GA@PMC composite. When employed in typical Na‐storage devices, such as Na‐ion batteries, Na‐ion hybrid capacitors, and Na‐ion based dual‐ion batteries, the FeSe2/GA@PMC electrode consistently demonstrates superior electrochemical performance. In such GA@PMC, the conformal GA can improve the entire conductivity while decreasing the specific surface area that is directly contacting with electrolyte. The interconnected macroporous structure can not only promote the diffusion of Na+ but also buffers the volume change of the guest active nanoparticles. This bespoke carbon platform synergistically endows the electrode material with enhanced rate capability, cyclic stability, and coulombic efficiency, which are being expected in advanced Na‐storage devices.",

Ag coated Zn foil with enhanced sodiophilicity, rapid Na+ transfer kinetics and superior electronic conductivity guarantee the homogenized Na+ ion and electric field distribution. This enables remarkably low overpotentials and uniform Na plating/stripping behavior with ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency of 99.9% during 500 cycles.

        "abstract": "Fe-based sulfides are a promising type of anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high theoretical capacities and affordability. However, these materials often suffer from issues such as capacity deterioration and poor conductivity during practical application. To address these challenges, an N-doped Fe7S8 anode with an N, S co-doped porous carbon framework (PPF-800) was synthesized using a template-assisted method. When serving as an anode for SIBs, it delivers a robust and ultrafast sodium storage performance, with a discharge capacity of 489 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 5 A g−1 and 371 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 30 A g−1 in the ether-based electrolyte. This impressive performance is attributed to the combined influence of heteroatomic doping and adjustable interface engineering. The N, S co-doped carbon framework embedded with Fe7S8 nanoparticles effectively addresses the issues of volumetric expansion, reduces the impact of sodium polysulfides, improves intrinsic conductivity, and stimulates the dominant pseudocapacitive contribution (90.3% at 2 mV s−1). Moreover, the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film by the effect of uniform pore structure in ether-based electrolyte produces a lower transfer resistance during the charge–discharge process, thereby boosting the rate performance of the electrode material. This work expands a facile strategy to optimize the electrochemical performance of other metal sulfides.",

Here, we propose sieving carbons, featuring highly tunable nanopores with tightened pore entrances, as high-energy anodes with extensible and reversible low-potential plateaus (<0.1 V). It is shown that the tightened pore entrance blocks the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase inside the nanopores and enables sodium clustering to produce the plateau. Theoretical and spectroscopic studies also show that creating a larger area of sodiophilic pore surface leads to an almost linearly increased number of sodium clusters, and controlling the pore body diameter guarantees the reversibility of sodium cluster formation, producing a sieving carbon anode with a record-high plateau capacity of 400 mAh g–1. More excitingly, this approach to preparing sieving carbons has the potential to be scalable for modifying different commercial porous carbons.",

        "abstract": "A sulfur doping strategy has been frequently used to improve the sodium storage specific capacity and rate capacity of hard carbon. However, some hard carbon materials have difficulty in preventing the shuttling effect of electrochemical products of sulfur molecules stored in the porous structure of hard carbon, resulting in the poor cycling stability of electrode materials. Here, a multifunctional coating is introduced to comprehensively improve the sodium storage performance of a sulfur-containing carbon-based anode. The physical barrier effect and chemical anchoring effect contributed by the abundant C-S/C-N polarized covalent bond of the N, S-codoped coating (NSC) combine to protect SGCS@NSC from the shuttling effect of soluble polysulfide intermediates. Additionally, the NSC layer can encapsulate the highly dispersed carbon spheres inside a cross-linked three-dimensional conductive network, improving the electrochemical kinetic of the SGCS@NSC electrode. Benefiting from the multifunctional coating, SGCS@NSC exhibits a high capacity of 609 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 249 mAh g−1 at 6.4 A g−1. Furthermore, the capacity retention of SGCS@NSC is 17.6% higher than that of the uncoated one after 200 cycles at 0.5 A g−1.",

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) antimonene is a promising anode material in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of its high theoretical capacity of 660 mAh g-1 and enlarged surface active sites. However, its Na storage properties and sodiation/desodiation mechanism have not been fully explored. Herein, we propose the sodiation/desodiation reaction mechanism of 2D few-layer antimonene (FLA) based on results acquired by in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, ex situ selected-area electron diffraction, and theoretical simulations. Our study shows that the FLA undergoes anisotropic volume expansion along the a/b plane and exhibits reversible crystalline phase evolution (Sb ⇋ NaSb ⇋ Na3Sb) during cycling. Density-functional theory calculations demonstrate that the FLA has a small Na-ion diffusion barrier of 0.14 eV. The FLA delivers a larger capacity of 642 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C (1 C = 660 mA g-1) and a high rate capability of 429 mAh g-1 at 5 C and maintains a stable capacity of 620 mA g-1 at 0.5 C with 99.7% capacity retention from the 10th to the 150th cycle. Considering the 660 mAh g-1 theoretical capacity of Sb, the electrochemical utilization of Sb atoms of FLA is as high as 93.9% at a rate of 0.5 C for over 150 cycles, which is the highest capacity and Sb utilization ratio reported so far. Our study discloses the Na storage mechanism of 2D FLA, boosting promising applications of 2D materials for advanced SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Pillared MXenes with large interlayer spacing have shown great potential as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). To better understand the underlying mechanism of the pillar effect in enhancing the electrochemical performance, first-principles calculations were used to investigate the adsorption and diffusion of Na in MXenes (Ti2CO2 and Ti3C2O2), as well as the mechanical properties of the system under different MXenes layer spacings. The results showed that when the MXene layer spacing was ∼4 Å, the strongest adsorption of Na on MXenes was achieved due to the interlayer synergy effect. However, when the MXene layer spacing was greater than 5 Å, double Na-atomic layer adsorption would be formed, which increased the Na storage capacity. Interestingly, the diffusion of Na was not only affected by the interlayer spacing of MXenes, but also by the interlayer stacking mode of MXenes. Moreover, it was found that when the MXene layer spacing was more than 8 Å, the sodium storage properties basically did not change significantly. The optimal layer spacing for Ti2CO2 and Ti3C2O2 was predicted to be 7 and 6 Å, respectively. This work provides valuable theoretical guidance for developing high-performance anode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon with different microstructures and physicochemical properties can be obtained based on the precursor used, and these properties have a direct impact on the electrochemical performance. Herein, two different precursors from a single source of waste cotton textiles have been prepared to be either cotton snippets retaining the original fiber structure of cotton or a microfibrillated cellulose, which has a very different morphology and surface area. Both the cotton snippet (CS) and the microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) have been carbonized to prepare hard carbons MFC-C and CS-C, and their electrochemical performance is evaluated in sodium-ion batteries (NIBs). Physicochemical properties in terms of a higher interlayer spacing of 3.71 Å and a high defect ratio (ID/IG) of 1.10 resulted in CS-C having a relatively higher specific capacity of 240 mAh g-1 in comparison to 199 mAh g-1 in MFC-C when cycled at 50 mA g-1. In addition, ex-situ MAS (magic angle spinning) NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer of CS-C revealed a lesser amount of conductive SEI layer on its surface compared to MFC-C, mainly composed of NaF and an additional FSI-derived Na complex, suggested to be Na2 [SO3-N-SO2F]). In contrast, MFC-C revealed a greater amount of SEI-related compounds, which is interpreted as a thicker SEI layer resulting in a long Na+ diffusion pathway and slower Na+ reaction kinetics. This study provides insight into the effect of microstructural differences arising from different cellulose precursors on the electrochemical performance, thereby aiding in the fabrication and optimization of hard carbon anodes for sodium-ion batteries.",

Compared with conventional monovalent ion batteries like lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries, multivalent ion batteries have attracted extensive attention owing to their high energy densities. Here, we systematically explore the interactions between Mg atoms and α-beryllene monolayers by means of density functional theory calculations. Mg atoms can be adsorbed stably on α-beryllene monolayers with the adsorption energy of -0.24 eV. The low diffusion energy barriers (0.099/0.101 eV) indicate the rapid mobility of Mg during the charge/discharge process. Moreover, the α-beryllene monolayer exhibits an ultra-high theoretical specific capacity of 5956 mA h g-1 for Mg, a low average open-circuit voltage of 0.24 V, and a tiny volume change of -1.08%. Finally, the constructed h-BN/α-beryllene heterostructure shows that h-BN can serve as a protective cover to preserve pristine α-beryllene in respect of metallicity, Mg adsorption capability, and fast ionic mobility. The above mentioned outstanding results make α-beryllene a promising anode material for magnesium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Iron/manganese‐based layered transition metal oxides have risen to prominence as prospective cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their abundant resources and high theoretical specific capacities, yet they still suffer from rapid capacity fading. Herein, a dual‐strategy is developed to boost the Na‐storage performance of the Fe/Mn‐based layered oxide cathode by copper (Cu) doping and nanoengineering. The P2‐Na0.76Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48O2 cathode material synthesized by electrospinning exhibits the pearl necklace‐like hierarchical nanostructures assembled by nanograins with sizes of 50–150 nm. The synergistic effects of Cu doping and nanotechnology enable high Na+ coefficients and low ionic migration energy barrier, as well as highly reversible structure evolution and Cu/Fe/Mn valence variation upon repeated sodium insertion/extraction; thus, the P2‐Na0.76Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48O2 nano‐necklaces yield fabulous rate capability (125.4 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C with 56.5 mA h g−1 at 20 C) and excellent cyclic stability (≈79% capacity retention after 300 cycles). Additionally, a promising energy density of 177.4 Wh kg−1 is demonstrated in a prototype soft‐package Na‐ion full battery constructed by the tailored nano‐necklaces cathode and hard carbon anode. This work symbolizes a step forward in the development of Fe/Mn‐based layered oxides as high‐performance cathodes for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal oxide magnetite (Fe3O4) is recognized as a potential anode material for lithium-ion batteries owing to its high theoretical specific capacity, modest voltage output, and eco-friendly character. It is a challenging task to engineer high-performance composite materials by effectively dispersing Fe3O4 crystals with limited sizes in a well-designed supporting framework following sustainable approaches. In this work, the naturally abundant plant products sodium lignosulfonate (Lig) and sodium cellulose (CMC) were selected to coprecipitate with Fe3+ ions under mild hydrothermal conditions. The Fe-Lig/CMC intermediate sediment with an optimized microstructure can be directly converted to the Lig/CMC-derived carbon matrix-supported Fe3O4 nanocomposite sample (Fe3O4@LigC/CC). Compared with the controlled Fe3O4@LigC material, the Fe3O4@LigC/CC nanocomposite provides superior electrochemical performance in the anode, which has inspiring specific capacities of 820.6 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles under a current rate of 100 mA·g−1 and 750.5 mAh g−1 after 250 cycles, as well as more exciting rate capabilities. The biomimetic sample design and synthesis protocol closely follow the criteria of green chemistry and can be further developed in wider scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Improving the fast-charging capabilities and energy storage capacity of electric vehicles presents a feasible strategy for mitigating the prevalent concern of range anxiety in the market. Nanostructure electrode materials play a crucial role in this process. However, the current method of preparation is arduous and yields restricted quantities. In view of this, we have devised an innovative approach that provides convenience and efficacy, facilitating the large-scale synthesis of CoS2 nanoparticles, which exhibited exceptional performance. When the current density was 1000 mA g-1, the discharging capacity reached 760 mAh g-1 after 400 cycles. Remarkably, even at an increased current density of 5000 mA g-1, the discharging capacity of CoS2 remained at 685.5 mAh g-1. The ultra-high performance could be attributed to the specific surface area, which minimized the diffusion distance of sodium-ions during the charging and discharging processes and mitigated the extent of structural damage. Our straightforward preparation techniques facilitate the mass production and present a novel approach for the development of cost-effective and high-performing anode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-metal batteries, heralded for high energy density and cost-effectiveness, are compromised by an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and dendrite formation, which hinder practical applications. Herein, a zirconium-based metal-organic framework nanostructure coating (ZMOF-NSC) was constructed in a low-loss, flexible manner. Comprehensive studies show that ZMOF-NSC, with its periodically ordered nanochannels and organized pore structures, enhances ion transport and decreases the Na+ migration energy barrier, thus ensuring uniform ion flux and achieving uniform spherical deposition. Additionally, ZMOF-NSC facilitates partial desolvation, catalyzing the formation of an inorganic-rich, dual-layered SEI that effectively protects the anode and suppresses dendrite formation. Consequently, the ZMOF-NSC@Na symmetric battery exhibits an impressive lifespan of over 2500 h, demonstrating extended operational longevity. The Na3V2(PO4)3∥ZMOF-NSC@Na batteries demonstrate exceptional cycling stability with 81% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 10 C, maintaining stability over 3000 cycles at 20 C. Moreover, the NVP∥ZMOF-NSC@Na battery achieves an energy density of 370 Wh kg-1 and a power density of 10,484 W kg-1, indicating superior durability and performance. This significant finding highlights the significant potential of structured MOFs to induce a dual-layered SEI, advancing the commercialization of durable, dendrite-free sodium metal batteries. The precise design of self-assembled pore structures and surface active sites in MOFs demonstrates significant potential in advancing the commercialization of durable, dendrite-free electrodes of metal-based rechargeable batteries.",

We report a sodium storage mechanism and properties of a new anode material, digenite Cu1.8S, based on its crystallographic study. It is revealed that copper sulfides (Cu xS) can have metal-rich formulas ( x ≥ 1.6), due to the unique oxidation state of +1 found in group 11 elements. These phases enable the unit cell to consist of all strong Cu-S bonds and no direct S-S bonds, which are vulnerable to external stress/strain that could result in bond cleavage as well as decomposition. Because of its structural rigidness, the Cu1.8S shows an intercalation/deintercalation reaction mechanism even in a low potential window of 0.1-2.2 V versus Na/Na+ without irreversible phase transformation, which most of the metal sulfides experience through a conversion reaction mechanism. It uptakes, on average, 1.4 Na+ ions per unit cell (∼250 mAh g-1) and exhibits ∼100% retention over 1000 cycles at 2C in a tuned voltage range of 0.5-2.2 V through an overall solid solution reaction with negligible phase separation.",

Here, the indium is first introduced into Cu2Se to achieve the formation of CuInSe2. Next, an ion extraction strategy is employed to fabricate Cu0.54In1.15Se2 enriched with ordered vacancies by spontaneous formation of defect pairs. Such ordered defects, compared with unordered ones, can serve as myriad sodium ion micropumps evenly distributing in crystalline host to homogenize the adsorbed Na+ and the generated volumetric stress during the electrochemistry. Furthermore, Cu0.54In1.15Se2 is indeed proved by the calculations to exhibit smaller volumetric variation than the counterpart with unordered vacancies. Thanks to the distinct ordered vacancy structure, the material exhibits a highly reversible capacity of 428 mAh g−1 at 1 C and a high‐rate stability of 311.7 mAh g−1 at 10 C after 5000 cycles when employed as an anode material for Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs).

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are currently the most promising candidates for large-scale energy storage devices owing to their low cost and abundant resources. Titanium-based layered oxides have attracted widespread attention as promising anode materials due to delivering a safe potential of about 0.7 V (vs Na+/Na) and a small volume contraction during cycles; P2-type Ti-based layered oxides are typically reported, due to the challenging synthesis of the O3-type counterpart resulting from the high percentage of unstable Ti3+. Herein, we report an anomalous O3-Na2/3Ni1/3Ti2/3O2 layered oxide as an ultrastable and high-rate anode material for SIBs. The anode material delivers a reversible capacity of 112 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles at 0.1 C, a good capacity retention rate of 91% after 1400 cycles at 2 C, and, in particular, a capacity of 52 mA h g-1 even at a high rate of 20 C (1780 mA g-1). Furthermore, the in situ X-ray diffraction monitoring reveals no phase transitions and almost zero strain both underlie the good long-cycle stability. The measured high apparent Na+ diffusion coefficient (2.06 × 10-10 cm2 s-1) and the low migration energy barrier (0.59 eV) from density functional theory calculations are responsible for the superior rate capability. Our results promise advanced high-performance O3-type Ti-based layered oxides as promising anode materials toward application for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Exploring advanced anode materials with excellent electrochemical performance for rechargeable batteries, including lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs), has attracted great attention. However, low electronic conductivity, severe particle agglomeration and lack of effective synthesis methods have still greatly hampered their rapid development. Herein, we initially fabricate a novel VSe1.5/CNF composite through a facile electrospinning method followed by selenization. The electrochemical measurements show that VSe1.5/CNFs can enable the rapid and durable storage of Li+, Na+, and K+ ions. When used as an anode material for LIBs, the VSe1.5/CNF composite delivers a high capacity of 932 mA h g-1 after 400 cycles at a high current density of 1 A g-1. In addition, for SIBs, the VSe1.5/CNF composite manifests a high reversible capacity of 668 mA h g-1 after 50 cycles and an excellent capacity of 265 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1 even after an ultra-long 6000 cycles. This is one of the best performances of vanadium-based anode materials for SIBs reported so far. Most remarkably, the VSe1.5/CNF composite also demonstrates a satisfactory reversible K+ storage performance. The simple synthetic route and excellent ion storage properties make the VSe1.5/CNF composite a great prospect for application as an anode material for alkali metal ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Low Na+ and electron diffusion kinetics severely restrain the rate capability of MoS2 as anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Slow phase transitions between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S as well as the volume change during cycling, induce a poor cycling stability. Herein, an original Fe single atom doped MoS2 hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) is designed for the first time to address the above challenges. The Fe single atom in MoS2 promotes the electron transfer, companying with shortened charge diffusion path from unique HoMS, thereby achieving excellent rate capability. The strong adsorption with Na+ and self-catalysis of Fe single atom facilitates the reversible conversion between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S. Moreover, the buffering effect of HoMS on volume change during cycling improves the cyclic stability. Consequently, the Fe single atom doped MoS2 quadruple-shelled sphere exhibits a high specific capacity of 213.3 mAh g-1 at an ultrahigh current density of 30 A g-1, which is superior to previously-reported results. Even at 5 A g-1, 259.4 mAh g-1 (83.68 %) was reserved after 500 cycles. Such elaborate catalytic site decorated HoMS is also promising to realize other \"fast-charging\" high-energy-density rechargeable batteries.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal selenides (TMSs) are suitable for SIBs and PIBs owing to their satisfactory theoretical capacity and superior electrical conductivity. However, the large radius of Na+/K+ easily leads to sluggish kinetics and poor conductivity, which hinder the development of SIBs and PIBs. Structure design is an effective method to solve these obstacles. In this study, Co2+ ions combined with glycerol molecules to form self-assembled nanospheres at first, and then they were in situ converted into CoSe2 nanoparticles embedded in a carbon matrix during the selenization process. This structure has three-dimensional ion diffusion channels that can effectively hamper the aggregation of metal compound nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the CoSe2/C of the yolk-shell structure and a large number of pores help alleviate volume expansion and facilitate electrolyte wettability. These structural advantages of CoSe2/C endow it with remarkable electrochemical performances for full/half SIBs and full/half PIBs. The obtained CoSe2/C exhibits superior stability and excellent performance (312.1 mA h g-1 at 4 A g-1 after 1600 cycles) for SIBs. When it is used as an anode material for PIBs, 369.2 mA h g-1 can be retained after 200 cycles at 50 mA g-1 and 248.1 mA h g-1 can be retained after 200 cycles at 500 mA g-1; in addition, CoSe2/C also shows superior rate capacity (186.4 mA h g-1 at 1000 mA g-1). A series of ex situ XRD measurements were adapted to explore the possible conversion mechanism of CoSe2/C as the anode for PIBs. It is worth noting that the full-cell of CoSe2/C//Na3V2(PO4)3@rGO for SIBs and the full-cell of CoSe2/C//PTCDA-450 for PIBs were successfully assembled. The relationship between the structure and performance of CoSe2/C was investigated through density functional theory (DFT).",

For SIBs, the as-developed MoS2-rGO/HCS can also maintain a reversible capacity of 443 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 500 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the 3D porous structures, in which the few-layer MoS2 nanosheets with expanded interlayers can provide shortened ion diffusion paths and improved Li+/Na+ diffusion mobility, and the hollow porous carbon spheres and the outside graphene network are able to improve the conductivity and maintain the structural integrity.",

So-called hard-carbons are promising anode active materials for SIBs because of their easy synthesis, high capacity, and high cycling stability.2 Major challenges are the high irreversible capacity in the first cycle and the stability of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI).3\n -\n 4\n \n Online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OEMS) is a powerful tool for identifying and quantifying evolved gasses during SEI formation, giving insight into the mechanism of SEI formation. For LIB research, our group had developed a two-compartment OEMS cell design that enables the investigation of evolved gases from one of the electrodes of a battery cell without interference from the gases evolved from the other electrode, which is particularly useful for the mechanistic study of electrolyte additives or impurities without influences of the counter electrode.5–8\n \n In this study, we investigate the gas evolution during the first lithiation/delithiation cycles of a hard-carbon anode active material using our existing two-compartment cell design. This will then be compared to the gas evolution during the first sodiation/desodiation cycles of the same hard-carbon material using a newly developed two-compartment OEMS-cell design for the study of sodium-ion batteries, which is based on a gas impermeable solid electrolyte separator composed of sodium ion conducting β-alumina. We compare the quantities of evolved gasses and look at the onset potentials of gas evolution during the first alkaline metal insertion. On the basis of gassing and impedance data,9,10 the differences in SEI formation and its properties will be discussed.\n Acknowledgments: We gratefully acknowledge funding by the BMBF (Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany) for its financial support under the auspices of the ExZellTUM III project, grant number 03XP0255\n References: \n \n Pan, Y.-S.

        "title": "Facile Fabrication of Large-Area CuO Flakes for Sodium-Ion Energy Storage Applications",
        "abstract": "CuO is recognized as a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries because of its impressive theoretical capacity of 674 mAh g−1, derived from its multiple electron transfer capabilities. However, its practical application is hindered by slow reaction kinetics and rapid capacity loss caused by side reactions during discharge/charge cycles. In this work, we introduce an innovative approach to fabricating large-area CuO and CuO@Al2O3 flakes through a combination of magnetron sputtering, thermal oxidation, and atomic layer deposition techniques. The resultant 2D CuO flakes demonstrate excellent electrochemical properties with a high initial reversible specific capacity of 487 mAh g−1 and good cycling stability, which are attributable to their unique architectures and superior structural durability. Furthermore, when these CuO flakes are coated with an ultrathin Al2O3 layer, the integration of the 2D structures with outer nanocoating leads to significantly enhanced electrochemical properties. Notably, even after 70 rate testing cycles, the CuO@Al2O3 materials maintain a high capacity of 525 mAh g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1. Remarkably, at a higher current density of 2000 mA g−1, these materials still achieve a capacity of 220 mAh g−1. Moreover, after 200 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g−1, a high charge capacity of 319 mAh g−1 is sustained. In addition, a full cell consisting of a CuO@Al2O3 anode and a NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode is investigated, showcasing remarkable cycling performance. Our findings underscore the potential of these innovative flake-like architectures as electrode materials in high-performance sodium-ion batteries, paving the way for advancements in energy storage technologies.",

One of the boosters for accelerating the practical application of sodium-ion batteries is the innovation in anode materials. This study focuses on developing a high-performance hard carbon anode material derived from hydroxymethylfurfural, produced from carbohydrates, using a straightforward thermal condensation method. The process results in a unique pseudo-graphitic material with abundant microporosity. Electrochemical evaluations demonstrate excellent sodium storage performance by maintaining the plateau capacity even at higher current densities. This translates to a promising energy density when coupled with the cathode material. However, we also discuss the influence of electrolyte composition on the performance of the hydroxymethylfurfural-derived hard carbon, emphasizing the critical role of electrolyte optimization for the development of efficient and sustainable carbonaceous anode materials for next-generation sodium-based batteries.",

        "abstract": "Novel nitrogen doped (N-doped) hollow beaded structural composite carbon nanofibers are successfully applied for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Tungsten disulfide (WS2 ) nanosheets are confined, through synergistic anchoring, on the surface and inside of hollow beaded carbon nanofibers (HB CNFs) via a hydrothermal reaction method to construct the hierarchical structure HB WS2 @CNFs. Benefiting from this unique advantage, HB WS2 @CNFs exhibits remarkable lithium-storage performance in terms of high rate capability (≈351 mAh g-1 at 2 A g-1 ) and stable long-term cycle (≈446 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 100 cycles). Moreover, as an anode material for SIBs, HB WS2 @CNFs obtains excellent long cycle life and rate performance. During the charging/discharging process, the evolution of morphology and composition of the composite are analyzed by a set of ex situ methods. This synergistic anchoring effect between WS2 nanosheets and HB CNFs is capable of effectively restraining volume expansion from the metal ions intercalation/deintercalation process and improving the cycling stability and rate performance in LIBs and SIBs.",

        "abstract": "As the most promising candidate for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the electrochemical performance of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is highly dependent on the electrode materials. Copper selenides have established themselves as potential anode materials for SIBs due to their high theoretical capacity and good conductivity. However, the poor rate performance and fast capacity fading are the major challenges to their practical application in SIBs. Herein, single-crystalline CuSe2 nanocubes (CuSe2 NCs) are successfully synthesized via a solvothermal method. As an anode of SIBs, the CuSe2 NCs render an almost 100% initial Coulombic efficiency, an outstanding long cycle life, e.g., 380 mA h g-1 after 1700 cycles at 10 A g-1, and an unprecedented rate performance of 344 mA h g-1 at 50 A g-1. Ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns reveal the crystalline transformation of energy-storage materials, and the density functional theory (DFT) conclusion suggests that fast and stable ion diffusion kinetics enhances their electrochemical performance upon sodiation/desodiaton. The investigation into the mechanism provides a theoretical basis for subsequent practical applications.",

The utilization of carbonaceous materials as a buffer layer has been considered an effective approach to alleviate rapid capacity fading. Herein, the antimony/nitrogen-doping porous carbon (Sb/NPC) composite with polyaniline nanosheets as a carbon source has been successfully achieved. In addition, our strategy involves three processes, a tunable organic polyreaction, a thermal annealing process, and a cost-effective reduction reaction. The as-prepared Sb/NPC electrode demonstrates a great reversible capacity of 529.6 mA h g-1 and an outstanding cycling stability with 97.2% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 100 mA g-1. Even at 1600 mA g-1, a superior rate capacity of 357 mA h g-1 can be retained. Those remarkable electrochemical performances can be ascribed to the introduction of a hierarchical porous NPC material to which tiny Sb nanoparticles of about 30 nm were well-wrapped to buffer volume expansion and improve conductivity.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are considered one of the most promising large‐scale and low‐cost energy storage systems due to the abundance and low price of sodium. Herein, hard carbons from a sustainable biomass feedstock (vine shoots) were synthesized via a simple two‐step carbonization process at different highest temperatures to be used as anodes in SIBs. The hard carbon produced at 1200 °C delivered the highest reversible capacity (270 mAh g–1 at 0.03 A g–1, with an acceptable initial coulombic efficiency of 71%) since a suitable balance between the pseudographitic domains growth and the retention of microporosity, defects, and functional groups was achieved. A prominent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 97% over 315 cycles was also attained. Comprehensive characterization unraveled a three‐stage sodium storage mechanism based on adsorption, intercalation, and filling of pores. A remarkable specific capacity underestimation of up to 38% was also found when a two‐electrode half‐cell configuration was employed to measure the rate performance. To avoid this systematic error caused by the counter/reference electrode polarization, we strongly recommend the use of a three‐electrode setup or a full‐cell configuration to correctly evaluate the anode response at moderate and high current rates.",

        "title": "Copper Vanadium Sulfide as an Anode Material in Sodium-Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "As the modern world is moving from non-renewable energy sources to renewable sources, such as wind and solar, energy storage devices are necessary in more than just portable electronics. Large-scale, stationary energy storage is required to combat the intermittent supply of renewable energy. Li-ion batteries, which are the current state of art in energy storage devices, will not be viable in the long term for such an application as it requires a large quantity of scarce raw materials (e.g. Li, Co). To reduce the cost and increase the long-term sustainability of batteries, more abundant energy storage materials are required.\n Sodium is the 6th most abundant element in the earth, making it significantly more abundant than Li. Na shares a similar chemistry to Li, helping advance research into sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, there are many challenges associated with SIBs, such as slower diffusion kinetics and reduced cycling stability due to the larger iconic radius of Na ions (1.02 Å (Na+) vs 0.76Å (Li+)) (1). This issue leads to incompatibility of most current anode materials used in LIBs, necessitating the identification of alternative materials (2).\n Transition metal sulfides (TMS) have great potential as anode materials for SIBs due to their high theoretical capacities as a result of conversion-based reactions occuring during cycling (3). However, conversion-based materials suffer from volume expansion during the sodiation and desodation process (4). CuS (covellite) has attracted a lot of attention and has a theoretical capacity of 560mA.h/g and electrical conductivity of ∼10−3Scm−1 (2,5). Unfortunately, CuS requires significant modifications to enhance its structural stability such as the formation of rGO composites or intricate morphological alteration to mitigate volume expansion during cycling.\n Herein, we address the addition of a second transition metal, vanadium, to form a ternary material (Cu3VS4) that enables cycling stability. Cu3VS4 is produced via a colloidal hot injection method to allow for high precision control over the morphology and phase purity. Factors such as ligand exchange, voltage profile, electrolyte selection, phase transformation (via in-situ and ex-situ studies), and SEI layer formation are also investigated to understand their contributions to the long-term stability of the cell. This study provides a mechanistic insight into the factors that affect the long-term stability of the material, taking a step closer to the production of sustainable materials for energy storage devices.\n \n References:\n \n \n Li L, Zheng Y, Zhang S, Yang J, Shao Z, Guo Z.

        "abstract": "Cost concerns have promoted the rise of Na-based batteries as an alternative to Li-based batteries, and the energy density pursuits have brought attention to Na metal anodes. Numerous studies have been conducted on the failure mechanisms and improvement methods of Na metal batteries (NMBs) at room temperature; however, the low-temperature applications are still faced with more complex challenges. On the basis of the concentration effect of the electrolytes, we propose a dilute electrolyte for the low-temperature operation of NMBs. With the low salt concentration and tetrahydrofuran cosolvent, the affinity between Na ions and the solvent molecules is weakened to achieve fast reaction kinetics at low temperatures. The designed electrolyte enables an effectively decreased cell impedance, which improves the cycling stability of Na symmetric cells. As a result, the full cell paired with the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode maintains a capacity of 80 mAh/g over 250 cycles at -20 °C. This work provides an electrolyte design strategy toward low-temperature NMBs.",

Herein, Fe7 S8 encapsulated in carbon-sulfur bonds doped hollow carbon fibers (NHCFs-S-Fe7 S8 ) is designed and synthesized for sodium-ion storage. The NHCFs-S-Fe7 S8 including metallic-phase Fe7 S8 embrace higher electron specific conductivity, electrochemical reversibility, and fast sodium-ion diffusion. Moreover, the carbonaceous fibers with polar CSFe bonds of NHCFs-S-Fe7 S8 exhibit a fixed confinement effect for electrochemical conversion intermediates contributing to long cycle life. In conclusion, combined with theoretical study and experimental analysis, the multinomial optimized NHCFs-S-Fe7 S8 is demonstrated to integrate a suitable structure for higher capacity, fast charging, and longer cycle life.

        "title": "(Invited) Safety and Performance Testing of Commercial Sodium-Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged on the global market and are poised to complement the ubiquitous li-ion battery (LIB). SIBs deliver a lower energy density than LIBs but utilize more globally abundant materials and boasts a higher degree of safety. These batteries possess similarities to LIBs but contain a wider range of materials due to the different size and reactivity of the alkali ion. Herein we utilize accelerating rate calorimetry (ARC) and electrochemical analysis to characterize the safety and performance of two cell types. The Cell A contains an aqueous electrolyte and has power capability (up to 80 C or 200 A) but low energy density (~30 Wh/kg), while the Cell B cell is non-aqueous and delivers higher energy density (~80 Wh/kg). ARC reveals benign failure modes compared to LIBs for single cells and 3 cells touching. Calorimetry also reveals minimal self-heating during charge/discharge, mitigating need for pack thermal management. Electrochemical analysis identifies impressive rate capability (tested up to 20 A) and a wide range of ambient temperatures (-20 to 45 °C). Both cells utilize aluminum for both positive and negative current collectors, since sodium and aluminum do not alloy. This is unique in comparison to LIBs, that require a copper current collector at the anode, preventing low voltage storage, where the copper reduces and dissolves. Therefore we investigated “de-energized” or 0 V storage of both SIBs. Cell A proved robust to these excursions, while Cell B exhibited capacity loss but maintained a high degree of safety.",

        "abstract": "Developing anodes with high and stable energy density for both gravimetric and volumetric storage is vital for high-performance lithium/sodium-ion batteries. Herein, an SnSe/FLG (few-layer graphene) composite with high tap density (2.3 g cm-3) is synthesized via plasma milling method, in which SnSe nanoparticles are strongly bound with the FLG matrix, owing to both Sn-C and Se-C bonds, to form nanosized primary particles and then assemble to microsized secondary granules. The FLG can effectively alleviate the large stress generated from volume expansion of SnSe during cycling, based on its superstrength. Furthermore, as demonstrated by the density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, the Sn-C and Se-C co-bonding benefitting from the formation of substantial vacancy defects on the P-milling synthesized FLG enables strong affinity between SnSe nanoparticles and FLG matrix, preventing SnSe from aggregating and detaching even after long-term cycling. As anode for lithium-ion batteries, it exhibits high gravimetric and volumetric capacity (864.8 mAh g-1 and 1990 mAh cm-3 at 0.2 A g-1), high rate (612.6 mAh g-1 even at 5.0 A g-1) and the longest life among the reported SnSe-based anodes (capacity retention of 92.8% after 2000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1). Subsequently, impressive cyclic life (capacity retention of 91.6% after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1) is also achieved for sodium-ion batteries. Therefore, the SnSe/FLG composite is a promising anode for high-performance lithium/sodium-ion batteries.",

        "title": "Binding SnO2 Nanoparticles with MoS2 Nanosheets Toward Highly Reversible and Cycle‐Stable Lithium/Sodium Storage",
        "abstract": "SnO2, with its high theoretical capacity, abundant resources, and environmental friendliness, is widely regarded as a potential anode material for lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs). Nevertheless, the coarsening of the Sn nanoparticles impedes the reconversion back to SnO2, resulting in low coulombic efficiency and rapid capacity decay. In this study, we fabricated a heterostructure by combining SnO2 nanoparticles with MoS2 nanosheets via plasma‐assisted milling. The heterostructure consists of in‐situ exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets predominantly in 1 T phase, which tightly encase the SnO2 nanoparticles through strong bonding. This configuration effectively mitigates the volume change and particle aggregation upon cycling. Moreover, the strong affinity of Mo, which is the lithiation product of MoS2, toward Sn plays a pivotal role in inhibiting the coarsening of Sn nanograins, thus enhancing the reversibility of Sn to SnO2 upon cycling. Consequently, the SnO2/MoS2 heterostructure exhibits superb performance as an anode material for LIBs, demonstrating high capacity, rapid rate capability, and extended lifespan. Specifically, discharged/charged at a rate of 0.2 A g−1 for 300 cycles, it achieves a remarkable reversible capacity of 1173.4 mAh g−1. Even cycled at high rates of 1.0 and 5.0 A g−1 for 800 cycles, it still retains high reversible capacities of 1005.3 and 768.8 mAh g−1, respectively. Moreover, the heterostructure exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance in both full LIBs and sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "title": "Controllable Synthesis of Novel Orderly Layered VMoS2 Anode Materials with Super Electrochemical Performance for Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), being an attractive candidate of lithium-ion batteries, have attracted widespread attention as a result of sufficient sodium resource with low price and their comparable suitability in the field of energy storage. However, one of the main challenges for their wide-scale application is to develop suitable anode materials with excellent electrochemical performance. Herein, a novel orderly layered VMoS2 (OL-VMS) anode material was synthesized through a facile hydrothermal self-assembly approach followed by a heating procedure. As the anode material of the SIBs, the unique structure of OL-VMS not only facilitated the rapid migration of sodium ions between the stacked layers but also provided a stable framework for the volume change in the process of intercalation/deintercalation. In addition, vanadium mediating in the framework caused more defects to produce abundant storage sites for Na+. As such, the obtained OL-VMS-based anode exhibited high reversible capacities of 602.9 mAh g-1 at 0.2 mA g-1 and 534 mAh g-1 even after 190-cycle operation at 2 A g-1. Furthermore, the OL-VMS-based anode delivered an outstanding specific capacity of 626.4 mAh g-1 after 100-cycle testing at 2 A g-1 in a voltage range from 0.01 to 3 V. In particular, even in the absence of conductive carbon, it still showed an excellent specific capacity of 260 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 130 cycles in a 0.3-3 V voltage range, which should contribute to the cost reduction and energy density increase.",

        "abstract": "In this study, V5+ doped sodium titanate nanorods were successfully synthesized by a sol-gel method with different optimized vanadium concentrations. Before testing as a promising anode material for sodium ion battery (SIB) application, the samples were systematically characterized. It was clearly observed that V5+ doping significantly affects the phase formation of sodium titanate samples and leads to the alteration of the major phase of Na2Ti3O7 to a single Na2Ti6O13 phase with increasing doping concentrations. Electrochemical investigations clearly showed that the optimized 15 wt% V5+ doped sample exhibits the highest capacity of 136 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 900 cycles as well as better rate capability than the undoped sample by delivering 101 mA h g-1 capacity at a high current density of 1000 mA g-1. It is believed that the incorporation of highly charged V5+ in sodium titanate produces oxygen vacancies along with partial reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+, resulting in improved electronic conductivity. The utilization of oxygen vacancies also preserves the integrity of the electrode, giving rise to long term cycling. Thereby, V5+ doping was found to be an effective strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of the sodium titanate anode for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Inferior rate performance, insufficient cycle life, and low mass loading have restricted the practical application of hard carbon (HC) anodes in sodium-ion batteries (NIBs). Here, a compatible strategy is developed by matching HC anodes with an ether-based electrolyte. Systematical investigation reveals that good compatibility of the electrode-electrolyte systems forms thinner but a more sustainable solid-electrolyte interphase and delivers a higher ionic conductivity and Na+ ion diffusion coefficient than the commonly used ester-based electrolytes. Therefore, an excellent electrochemical performance is demonstrated with a long cycle life (∼196 mA h/g and 90% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 1 A/g), a super rate capability (∼51% capacity retention at 10 A/g) at a mass loading of 1.5 mg/cm2, and a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 85.9%. More importantly, a high reversible areal capacity of 4.3 mA h/cm2 can be achieved at an ultrahigh mass loading of 17 mg/cm2, superior to all reported HC anodes. Our findings not only shed light on the design of high-performance battery systems but also promise a commercial transformation from the lab test to mass production of NIBs.",

        "abstract": "Metal thiophosphite has demonstrated promising application potential as an anode material for sodium‐ion batteries. Nevertheless, the intrinsic low electrical conductivity and drastic volume expansion impede its commercialization. Herein, a series of metal thiophosphite/Ti3C2Tx (metal = Fe, Ni, Co, and Cd) composites are constructed via Lewis acidic molten salt etching followed by synchronous phospho‐sulfurization. The Ti3C2Tx substrate endows the thiophosphite/Ti3C2Tx hybrids with high electrical conductivity. Importantly, thiophosphite grown on the MXene layers exhibits a 3D cross‐linked structure, which not only facilitates electron/ion transport, but also maintains robust structural stability owing to the space confinement effect. As a proof of concept, FePS3/Ti3C2Tx demonstrates remarkable rate performance (827.4 and 598.1 mAh g−1 at 0.1 and 10 A g−1, respectively) along with long‐term cycling stability (capacity retention of 93.7% after 2000 cycles at 5 A g−1). Impressively, the FePS3/Ti3C2Tx//NVPO full cell exhibits a high reversible capacity of 396.8 mAh g−1 over 1350 cycles at 2 A g−1. The sodium storage mechanism of FePS3/Ti3C2Tx anode is further unveiled through in situ XRD/ex situ HRTEM characterizations and theoretical calculations.

The recyclable pre‐metallation solvents are selected by redox potential analysis to react with Sn to form alloy precursors in a short time. Benefiting from the application of delithiation/desodiation agents with suitable proton concentrations, PSn perfectly inherits the Sn skeleton from precursors. With this method, porous Al, Pb, Bi, and Sb are successfully produced. Finally, the half‐cell with PSn anode prepared by presodiation strategy achieves a great rate property (663 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1) and prominent cycling performance with 71% capacity retention after 7500 cycles (502 mAh g−1) at 5 A g−1.

An increase of the Na content leads to a full conversion of the material with nanocrystalline Cu particles and elemental V embedded in a Na2S matrix. The formation of Na2S is evidenced by 23Na MAS NMR spectra and X-ray powder diffraction. During the charge process the nanocrystalline Cu particles are retained, but no crystalline materials are formed.

        "abstract": "Although solid-state batteries with metal anodes promise to enable safer, higher energy density batteries, metal protrusions (dendrites) grow when charging faster than a critical current density[1,2]. It is generally believed that dendrites grow when plating-induced stresses exceed that required for fracture of the solid-electrolyte[2–4]. Although the electrolyte's fracture toughness is commonly taken as a constant[2–4], here we show that the effective fracture toughness depends markedly upon the metal deposition current density. Based upon operando birefringence microscopy[5], we directly measure dendrite-induced stresses and obtain the mechanical driving force for failure, as well as the electrolyte fracture toughness. We find that increasing current densities embrittle the solid electrolyte—diminishing the fracture toughness by as much as 70%. Cryogenic Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (Cryo-STEM) reveals decomposed electrolyte phases at the dendrite tip. This decomposition is associated with a volume contraction consistent with embrittlement of the electrolyte. All experiments were conducted on the most electrochemically stable Li-ion conducting solid electrolyte (tantalum-doped lithium lanthanum zirconium oxide); the fracture toughness of less stable electrolytes (e.g., agryodites) may be even more susceptible to such embrittlement. The collective results indicate that “electrochemical embrittlement” markedly weakens the electrolyte, enabling dendrite growth—even when such degradation has negligible effect on bulk electrochemical properties.\n References: \n \n Sudworth, J.

        "title": "Reduced Graphene-Oxide-Encapsulated MoS2/Carbon Nanofiber Composite Electrode for High-Performance Na-Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been increasingly studied due to sodium (Na) being an inexpensive ionic resource (Na) and their battery chemistry being similar to that of current lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, SIBs have faced substantial challenges in developing high-performance anode materials that can reversibly store Na+ in the host structure. To address these challenges, molybdenum sulfide (MoS2)-based active materials have been considered as promising anodes, owing to the two-dimensional layered structure of MoS2 for stably (de)inserting Na+. Nevertheless, intrinsic issues of MoS2—such as low electronic conductivity and the loss of active S elements after a conversion reaction—have limited the viability of MoS2 in practical SIBs. Here, we report MoS2 embedded in carbon nanofibers encapsulated with a reduced graphene oxide (MoS2@CNFs@rGO) composite for SIB anodes. The MoS2@CNFs@rGO delivered a high capacity of 345.8 mAh g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 for 90 cycles. The CNFs and rGO were synergistically taken into account for providing rapid pathways for electrons and preventing the dissolution of S sources during repetitive conversion reactions. This work offers a new point of view to realize MoS2-based anode materials in practical SIBs.",

In addition, the cell uses graphite as the X-ray window instead of beryllium, and it is easy to operate and maintain. Test examples on lithium insertion/extraction in two spinel-type LIB electrode materials (Li4Ti5O12 anode and LiMn2O4 cathode) are presented as well as first results on sodium extraction from a layered SIB cathode material (Na0.84Fe0.56Mn0.44O2).",

        "abstract": "Carbon-based materials have received wide attention as electrodes for energy storage and conversion owing to their rapid mass transfer processes, outstanding electronic conductivities, and high stabilities. Here, sulfur-doped carbonized bacterial cellulose (S-CBC) was prepared as a high-performance anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) by simultaneous carbonization and sulfidation using the bacterial cellulose membrane produced by microbial fermentation as the precursor. Doping sublimed sulfur powder into CBC results in a greater degree of disorder and defects, buffering the volume expansion during the cycle. Significantly, the three-dimensional (3D) network structure of bacterial cellulose endows S-CBC with flexible self-support. As an anode for sodium ion batteries, S-CBC exhibits a high specific capacity of 302.9 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 50 cycles and 177.6 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1 after 1000 cycles. Compared with the CBC electrode, the S-CBC electrode also exhibits enhanced rate performance in sodium storage. Moreover, theoretical simulations reveal that Na+ has good adsorption stability and a faster diffusion rate in S-CBC. The doping of the S element introduces defects that enlarge the interlayer distance, and the synergies of adsorption and bonding are the main reasons for its high performance. These results indicate the potential application prospects of S-CBC as a flexible binder-free electrode for high-performance SIBs.",

        "title": "Dual Carbon Design Strategy for Anodes of Sodium-Ion Battery: Mesoporous CoS2/CoO on Open Framework Carbon-Spheres with rGO Encapsulating.",
        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfides and oxides with high theoretical capacities have been regarded as promising anode candidates for a sodium-ion battery (SIB); however, they have critical issues including sluggish electrochemical kinetics and poor long-term stability. Herein, a dual carbon design strategy is proposed to integrate with highly active heterojunctions to overcome the above issues. In this new design, CoS2/CoO hollow dodecahedron heterojunctions are sandwiched between open framework carbon-spheres (OFCs) and a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanomembrane (OFC@CoS2/CoO@rGO). The CoS2/CoO heterojunctions effectively promote electron transfer on their surface and provide more electrochemical active sites through their hierarchical hollow structures assembled by nanodots. Meanwhile, the dual-carbon framework forms a highly conductive network that enables a better rate capability. More importantly, the dual carbon can greatly buffer volume expansion and stable reaction interfaces of electrode material during the charge/discharge process. Benefitting from their synergistical effects, the OFC@CoS2/CoO@rGO electrode achieves a high reversible capacity of 460 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 and still maintains 205.3 mAh g-1 even when current density is increased by 200 times when used as an anode material for SIBs. Their cycling property is also remarkable with a maintained capacity of 161 mAh g-1 after 3500 charging/discharging cycles at a high current density of 1 A g-1. The dual-carbon strategy is demonstrated to be effective for enhanced reaction kinetics and long-term cycling property, providing siginificant guidance for preparing other high-performance electrode materials.",

However, challenges arise particularly with anodes such as hard carbon (HC), which exhibits a low working plateau (less than 0.1 V vs Na/Na+) and is susceptible to sodium dendrite issues under high current densities. In this study, a cost‐effective SIB system comprising Na2.4Fe1.8(SO4)3 (NFS) cathode, NaTi2(PO4)3 (NTP) anode, and ester‐based electrolyte is assembled to solve the fast‐charging obstacle. Benefiting from the fast sodium‐ion diffusion kinetics and relatively high voltage platform of NTP anode, this full cell can work for 10 000 cycles at 10 C rate with a notable capacity retention of 70.7%. Moreover, this investigation reveals that the full cell can operate safely between ‐50 to 90 °C even with an ester‐based electrolyte, thereby showcasing broad application prospects. This work provides a valuable guidance for designing fast charging and wide temperature SIBs.",

Benefiting from such unique characteristic, AAC exhibits 691.7 mAh g−1 after 1200 cycles at 2 A g−1, and achieves 459.7, 335.4, 288.7, 251.7, and 213.5 mAh g−1 at 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5 A g−1 in rate response for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) based on conversion‐type metal sulfide (MS) anodes have attracted extraordinary attention due to relatively high capacity and intrinsic safety. The highly reversible conversion of M/Na2S to pristine MS in charge plays a vital role with regard to the electrochemical performance. Here, taking conventional MoS2 as an example, guided by theoretical simulations, a catalyst of iron single atoms on nitrogen‐doped graphene (SAFe@NG) is selected and first used as a substrate to facilitate the reaction kinetics of MoS2 in the discharging process. In the following charging process, using a combination of spectroscopy and microscopy, it is demonstrated that the SAFe@NG catalyst enables an efficient reversible conversion reaction of Mo/Na2S→NaMoS2→MoS2. Moreover, theoretical simulations reveal that the reversible conversion mechanism shows favorable formation energy barrier and reaction kinetics, in which SAFe@NG with the Fe–N4 coordination center facilitates the uniform dispersion of Na2S/Mo and the decomposition of Na2S and NaMoS2. Therefore, efficient reversible conversion reaction MoS2↔NaMoS2↔Mo/Na2S is enabled by the SAFe@NG catalyst. This work contributes new avenues for designing conversion‐type materials with an efficient reversible mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Polymerization-induced phase separation of nanoparticle-filled solution is demonstrated as a simple approach to control the structure of porous composites. These composites are subsequently demonstrated as the active component for sodium ion battery anode. To synthesize the composites, we dissolved/dispersed titanium oxide (anatase) nanoparticles (for sodium insertion) and poly(hydroxybutyl methacrylate) (PHBMA, porogen) in furfuryl alcohol (carbon precursor) containing a photoacid generator (PAG). UV exposure converts the PAG to a strong acid that catalyzes the furfuryl alcohol polymerization. This polymerization simultaneously decreases the miscibility of the PHBMA and reduces the mobility in the mixture to kinetically trap the phase separation. Carbonization of this polymer composite yields a porous nanocomposite. This nanocomposite exhibits nearly 3-fold greater gravimetric capacity in Na-ion batteries than the same titanium oxide nanoparticles that have been coated with carbon. This improved performance is attributed to the morphology as the carbon content in the composite is five times that of the coated nanoparticles. The porous composite materials exhibit stable cyclic performance. Moreover, the battery performance using materials from this polymerization-induced phase separation method is reproducible (capacity within 10% batch-to-batch). This simple fabrication methodology may be extendable to other systems and provides a facile route to generate reproducible hierarchical porous morphology that can be beneficial in energy storage applications.",

In this work, ultrasmall Nb2O5 nanoparticles wrapped with nitrogen-doped carbon (denoted as Nb2O5@NC) were delicately synthesized via a facile sol-gel method and subsequent heat treatment. The unique structure of ultrasmall Nb2O5 nanoparticles in a carbonaceous matrix can not only effectively shorten the transmission distance for both ions/electrons but also relieve the strain and stress caused by volume variation during the sodiation/desodiation process. In addition, the synergistic effect of nitrogen doping and carbon coating can further improve the electronic conductivity and pseudocapacitive behavior of the active materials, thus promoting the rapid electrochemical reaction kinetics of the Nb2O5@NC composite. The obtained 600-Nb2O5@NC-2 anode exhibits superior rate capability and outstanding cycling stability, delivering a reversible capacity of 196 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 1000 cycles. Even at high current densities of 5 A g-1 and 10 A g-1, the long-life cycling tests show that the reversible capacities still remain at 128.4 mA h g-1 and 95.9 mA h g-1 after 3000 cycles, respectively, which is the best performance of Nb2O5-based anodes at high current densities so far. These results indicate that the feasible synthetic strategy of Nb2O5@NC is an effective approach to develop high-performance Nb2O5-based anodes for large-scale energy storage.",

Ultrathin WS2 nanosheets have been successfully embedded into the ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-3) framework. Owing to the few-layered nanostructure of WS2 , as well as the high electronic conductivity and the volume confinement effect of CMK-3, the material shows larger discharge capacity, better rate capability, and improved cycle stability than pristine WS2 . When tested in lithium-ion batteries, the material delivers a reversible capacity of 720 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g-1 . A large discharge capacity of 307 mA h g-1 is obtained at a current density of 2 A g-1 . When used in sodium-ion batteries, the material exhibits a capacity of 333 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 without capacity fading after 70 cycles. A discharge capacity of 230 mA h g-1 is obtained at 2 A g-1 .

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are widely considered a hopeful alternative to lithium‐ion battery technology. However, they still face challenges, such as low rate capability, unsatisfactory cycling stability, and inferior variable‐temperature performance. In this study, a hierarchical Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) @reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/carbon nanotube (CNT) composite (NVPF@rGO/CNT) is successfully constructed. This composite features 0D Na3V2(PO4)2F3 nanoparticles are coated by a cross‐linked 3D conductive network composed of 2D rGO and 1D CNT. Furthermore, the intrinsic Na+ storage mechanism of NVPF@rGO/CNT through comprehensive characterizations is unveiled. The synthesized NVPF@rGO/CNT exhibits fast ionic/electronic transport and excellent structural stability within wide working temperatures (−40–50 °C), owing to the zero‐strain NVPF and the coated rGO/CNT conductive network that reduces diffusion distance for ions and electrons. Moreover, the stable integration between NVPF and rGO/CNT enables outstanding structural stability to alleviate strain and stress induced during the cycle. Additionally, a practice full cell is assembled employing a hard carbon anode paired with an NVPF@rGO/CNT cathode, which provides a decent capacity of 105.2 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C, thereby attaining an ideal energy density of 242.7 Wh kg−1. This work provides valuable insights into developing high‐energy and power‐density cathode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are considered promising alternatives to lithium ion batteries for grid-scale and other energy storage applications because of the broad geographical distribution and low cost of sodium relative to lithium. Here, fabrication and characterization of high gravimetric and volumetric capacity 3D Ni-supported Sb2 O3 anodes for SIBs are presented. The electrodes are prepared by colloidal templating and pulsed electrodeposition followed by heat treatment. The colloidal template is optimized to provide large pore interconnects in the 3D scaffold to enable a high active materials loading and accommodate a large volume expansion during cycling. An electrodeposited loading of 1.1 g cm-3 is chosen to enable a combined high gravimetric and volumetric capacity. At this loading, the electrodes exhibit a specific capacity of ≈445 mA h g-1 and a volumetric capacity of ≈488 mA h cm-3 with a capacity retention of 89% after 200 cycles at 200 mA g-1 . The stable cycling performance can be attributed to the 3D metal scaffold, which supports active materials undergoing large volume changes, and an initial heat treatment appears to improve the adhesion of the Sb2 O3 to the metal scaffold.",

        "title": "Co-Intercalation Batteries (CoIBs): The Use of TiS2 As Electrode for Solvent Co-Intercalation in Sodium-Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "With the rising demand for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have become an attractive alternative with the promise of improved safety, reduced cost, and lower environmental impact.1 However, the larger ion size of sodium cation has major consequence on the battery chemistry, which provides several challenges and opportunities for designing electrode materials and electrolyte solutions.2\n \n Graphite is the currently most used anode material in LIBs. However, its use in SIBs, with traditional carbonate-based electrolytes, results in very poor specific capacities due to unfavorable thermodynamic processes.3\n \n A strategy around this problem is to choose different solvents: Ethers and in particular glymes can exhibit a co-intercalation behavior into the graphite structure by forming ternary graphite intercalation compounds.4, 5 Although the co-intercalation of solvent molecules with sodium cation leads to a large increase in the graphite framework, the cycle life and rate capability of the reaction are excellent.\n Regardless of this, there is a lack of evidence for a comparable reaction with other electrode materials. Hence, it would be of interest to identify a cathode material that operates via this same mechanism. A battery based on solvent co-intercalation at both electrodes can have minimized charge-transfer resistances due to the absence of desolvation steps, and great cycle life. Thus, such a system can show high power density over many cycles. It has also been shown that stripping of the solvation shell can be the rate limiting step for battery operation, especially at subzero temperatures.6 Such a solvent co-intercalation battery (CoIB) could therefore be more energy efficient compared to other batteries or could enable a better low-temperature performance.\n Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as promising anode materials owing to their low cost, high electric conductivity, good thermal stability and environmental friendliness. Among them, titanium sulphide (TiS2), with a two-dimensional framework, exhibits several advantages such as a high conductivity (compare to other metal oxides), a larger interlayer distance (0.569 nm) compared to graphite (0.335 nm) and high stability. 7\n \n Several papers have reported on the use of TiS2 as an anode material for SIBs, and observed that the voltage profiles and electrochemical behaviour of the system is highly dependent on the choice of electrolyte. However, this has seldomly been explicitly stated and the cause of the electrolyte dependence has never been investigated. By using operando and in-situ techniques such as Operando XRD and dilatometry, Na-diglyme complexes were showed to co-intercalate, similar as graphite, into TiS2. In contrast, no signs of solvent co-intercalation are observed in cyclic ethers and conventional carbonate-based electrolytes – where instead the redox reaction with TiS2 results in the formation of different NaxTiS2 compounds.\n As we identified TiS2 as “co-intercalation electrode” in glyme-based electrolytes it served to create the first ever solvent co-intercalation battery (CoIB – pronounced Co-IB) which was done by pairing TiS2 (positive electrode) with graphite (negative electrode).8 This work could enable the development of highly energy efficient batteries with minimum charge transfer resistances and\n \n References\n \n \n I.

        "abstract": "It is still very urgent and challenging to simultaneously develop high‐rate and long‐cycle oxide cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) because of the sluggish kinetics and complex multiphase evolution during cycling. Here, the concept of accurately manipulating structural evolution and formulating high‐performance heterostructured biphasic layered oxide cathodes by local chemistry and orbital hybridization modulation is reported. The P2‐structure stoichiometric composition of the cathode material shows a layered P2‐ and O3‐type heterostructure that is explicitly evidenced by various macroscale and atomic‐scale techniques. Surprisingly, the heterostructured cathode displays excellent rate performance, remarkable cycling stability (capacity retention of 82.16% after 600 cycles at 2 C), and outstanding compatibility with hard carbon anode because of the integrated advantages of intergrowth structure and local environment regulation. Meanwhile, the formation process from precursors during calcination and the highly reversible dynamic structural evolution during the Na+ intercalation/deintercalation process are clearly articulated by a series of in situ characterization techniques. Also, the intrinsic structural properties and corresponding electrochemical behavior are further elucidated by the density of states and electron localization function of density functional theory calculations. Overall, this strategy, which finely tunes the local chemistry and orbitals hybridization for high‐performance SIBs, will open up a new field for other materials.",

In the present work, a walnut-like MoO2 architecture (W-MoO2) with opened multi-channel and interconnected skeleton was prepared in a tube furnace, providing an interconnected ion/electron dual-pathway, which effectively facilitates Na+ diffusion and reduces the internal resistance of the cells.

        "title": "Sodium Citrate Electrolyte Additive to Improve Zinc Anode Behavior in Aqueous Zinc-Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "Despite features of cost-effectiveness, high safety, and superior capacity, aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) have issues of uncontrolled dendritic cell failure and poor Zn utilization, resulting in inferior cycling reversibility. Herein, the environmentally friendly and naturally abundant sodium citrate (SC) was adopted as a dual-functional additive for ZnSO4-based (ZSO) electrolytes. Owing to the abundant hydrogen-bond donors and hydrogen-bond acceptors of SC, the Zn2+-solvation shell is interrupted to facilitate Zn desolvation, resulting in inhibited corrosion reactions. Additionally, sodium ions (Na+) from the SC additive with a lower effective reduction potential than that of zinc ions (Zn2+) form an electrostatic shield inhibiting the formation of initial surface protuberances and subsequent Zn dendrite growth. This assists in the Zn three-dimensional (3D) diffusion and deposition, thereby effectively enhancing cycling stability. Specifically, a long cycling lifespan (more than 760 h) of the Zn//Zn symmetric cell is achieved with a 2 M ZSO-1.0 SC electrolyte at a current density of 1 mA cm−2. When coupled with the NaV3O8·1.5 H2O (NVO) cathode, the full battery containing SC additive exhibited a capacity retention rate (40.0%) and a cycling life of 400 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1 compared with that of pure ZnSO4 electrolyte (23.8%). This work provides a protocol for selecting an environmentally friendly and naturally abundant dual-functional electrolyte additive to achieve solvation shell regulation and Zn anode protection for the practical large-scale application of ZIBs.",

        "abstract": "As a two-dimensional layered material with a structure analogous to that of graphene, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) holds great promise in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, recent research findings have revealed some disadvantages in two-dimensional (2D) materials such as poor interlayer conductivity and structural instability, resulting in poor rate performance and short cycle life for SIBs. Herein, we designed MoS2 nanoflowers with an ultra-wide spacing interlayer (W-MoS2/C) anchored on special double carbon tubes to construct three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures. When tested as an anode material in a SIB, the as-prepared CNT@NCT@W-MoS2/C sample achieves high capacities (530 and 230 mA h g-1 at current densities of 0.1 and 2 A g-1, respectively). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the ultra-wide spacing MoS2/C structure is beneficial for the chemical adsorption of sodium ions and facilitates redox reactions. The wide interlayer spacing and the presence of an intermediate carbon layer provide a rapid diffusion channel for ions and offer a free space for volume expansion of the electrode material.",

However, traditional SIBs toward practical applications still suffer from low rate capability and poor cycle induced by pulverization and amorphorization of anodes at high rate (over 5 C) during the fast ion insertion/extraction process. The present work demonstrates a robust strategy for a variety of (Sb-C, Bi-C, Sn-C, Ge-C, Sb-Bi-C) freestanding metal-carbon framework thin films via a space-confined superassembly (SCSA) strategy. The sodium-ion battery employing the Sb-C framework exhibits an unprecedented performance with a high specific capacity of 246 mAh g-1, long life cycle (5000 cycles), and superb capacity retention (almost 100%) at a high rate of 7.5 C (3.51A g-1). Further investigation indicates that the unique framework structure enables unusual reversible crystalline-phase transformation, guaranteeing the fast and long-cyclability sodium storage.

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) possess the potential to realize low-cost and large-scale energy storage due to the abundance of sodium. However, the large ionic radius of sodium often leads to sluggish kinetics and large volume change, limiting the further development of SIBs. Layered MoS2, with a large interlayer distance, is a promising intercalation anode material for SIBs. In this work, we report the synthesis of methyl-functionalized MoS2 (M-MoS2) nanosheets through a facile second solvothermal method. During the second solvothermal treatment, the pristine MoS2 is mostly converted from the 2H to 1T phase and the interlayer distance is expanded from 0.65 to 0.80 nm. When evaluated as the anode for SIBs, the M-MoS2 exhibits superior cycling stability and rate capability. Kinetic analysis shows that the capacity is mainly contributed from a pseudocapacitive process. Ex situ XRD shows that the M-MoS2 exhibits inhibited lattice breathing and thus reduced volume change during cycling. This work demonstrates that the M-MoS2 is a promising candidate for pseudocapacitive sodium storage.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal chalcogenides have received great attention as promising anode candidates for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the undesirable cyclic life and inferior rate capability still restrict their practical applications. The design of micro-nano hierarchitectures is considered as a possible strategy to facilitate the electrochemical reaction kinetics and strengthen the electrode structure stability upon repeated Na+ insertion/extraction. Herein, urchin-like Fe3 Se4 hierarchitectures are successfully prepared and developed as a novel anode material for SIBs. Impressively, the as-prepared urchin-like Fe3 Se4 can present an ultrahigh rate capacity of 200.2 mAh g-1 at 30 A g-1 and a prominent capacity retention of 99.9% over 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1 , meanwhile, a respectable initial coulombic efficiency of ≈100% is achieved. Through the conjunct study of in situ X-ray diffraction, ex situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy, as well as cyclic voltammetry curves, it is intriguing to reveal that the phase transformation from monoclinic to amorphous structure accompanied by the pseudocapacitive Na+ storage behavior accounts for the superior electrochemical performance.

Producing carbon materials from bio by-products is an intriguing strategy for sodium-ion battery anode manufacture and for high-value utilization of biomass.

The morphology and structure of the PPHC were influenced by the carbonization temperature, as evidenced by physicochemical characterization. The PPHC pyrolyzed at 1100 °C showed expanded interlayer spacing and appropriate oxygen group content. When used as a sodium ion battery anode, the PPHC-1100 demonstrated a reversible capacity of up to 330 mAh g−1, maintaining 174 mAh g−1 at an increased current rate of 1 C. After 200 cycles at 0.5 C, the capacity delivered by PPHC-1100 was 175 mAh g−1. The electrochemical behavior of PPHC electrodes was investigated, revealing that the PPHC-1100 possessed increased capacitive-controlled energy storage and improved ion transport properties, which explained its excellent electrochemical performance.

        "abstract": "2D transition metal carbides and nitrides, named MXenes, are attracting increasing attentions and showing competitive performance in energy storage devices including electrochemical capacitors, lithium‐ and sodium‐ion batteries, and lithium–sulfur batteries. However, similar to other 2D materials, MXene nanosheets are inclined to stack together, limiting the device performance. In order to fully utilize MXenes' electrochemical energy storage capability, here, processing of 2D MXene flakes into hollow spheres and 3D architectures via a template method is reported. The MXene hollow spheres are stable and can be easily dispersed in solvents such as water and ethanol, demonstrating their potential applications in environmental and biomedical fields as well. The 3D macroporous MXene films are free‐standing, flexible, and highly conductive due to good contacts between spheres and metallic conductivity of MXenes. When used as anodes for sodium‐ion storage, these 3D MXene films exhibit much improved performances compared to multilayer MXenes and MXene/carbon nanotube hybrid architectures in terms of capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability. This work demonstrates the importance of MXene electrode architecture on the electrochemical performance and can guide future work on designing high‐performance MXene‐based materials for energy storage, catalysis, environmental, and biomedical applications.",

        "abstract": "Developing non‐graphitic carbons with unique microstructure is a popular strategy to enhance the significant potential in practical applications of sodium‐ion batteries (SIB), while the electrochemical performance imbalances arising from their intricate active surface and porous structure pose significant challenges to its commercialization. Inspired by the structure of biological cell membranes, N/P co‐doped hard carbon nanospheres (NPCS) anodes with abundant ultramicropores (≈0.6 nm) are proposed and synthesized as robust sodium anodes. Based on density functional theory calculations, optimizing ultramicropores can enable small Na+ to be well confined within the pores and hinder large solvent molecules from invading and reacting, introducing N/P species contributes to the rapid adsorption/diffusion of Na+. In situ XRD and Raman analysis suggest that the nanoconfinement strategy induced by abundant ultramicropores and N/P co‐doping enables highly reversible electrochemical reactions. Electrochemical test confirms that the nanoconfinement strategy endows the NPCS anode with high reversible capacity (376.3 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1), superior initial coulombic efficiency (87.3% at 1.0 A g−1), remarkable rate capability (155.6 mAh g−1 at 50.0 A g−1) and excellent cycling stability (with capacity retention of ≈94.6% after 10 000 cycles), lightening a promising avenue for developing SIB with robust durability.",

To meet this challenge, herein, we first propose a redox-potential-matched chemical sodiation approach, utilizing phenazine-sodium (PNZ-Na) as the optimal reagent to sodiate the Na3V2(PO4)3 precursor into Na-enriched Na4V2(PO4)3. The spontaneous sodiation reaction enables a fast reduction of one-half V ions from V3+ to V2+, followed by the insertion of one Na+ ion into the NASICON framework, which only takes 90 s to obtain the phase-pure Na4V2(PO4)3 product. When paired with a hard carbon anode, the resulting Na4VP‖HC full cell exhibits a high energy density of 251 W h kg−1, which is 58% higher than that of 159 W h kg−1 for the Na3VP‖HC control cell. Our chemical sodiation methodology provides an innovative approach for designing sodium-rich cathode materials and could serve as an impetus to the development of advanced sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Carbon materials with large capacity and low potential serve as promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Carbon defects offer active sites for sodium storage but sacrifice reversibility, whereas carbon microcrystals improve conductivity but may suffer from low capacity. Herein, the balance between defects and microcrystals is realized by the molecular chemistry method of cross-linking and defect repairing. Real-time spectroscopic analyses reveal that the decomposition of tetrabromophthalic anhydride (TBPA) molecule induces the dehydrogenation of pitch to release small gas molecules to form pseudo-closed pores, followed by the cross-linking of C═O bonds in TBPA with the dehydrogenated pitch to form C─O─C bonds and thus suppress the excessive microcrystal growth. Meanwhile, the decomposition products of TBPA can also react with the dehydrogenated pitch to repair carbon defects. Thanks to the microstructure balance, the as-synthesized carbon material exhibits a smoother ion mass transfer channel (d(002) = 0.386 nm, La = 4.56 nm) and a larger storage space (Vpseudo-closed pore = 0.086 cm3 g-1) than the pitch carbon (PC, d(002) = 0.349 nm, La = 5.90 nm, Vpseudo-closed pore = 0.041 cm3 g-1), increasing the capacity from 162.5 to 336.5 mAh g-1.

        "abstract": "Two new structural forms of Na xCo0.5Ti0.5O2, the layered O3- and P3-forms, were synthesized and comprehensively characterized. Both materials show electrochemical activity as electrodes in Na-ion batteries. During cell charging (desodiation of the Na xCo0.5Ti0.5O2 cathode), we observed a structural phase transformation of O3-Na0.95Co0.5Ti0.5O2 into P3-Na xCo0.5Ti0.5O2, whereas no changes other than conventional unit cell volume shrinkage were detected for P3-Na0.65Co0.5Ti0.5O2. During Na insertion (cell discharging), the reconversion of the P3-form into O3-Na xCo0.5Ti0.5O2 was impeded for both materials and occurs well below 1 V versus Na+/Na only. The reconversion is hindered by the charge and spin transfers of Co (LS-Co3+ → HS-Co2+) and by a significant unit cell volume expansion at the P3 → O3 transformation, as revealed from the magnetization, crystallographic, and spectroscopic studies. As the kinetics of such transformations depend on numerous parameters such as time, temperature, and particle size, a large cell overpotential ensues. An extended cutoff voltage at 0.2 V versus Na+/Na during discharging allows to complete the P3 → O3 transformation and increases the specific discharging capacity to 200 mA h g-1. Moreover, a quasi-symmetrical full cell, based on the O3- and P3-forms, was designed, eliminating safety concerns associated with sodium anodes and delivering a discharge capacity of 130 mA h g-1.",

        "abstract": "Due to their cost-effectiveness, abundant resources, and suitable working potential, sodium-ion batteries are anticipated to establish themselves as a leading technology in the realm of grid energy storage. However, sodium-ion batteries still encounter challenges, including issues related to low energy density and constrained cycling performance. In this study, a self-supported electrode composed of Prussian white/KetjenBlack/MXene (TK−PW) is proposed. In the TK−PW electrode, the MXene layer is coated with Prussian white nanoparticles and KetjenBlack with high conductivity, which is conducive to rapid Na+ dynamics and effectively alleviates the expansion of the electrode. Notably, the electrode preparation method is uncomplicated and economically efficient, enabling large-scale production. Electrochemical testing demonstrates that the TK−PW electrode retains 74.9% of capacity after 200 cycles, with a discharge capacity of 69.7 mAh·g−1 at 1000 mA·g−1. Furthermore, a full cell is constructed, employing a hard carbon anode and TK−PW cathode to validate the practical application potential of the TK−PW electrode.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal phosphides have been extensively investigated owing to their high theoretical capacities and relatively low intercalation potentials vs Li/Li+, but their practical applications have been hindered by low electrical conductivity and dramatic volume variation during cycling. In this work, an interesting strategy for the rational design of graphene (GR) encapsulated with a hollow FeP@carbon nanocomposite (H-FeP@C@GR) via a combination of a hydrothermal route, a carbon-coating process, phosphidation treatment, and carbothermic reaction is reported. The hollow FeP (H-FeP) nanospheres shelled with thin carbon layers are wonderfully incorporated into the GR matrix, interconnecting to form a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical architecture. Such a design offers distinct advantages for FeP-based anode materials for both lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium ion batteries (SIBs). For example, the 3D omnibearing conductive networks from the GR skeleton and outer coating carbon can provide an open freeway for electron/ion transport, promoting the electrode reaction kinetics. In addition, the wrapping of an H-FeP nanosphere in a thin carbon layer enables the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the carbon layer surface instead of on the individual H-FeP surface, preventing the continual re-forming of the SEI. When used as anode materials for LIBs and SIBs, H-FeP@C@GR exhibited excellent electrochemistry performances.",

        "abstract": "Sodium (Na)-ion capacitors possess higher energy density than supercapacitors and higher power density than Na-ion batteries. However, kinetic mismatches between fast capacitive charge storage on the cathode and sluggish battery-type reactions on the anode lead to a poor charge/discharge rate capability and insufficient power output of Na-ion capacitors. Thus, developing suitable anode materials for Na-ion capacitors is urgently desirable. This work demonstrates an electrochemically exfoliated graphite (EEG) anode with enhanced capacitive charge storage, greatly boosting the Na-ion reaction kinetics of co-intercalation. The EEG anode shows a high reversible capacity of 109 mAh g-1 and maintains a good capacity retention of 90% after 1000 cycles. The assembled Na-ion capacitor using the EEG anode can finish the charge/discharge process in less than 10 s, which achieves an ultrahigh power density of 17,500 W kg-1 with an energy density of 17 Wh kg-1. The high capacitive contributions at both the anode and cathode contribute to the fast rate capability and high power output of the fabricated Na-ion capacitors.

In this work, two molecules (Na-CPN and Na-CPP) were synthesized and used as anode materials for SIBs. Structurally, the two compounds are isomers, and they are distinguished by the position of N atoms in phenylpyridine. Na-CPP provides a high reversible capacity of 197 mAh g -1 , excitingly, its capacity could maintain 99.1% even after 350 cycles of 100 mA g -1 . Moreover, after going through 1200 cycles at a current density of 5C, the Na-CPP electrode still retain a capacity rate of 89.9%. These results are impressive.

Herein, 2D Se-rich ZnSe/CoSe2@C heterostructured composite is fabricated via a convenient hydrothermal approach followed by selenization process, and then applied as high-performance anodes for PIBs. For example, the capacity delivered by the heterostructured composite is mainly contributed to the synergistic effect of conversion and alloy/de-alloy processes aroused by K+, where K+ may highly insert or de-insert into Se-rich ZnSe/CoSe2@C.

In this work, we performed first principles calculations to investigate the structural and electrochemical properties of the interface between Na6SOI2 and a metallic Na anode. Our calculations revealed that interfaces could be formed safely, keeping the ultra-fast ionic conductivity of the bulk phase near the interface. Through the electronic structure analysis of the interface models, we found the change of upward valence band bending at the surface to downward band bending at the interface, being accompanied by electronic charge transfer from a metallic Na anode to Na6SOI2 SE at the interface. This work provides valuable atomistic insight into the formation and properties of the interface between SE and alkali metal for enhancing battery performance.",

The general sodium metal anode (SMA), for example, suffers from an unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI), which may induce severe dendrite growth and continuous Na consumption, particularly under high rates. At the same time, the cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) of a widely adopted cathode material Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) has to tolerate the massive volume changes during the rapid Na+ ion intercalation/extraction, resulting in structural degradations and the capacity loss. Here, a facile strategy is reported by introducing aluminum ethoxide to a conventional ether‐based electrolyte, to promote the formation of an alumina‐rich SEI and CEI, which facilitates the rapid Na+ ion transport across the interface and promotes the uniform Na deposition. The resultant Na || Na symmetric cell demonstrates a stable cycling of 4800 h at 10 mA cm−2 and 1 mAh cm−2, and a Na || NVP full cell exhibits a high capacity retention of 81.28% after 6000 cycles at 40C.

VS4 has emerged as a promising anode material for SIBs due to low cost and its unique linear chains structure that can offer potential sites for sodium storage. Herein, we present the growth of VS4 on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as SIBs anode for the first time. The VS4/rGO anode exhibits promising performance in SIBs. It delivers a reversible capacity of 362 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) and a good rate performance. We also investigate the sodium storage behavior of the VS4/rGO. Different than most transition metal sulfides, the VS4/rGO composite experiences a three-step separation mechanism during the sodiation process (VS4 to metallic V and Na2S, then the electrochemical mechanism is akin to Na-S). The VS4/rGO composite proves to be a promising material for rechargeable SIBs.",

However, attaining long‐term stability and high‐capacity performance of SIBs at ultrahigh rates remains a significant challenge due to the large ionic radius and slow kinetic behavior of Na+. Herein, a novel robust anode with a dual‐biomimetic gradient hierarchical architecture is proposed and provide a simple strategy to fabricate this sulfur‐doped mesoporous carbon concave hollow sphere/Ti3C2Tx MXene (SCMX) anode. In addition, Cu2S nanoparticles are in situ embedded into the SCMX architecture by electrochemical induction during the cycling process to act as active sites, which enhances the rate performance and cycling stability. Relying on its hybrid architecture and in situ formed Cu2S, this SCMX anode can achieve high ion accessibility, rich active sites, rapid charge transfer, and favorable structure stability, as disclosed by in/ex situ characterizations. As a result, it exhibits high reversible capacity (745.6 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1), ultrahigh‐rate capability (380.5 mAh g−1 at 50.0 A g−1), and long cycling stability (98.2% capacity retention after 10 000 cycles at 80.0 A g−1).

Nevertheless, it is a big challenge to prepare main group element with high loading content. Here, multifield‐regulated synthesis (MRS) technology is utilized to rapidly produce single‐atom antimony (Sb) metal with a high loading of 15 wt.%. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal the significantly enhanced reaction kinetics of Sb and nitrogen‐doped graphene by multi‐physics field coupling. Compared with common metallic Sb nanoparticles, atomically dispersed Sb displays remarkably improved electrochemical reaction kinetics and stable structure due to the negligible variation of stresses and volume expansion during the pseudocapacitive alloying‐dealloying process. Such extraordinary alloying reaction in well‐dispersed Sb atoms enabling homogeneous ion flow can serve as active nucleation sites for regulating even Na metal nucleation and growth. As a result, copper foil coated with only ≈3 µm thickness of such material exhibits a high Coulombic efficiency of up to 99.99%, an ultra‐low overpotential of 3 mV, and a long lifetime exceeding 2500 h in symmetrical cells.

Herein, we have reported gallium sulfide (Ga2S3) as a novel SIB anode material for the first time. Ga2S3 nanorods have been synthesized via the facile hydrothermal preparation of a GaOOH precursor with subsequent H2S annealing. Mixed with graphene upon electrode preparation, this Ga2S3 electrode maintains a reversible specific capacity of 476 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.4 A g-1, with a coulombic efficiency of over 99%. Ex situ XRD analysis and theoretical calculations are employed to comprehensively elucidate the detailed sodium ion storage mechanism of Ga2S3, which is composed of initial Na+ intercalation, a subsequent multi-step conversion reaction between S and Na+, and an eventual alloying reaction between Ga and Na+ with the end product of Na7Ga13. Further kinetics analysis has demonstrated that the conversion reaction is the rate-limiting step due to a multi-step reaction with the intermediate phase of GaS. Moreover, the appearance of liquid metal Ga, as confirmed via TEM observations and theoretical calculations, can serve as a self-healing agent that repairs cracks in the electrode. Our findings shed light on the further design of Ga-based materials, and they also can be extended to solid-state-battery systems.",

The all‐around encapsulation (plane‐to‐plane contact) architecture that provides a large interface between N‐graphene and SnSb nanocrystal not only effectively enhances the electron conductivity and structural integrity of the overall electrode, but also offers excess interfacial sodium storage, thus leading to much enhanced high‐rate sodium storage capacity and stability, which has been proven by both experimental results and first‐principles simulations.

        "abstract": "The development of anode materials is critical to the success of sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Because of the size difference between Li and Na, the commercial anode material graphite in Li-ion batteries does not work for Na-ion batteries. Thus, it will be ideal if some universal anode materials could work for both Li- and Na-ion batteries with high performance. Inspired by a recent study on the high performance of a 2D-Si2BN sheet as an anode material for Li-ion batteries, we design a three dimensional (3D) porous structure by using the nanoribbons of a Si2BN sheet as building blocks. Based on the state-of-the-art ab initio calculations, we find that the resulting 3D porous Si2BN structure is stable chemically, dynamically and thermally, exhibiting a high specific capacity of 512.42 (341.61 mA h g-1), a low voltage of 0.27 V (0.15 V), a small volume expansion of 2.5% (2.7%), and a low migration energy barrier of 0.44 eV (0.19 eV) for Li- (Na-) ion batteries. These intriguing features, together with the light mass and rich abundance of Si, B and N, suggest that the 3D porous Si2BN structure is a promising candidate for the anode material of both Li- and Na-ion batteries.",

It compensates the irreversible Na uptake at the oxygen-containing functional groups and reacts with carbon defects of five/seven-membered rings for quasi-metallic sodium in HC. The as-formed sodium induces robust NaF-rich SEI on HC in 1.0 M NaPF6 in diglyme, favoring the interfacial reaction kinetics and stable Na+ insertion and extraction. This renders the presodiated HC (pHC) with high ICE of ~100% and capacity retention of 82.4% after 6800 cycles. It is demonstrated to couple with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathodes in full cells to show high capacity retention of ~100% after 700 cycles.

However, it still remains a challenge to obtain a high‐performance hard carbon anode from cost‐effective carbon sources. In addition, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is subjected to continuous rupture during battery cycling, leading to fast capacity decay. Herein, a lignin‐based hard carbon with robust SEI is developed to address these issues, effectively killing two birds with one stone. An innovative gas‐phase removal‐assisted aqueous washing strategy is developed to remove excessive sodium in the precursor to upcycle industrial lignin into high‐value hard carbon, which demonstrated an ultrahigh sodium storage capacity of 359 mAh g−1. It is found that the residual sodium components from lignin on hard carbon act as active sites that controllably regulate the composition and morphology of SEI and guide homogeneous SEI growth by a near‐shore aggregation mechanism to form thin, dense, and organic‐rich SEI. Benefiting from these merits, the as‐developed SEI shows fast Na+ transfer at the interphases and enhanced structural stability, thus preventing SEI rupture and reformation, and ultimately leading to a comprehensive improvement in sodium storage performance.",

        "abstract": "Quasi‐solid‐state electrolytes (QSSE) are a promising candidate for addressing the limitations of liquid and solid electrolytes. However, different ion transport capacities between liquid solvents and polymers can cause localized heterogeneous distribution of Na+ fluxes. In addition, the continuous side reactions occurring at the interface between QSSE and sodium anode lead to uncontrollable dendrites growth. Herein, a novel strategy is designed to integrate the composite electrospun membrane of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 and poly(vinylidene fluoride‐co‐hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF‐HFP) into QSSE, aiming to introduce new fast ion conducting channels at the organic–inorganic interface. The efficient ion transfer pathways can effectively promote the homogenization of ion migration, enabling composite QSSE to achieve an ultrahigh ionic conductivity of 4.1 mS cm−1 at room temperature, with a Na+ transference number as high as 0.54. Moreover, the PVDF‐HFP is preferentially reduced upon contact with the sodium anode to form a “NaF‐rich” solid electrolyte interphase, which effectively suppresses the growth of dendrites. The synergistic combination of multiple strategies can realize exceptional long‐term cycling stability in both sodium symmetric batteries (≈700 h) and full batteries (2100 cycles).

Initially, in situ nitrogen-doped CNTs were grown using a scalable, cost-effective and green synthesis technique. In situ nitrogen doping introduces lattice defects resulting in bamboo-shaped CNTs. The defects were further enriched by opening the ends of the tubes and also by shortening them. This structure demonstrates the high capacity of 278 mA h g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1, which is more than double compared to conventional CNTs. The improved performance of MN-BCNT is attributed to the improved electrical conductivity due to nitrogen doping and the availability of significant active sites as a result of tube shortening.

Herein, N and S co‐doped carbon dots are employed as electrolyte additives in view of their quantum size, excellent dispersion, and polar surface functional groups.

        "abstract": "Benefiting from the abundance and low cost of sodium, sodium-ion batteries show great potential as lithium-ion batteries in application of large-scale energy storage. However, anode material graphite with high theoretical capacity 372 mAh g-1, low charge-discharge plateau potential and good cyclability, widely applied in lithium-ion batteries, exhibited poor electrochemical performance. The larger radius of Na-ion compared to Li-ion hinders the mass and ion transfer during charge-discharge cycling. Thus, anode material with large abundance, stability and high conductivity is crucial for the development and further application of sodium-ion batteries.\n Sodium-ion batteries have the potential to benefit greatly from metallic sulfide anodes, which offer high theoretical capacities. Unfortunately, the practical use of these anodes is limited by poor electrochemical performance, as sulfides tend to expand significantly in volume and Na+ ions exhibit sluggish kinetics during cycling. We have developed a facile and scalable approach to synthesizing a SnS/Sb2S3 heterostructure that is porous and bimetallic, with an additional sulfur and nitrogen co-doped carbon matrix encapsulation (SnS/Sb2S3@SNC). The PAN precursor is mixed homogeneously with SnSbx and S with a ball milling process. The sulfur evaporates from the mixture and reacts with the SnSbx alloy, leading to the formation of bimetallic sulfides SnS/Sb2S3. As a result, voids are generated, which in turn contributes to the development of a porous structure. At the same time, the PAN is carbonized, generating a S, N co-doped carbon matrix. SnS and Sb2S3 are two highly promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries, with high theoretical specific capacity of 1022 mAh g-1 and 947 mAh g-1, respectively. Moreover, bimetallic sulfides possess different bandgap make them ideal components for generating a strong internal electric field on the hetero-interface, which allows to improve the charge carrier transport and interface reaction kinetics. The porous nature of the structure can contain the volume expansion of sulfides during cycling, thereby ensuring superior structural stability. The distinctive heterostructure, in combination with the S, N co-doped carbon matrix, enables fast-charge transport and accelerate Na-ion storage kinetics.\n The SnS/Sb2S3@SNC anode demonstrates impressive electrochemical performance, with high capacities of 425 mAh g-1 at 200 mA g-1 after 100 cycles, and 302 mAh g-1 at 500 mA g-1 after 400 cycles. Additionally, the SnS/Sb2S3 @SNC anode exhibits remarkable rate capability, with a capacity of over 200 mAh g-1 at a high current density of 5000 mA g-1.\n \n \n \n \n \n Figure 1\n",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, sodium‐ion batteries are considered the most promising large‐scale energy storage systems (EESs) due to the low cost and wide distribution of sodium sources as well as the similar working principle to lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs). Therefore, screening suitable materials with high abundance, low cost, and excellent reliability and modified with different strategies based on them is the key point for the development of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). In addition, the ideal anodes with high abundance, and low cost elements also greatly influence the cost of SIB systems, determining the large‐scale application. Herein, recent advances in carbon, iron, manganese, and phosphorus‐based anodes of various types, such as hard carbon, iron oxides, manganese oxides, and red phosphorus, are highlighted. The various sodium storage mechanisms and structure‐function properties for these four types of materials are summarized and analyzed in detail. Considering the commercial profits that the EESs can bring and their suitability for mass electrode manufacturing, the participation of high‐abundance and low‐cost elements such as Fe, Mn, C, and P is convincing and encouraging.",

        "abstract": "The sodium (Na)‐metal anode with high theoretical capacity and low cost is promising for construction of high‐energy‐density metal batteries. However, the unsatisfactory interface between Na and the liquid electrolyte induces tardy ion transfer kinetics and dendritic Na growth, especially at ultralow temperature (−40 °C). Herein, an artificial heterogeneous interphase consisting of disodium selenide (Na2Se) and metal vanadium (V) is produced on the surface of Na (Na@Na2Se/V) via an in situ spontaneous chemical reaction. Such interphase layer possesses high sodiophilicity, excellent ionic conductivity, and high Young's modulus, which can promote Na‐ion adsorption and transport, realizing homogenous Na deposition without dendrites. The symmetric Na@Na2Se/V cell exhibits outstanding cycling life span of over 1790 h (0.5 mA cm−2/1 mAh cm−2) in carbonate‐based electrolyte. More remarkably, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the artificial Na2Se/V hybrid interphase can accelerate the desolvation of solvated Na+ at −40 °C. The Na@Na2Se/V electrode thus exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance in symmetric cell (over 1500 h at 0.5 mA cm−2/0.5 mAh cm−2) and full cell (over 700 cycles at 0.5 C) at −40 °C. This work provides an avenue to design artificial heterogeneous interphase layers for superior high‐energy‐density metal batteries at ambient and ultralow temperatures.",

        "abstract": "The prospects of sodium (Na) metal batteries have been fatally plagued by interfacial Na dendrites, mainly affected by preferred nucleation on the metal anode and the steep gradient of Na ions in the electrolyte, leading to limited Coulombic efficiency and short lifespans. Herein, an electrochemically inert potassium-based Na-K alloy demonstrates a liquid alloying diffusion mechanism that enables dendrite-free Na anodes. The extremely small Na fluctuation and flexible Na-K bonds in the liquid alloy phase bring isotropic nucleation of Na upon electroplating/stripping, which is directly observed by in situ optical imaging. Spontaneously, serving as (de)sodiation buffer with faster electron/mass transportation, the liquid inertia also provides attenuated concentration distribution of Na. Significantly, a record capacity retention of approximately 100% is rendered when coupled with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathodes (ca. 2 mg cm-2) over 500 cycles at 10C, advancing the possibility of using liquid alloy for stable metal anodes beyond Na storage systems.",

The composite (donated as N-PB@CMK) has high electrical conductivity, low resistance, and ultrahigh specific surface, which can lead to high capacitive contribution ratios.

Even cycling at 1 A g-1, the reversible capacity can be measured to 102 mAh g-1 and exhibit stability over a long cycle. In situ Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were further measured to illustrate the phase transition of crystal structure along with the extraction/insertion processes of Na+ ions.

A simple and energy efficient strategy to develop electrodes for SIBs with a high charge/discharge rate is highly desirable. Here we demonstrate that by surface modification of Ge, using electroless deposition in SbCl3/ionic liquids, the stability and performance of the anode can be improved. This is due to the formation of GexSb1-x at the surface leading to better diffusion of Na, and the formation of a stable twin organic and inorganic SEI which protects the electrode. By judicious control of the surface modification, an improvement in the capacity to between 50% and 300% has been achieved at high current densities (0.83-8.4 A g(-1)) in an ionic liquid electrolyte NaFSI-[Py1,4]FSI.

However, its rapid capacity degradation, mainly caused by huge volume changes during lithium insertion/extraction processes, remains a significant challenge to its practical application. Engineering Si anodes with abundant free spaces and stabilizing them by incorporating carbon materials has been found to be effective to address the above problems. Using sodium chloride (NaCl) as a template, bubble sheet-like carbon film supported core-shell Si/C composites are prepared for the first time by a facile magnesium thermal reduction/glucose carbonization process. The capacity retention achieves up to 93.6% (about 1018 mAh g(-1)) after 200 cycles at 1 A g(-1). The good performance is attributed to synergistic effects of the conductive carbon film and the hollow structure of the core-shell nanospheres, which provide an ideal conductive matrix and buffer spaces for respectively electron transfer and Si expansion during lithiation process. This unique structure decreases the charge transfer resistance and suppresses the cracking/pulverization of Si, leading to the enhanced cycling performance of bubble sheet-like composite.",

It is known that the reduction of electrolyte anions such as bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI-) causes Mg surface passivation, resulting in poor electrochemical performance for Mg-ion batteries. We reveal that the addition of sodium cations (Na+) in Mg-ion electrolytes can fundamentally alter the interfacial chemistry and structure at the Mg anode surface. The molecular dynamics simulation suggests that Na+ cations contribute to a significant population in the interfacial double layer so that TFSI- anions are excluded from the immediate interface adjacent to the Mg anode. As a result, the TFSI- decomposition is largely suppressed so does the formation of passivation layers at the Mg surface. This mechanism is supported by our electrochemical, microscopic, and spectroscopic analyses. The resultant Mg deposition demonstrates smooth surface morphology and lowered overpotential compared to the pure Mg(TFSI)2 electrolyte.",

        "abstract": "Despite the fulfilling advancement in preparing two-dimensional layered transition-metal-dichalcogenides (TMDs)-based hybrid architectures, most methods lie on additional-template-based procedures for obtaining the expected structure. Here, we present a self-template and in-situ synchronous selenization/vulcanization strategy for the synthesis of flowerlike hierarchical MoS0.74Se1.26/N-doped carbon (MoS0.74Se1.26/NC) microspheres by morphology-preserved thermal transformation of Mo-polydopamine precursor. Introducing element S into MoSe2 crystal structure can enhance the electron and ion transportation and lift the ability of MoSe2 to store Na+; the presence of Se can expand the interlayer spacing in contrast to MoS2. Moreover, carbon composition can also favor the electrical conductivity and the rigid micro/nanostructure is better for preventing the stacking of MoS0.74Se1.26 nanoflakes. The Mo-polydopamine-derived MoS0.74Se1.26/NC hybrid exhibits much better performance as the sodium-ion battery (SIB) anode than MoS2/NC and MoSe2/NC counterparts, confirming that the advanced electrode material can be attained via the rationalization of the synthetic method.

However, their service life, especially at high specific density, is hindered by the undesirable reversibility of metal anodes, owing to the inhomogeneous ion distribution and awkward charge transfer dynamics at the electrode/electrolyte interface. In this work, it is well demonstrated that ferroelectric phase BaTiO3 reinforced Na3 Zr2 Si2 PO12 ceramic electrolyte can deconcentrate the distribution of charge transfer and self-accelerate Na+ migration at the Na/Na3 Zr2 Si2 PO12 interface upon cycling, realizing a compact Na deposition morphology together with a high critical current density (1.05 mA cm-2 at ambient conditions). Assembled symmetric cells based on the proposed composite electrolyte render stable cycling up to 1000 h at 0.3 mA cm-2 . Specifically, the all solid-state sodium metal batteries paired with Na3 V1.5 Cr0.5 (PO4 )3 cathode material can deliver a capacity of 95 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 and maintain 84.4% of the initial capacity after 400 cycles.

We have investigated the relative performance of novel intrinsically metallic h-BSi3 (BS) sheet as an anode for SIBs, compared to LIBs, through Density Functional Theory studies. Our calculations show that BS has higher chemisorption interactions with Na than Li atoms while drawing substantial electron densities from both, turning them into cations. BS is able to reach a high specific capacity of 1127.62 mA h g-1 for Na, while only as half of that for Li, at ambient temperatures ranging 300-600 K. The moderate sodiation (0.77 V) and lithiation (0.79 V) voltages facilitate BS to prevent the SEI layer formation, metal plating and harmful dendrite growth and to maintain good energy density. BS retains good electronic and ionic conductivities after hosting both Na and Li adatoms, while the former diffuses with about as half the barriers as those of the latter, supporting faster charge/discharge rate and greater preservation of storage capacities in high current densities when BS is used as an anode in SIBs. Na adsorptions cause relatively lower structural deformations to BS, and refrain from forming clusters, leading to good cyclic stability. The superior electrochemical performance of Na, thus, makes BS a potential anode material for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Titanates have been widely reported as anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, their wide temperature suitability and cycle life remain fundamental issues that hinder their practical application. Herein, a novel hollow Na2Ti3O7 microsphere (H‐NTO) with a unique chemically bonded NTO/C(N) interface is reported. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the NTO/C(N) interface stabilizes the crystal structure, and the optimized interface enables the H‐NTO anode to stably operate for 80 000 cycles in a conventional ester electrolyte with negligible capacity loss. Optimizing the electrolyte allows the H‐NTO electrode to cycle stably for 200 calendar days without capacity degradation at −40 °C. The excellent cycling stability is attributed to the NTO/C(N) interface and the stable solid electrolyte interphase formed by the highly adaptable electrolyte/electrode interface. Titanate exhibits solvent co‐intercalation behavior in ether‐based electrolytes, and its robust structure ensures that it can adapt to large volume changes at low temperatures. This study provides a unique perspective on the long‐cycle mechanism of titanate anodes and highlights the critical importance of manipulating the interfacial chemistry in SIBs, including the material and electrode/electrolyte interfaces.",

Here we report a nanoarchitecture strategy of biodegradable, biocompatible, and naturally abundant cellulose derivative (cellulose acetate, CA) and chitosan (CH) biopolymer-based nano-porous electrospun composite electrolyte (ECE) for flexible and wearable ss-SIBs. A simple combination of electrospinning and solution casting was utilized to fabricate mechanically robust (13.76 MPa), thin-film (0.067 mm), highly flexible, and high room temperature Na-ion conductive (1.04 x 10-4 S.cm-2) ECE. Lower activation energy (Ea = 0.13 eV) indicates easy charge carrier diffusion ability of as prepared ECE. The electrochemical stability window (ESW = 3.45 V) of ECE is studied by the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) with respect to stainless steel and sodium metal electrodes. Uniform galvanostatic Na plating and stripping at room temperature is observed over 900 hrs at 0.5 mA•cm-2 current density in symmetric (Na|ECE|Na) cell performance, this underscores impressive electrochemical stability and compatibility with sodium metal. Using Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) as cathode, ECE, and Na metal as anode in the full cell, specific discharge capacity of 83 mA×h×g-1 at room temperature was attained at 0.1 C rate, highlighting the practical applicability of the nanostructured electrospun composite electrolyte for flexible and wearable ss-SIBs.\n \n Keywords\n \n Cellulose acetate, chitosan, electrospun, solid-state sodium-ion battery, specific discharge capacity.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted great interest for large‐scale electric energy storage in recent years. However, anodes with long cycle life and large reversible capacities are still lacking and therefore limiting the development of SIBs. Here, a bulk Bi anode with surprisingly high Na storage performance in combination with glyme‐based electrolytes is reported. This study shows that the bulk Bi electrode is gradually developed into a porous integrity during initial cycling, which is totally different from that in carbonate‐based electrolytes and ensures facile Na+ transport and structural stability. The achievable capacity of bulk Bi in the NaPF6‐diglyme electrolyte is high up to 400 mAh g−1, and the capacity retention is 94.4% after 2000 cycles, corresponding to a capacity loss of 0.0028% per cycle. It exhibits two flat discharge/charge plateaus at 0.67/0.77 and 0.46/0.64 V, ascribed to the typical two‐phase reactions of Bi ↔ NaBi and NaBi ↔ Na3Bi, respectively. The excellent performance is attributed to the unique porous integrity, stable solid electrolyte interface, and good electrode wettability of glymes. This interplay between electrolyte and electrode to boost Na storage performance will pave a new pathway for high‐performance SIBs.",

The interspacing between the graphene layers in the anthracite structure also increased after the heat treatment. Besides, on extending the heating time, the anthracite structure became more disordered than the samples heated for shorter times. Therefore, the intercalation ability of Na+ ions in the anthracite structure increased, and the sample heated at 900 °C for 6 hours exhibited the highest reversible capacity of up to 160 mA h g−1 with adequate capacity retention after 100 cycles at C/10 rate.",

        "abstract": "The lithium and sodium storage performances of SnS anode often undergo rapid capacity decay and poor rate capability owing to its huge volume fluctuation and structural instability upon the repeated charge/discharge processes. Herein, a novel and versatile method is described for in situ synthesis of ultrathin SnS nanosheets inside and outside hollow mesoporous carbon spheres crosslinked reduced graphene oxide networks. Thus, 3D honeycomb-like network architecture is formed. Systematic electrochemical studies manifest that this nanocomposite as anode material for lithium-ion batteries delivers a high charge capacity of 1027 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 100 cycles. Meanwhile, the as-developed nanocomposite still retains a charge capacity of 524 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles for sodium-ion batteries. In addition, the electrochemical kinetics analysis verifies the basic principles of enhanced rate capacity. The appealing electrochemical performance for both lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries can be mainly related to the porous 3D interconnected architecture, in which the nanoscale SnS nanosheets not only offer decreased ion diffusion pathways and fast Li+ /Na+ transport kinetics, but also the 3D interconnected conductive networks constructed from the hollow mesoporous carbon spheres and reduced graphene oxide enhance the conductivity and ensure the structural integrity.",

        "abstract": "Sodium metal anodes are highlighted as the most potential candidates for next-generation batteries due to their high theoretical capacity (1166 mAh/g), low electrochemical potential (-2.71 V vs standard hydrogen electrode), and cheaper material cost. However, practical application of sodium metal batteries is limited due to the uneven solid electrolyte interphase layer and insignificant coulombic efficiency. Designing a protective coating layer as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase layer on a sodium metal anode is one of the main approaches to maintaining the homogenous deposition and long-term stability during the process of electrochemical plating/stripping. Herein, a protective layer of (Na-Sn) alloy and Na-Cl insulator was formed by establishing the spontaneous self-alloying reaction. Most importantly, the proposed Na-Sn metal alloy layer has high ionic conductivity, stable chemical/electrochemical interphase, and robustness to enhance the homogenous Na ion deposition and prevent the uncontrollable sodium dendrites. Based on these effects, using the Na-Sn alloy symmetric cell exhibits the stable electrochemical performance (500 h at 2 mA/cm2 & 2 mAh areal capacity). The Full cell was assembled using the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode and Na-Sn alloy over sodium metal anode in diglyme electrolyte, showing excellent cycle stability up to 100 cycles at 1 C rate and discharge capacity of 168 mAh/g at 0.1 C rate. This work presents a new technique to produce a uniform Na ion deposition and safe dendrites-free sodium metal batteries (SMBs).",

This study proposes a novel conversion reaction using CoSnO3 (CSO) nanocubes uniformly wrapped in graphene nanosheets, which are fabricated using a wet-chemical strategy followed by low-temperature heat treatment. This optimized composite exhibits durable cyclability and high-rate capability, attributing to the strong interaction between reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and CSO through its surface oxygen moieties. It develops a facile conversion reaction route, thereby leading to SnO2 formation during charging. This interactive phenomenon further contributes to improving the reaction kinetics and restraining the volume expansion during cycling. This study may provide a facile approach to address irreversible conversion of high-capacity oxide materials toward advanced SIBs.",

        "abstract": "H2Ti3O7 was prepared as a single phase material by ionic exchange from Na2Ti3O7. The complete ionic exchange was confirmed by (1)H and (23)Na solid state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). The atomic positions of H2Ti3O7 were obtained from the Rietveld refinement of powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and neutron diffraction experimental data, the latter collected at two different wavelengths to precisely determine the hydrogen atomic positions in the structure. All H(+) cations are hydrogen bonded to two adjacent [Ti3O7](2-) layers leading to the gliding of the layers and lattice centring with respect to the parent Na2Ti3O7. In contrast with a previous report where protons were located in two different positions of H2Ti3O7, 3 types of proton positions were found. Two of the three types of proton are bonded to the only oxygen linked to a single titanium atom forming an H-O-H angle close to that of the water molecule. H2Ti3O7 is able to electrochemically insert Na(+). The electrochemical insertion of sodium into H2Ti3O7 starts with a solid solution regime of the C-centred phase. Then, between 0.6 and 1.2 inserted Na(+) the reaction proceeds through a two phase reaction and a plateau at 1.3 V vs. Na(+)/Na is observed in the voltage-composition curve. The second phase resembles the primitive Na2Ti3O7 cell as detected by in situ PXRD. Upon oxidation, from 0.9 to 2.2 V, the PXRD pattern remains mostly unchanged probably due to H(+) removal instead of Na(+), with the capacity quickly fading upon cycling. Conditioning H2Ti3O7 for two cycles at 0.9-2.2 V before cycling in the 0.05-1.6 V range yields similar specific capacity and better retention than the original Na2Ti3O7 in the same voltage range.",

The thermodynamic and kinetic stability of monolayer MBenes at room temperature was confirmed by AIMD simulations and phonon spectra. We investigated the potential of two-dimensional MBenes (V, Cr, Mn) as lithium/sodium ion anode electrode materials. Research shows that MBenes have inherent metallic properties, and their mechanical properties indicate that MBenes have high Young's modulus and anisotropy, low diffusion potential and low open-circuit voltage, with outstanding rate performance and good chemical stability in practical applications. In addition, functionalization tends to strongly reduce electrochemical performance and should be avoided as much as possible in experiments. These interesting findings fully demonstrate that the predicted monolayer MBenes are attractive anode materials for lithium/sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Numerous studies have reported that the enhancement of rate capability of carbonaceous anode by heteroatom doping is due to the increased diffusion‐controlled capacity induced by expanding interlayer spacing. However, percentage of diffusion‐controlled capacity is less than 30% as scan rate is larger than 1 mV s−1, suggesting there is inaccuracy in recognizing principle of improving rate capability of carbonaceous anode. In this paper, it is found that the heteroatom doping has little impact on interlayer spacing of carbon in bulk phase, meaning that diffusion‐controlled capacity is hard to be enhanced by doping. After synergizing with tensile stress, however, the interlayer spacing in subsurface region is obviously expanded to 0.40 nm, which will increase the thickness of accessible subsurface region at high current density. So SRNDC‐700 electrodes display a high specific capacity of 160.6 and 69.5 mAh g−1 at 20 and 50 A g−1, respectively. Additionally, the high reversibility of carbon structure insures ultralong cycling stability and hence attenuation of SRNDC‐700 is only 0.0025% per cycle even at 10 A g−1 for 6000 cycles. This report sheds new insight into mechanism of improving electrochemical performance of carbonaceous anode by doping and provides a novel design concept for doping carbon.",

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional layered materials commonly face hindered electron transfer and poor structure stability, thus limiting their application in high-rate and long-term sodium ion batteries. In the current study, we adopt finite element simulation to guide the rational design of nanostructures. By calculating the von Mises stress distribution of a series of carbon materials, we find that the hollow biconcave structure could effectively alleviate the stress concentration resulting from expansion. Accordingly, we propose a biconcave-alleviated strategy based on the Aspergillus niger-derived carbon (ANDC) to construct ANDC/MoS2 with a hollow biconcave structure. The ANDC/MoS2 is endowed with an excellent long-term cyclability as an anode of sodium ion batteries, delivering a discharge capacity of 496 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1. A capacity retention rate of 94.5% is achieved, an increase of almost seven times compared with the bare MoS2 nanosheets. Even at a high current density of 5 A g-1, a reversible discharge capacity around 400 mAh g-1 is maintained after 300 cycles. ANDC/MoS2 could also be used for efficient lithium storage. By using in situ TEM, we further reveal that the hollow biconcave structure of ANDC/MoS2 has enabled stable and fast sodiation/desodiation.",

We investigated the mechanism of Na intercalation by XRD and achieved capacitance of ∼100 F/g at 0.2 mV/s.

        "abstract": "We report the fabrication of 3D flower-like MoS2 nanosheets arrays on carbon cloth as a binder-free anode for sodium ion battery. Ultrathin and conformal TiO2 layers are used to modify the surface of MoS2 by atomic layer deposition. The electrochemical performance measurements demonstrate that the ALD TiO2 layer can improve the cycling stability and rate capability of MoS2. The MoS2 nanosheets with 0.5-nm TiO2 coating electrode show the highest initial discharge capacity of 1392 mA h g-1 at 200 mA g-1, which is increased by 53% compared with that of bare MoS2. After 150 cycles, the capacity retention rate of the TiO2-coated MoS2 achieves 75.8% of its second cycle's capacity at 200 mA h g-1 in contrast to that of 59% of pure MoS2. Furthermore, the mechanism behind the experimental results is revealed by ex situ scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterizations, which confirms that the ultrathin TiO2 modifications can prevent the structural degradation and the formation of SEI film of MoS2 electrode.",

Arborescent Zn3Nb2O8 particles (Zn3Nb2O8-A) and stump-like Zn3Nb2O8 particles (Zn3Nb2O8-B) have been prepared by solid-state and solvothermal methods, respectively. Benefiting from the microsized stump-like structure and the exposure of the (110) facet, Zn3Nb2O8-B delivers superior long-term cycling stability with a 139.6% capacity retention (291.8 mA h g−1) over 650 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 and a large reversible specific capacity of 91.4 mA h g−1 at 4.0 A g−1 in lithium-ion batteries. Furthermore, the Zn3Nb2O8-B electrode exhibits outstanding cycling stability (100.1 mA h g−1 with 94.5% capacity retention after 400 cycles at 0.5 A g−1) in sodium-ion batteries. The excellent electrochemical performance of the stump-like Zn3Nb2O8-B materials can be attributed to the exposure of the (110) facet, enlarged interlayer spacing, small charge transfer resistance, and high pseudocapacitive contribution.

        "abstract": "The low-cost and profusion of sodium reserves make Na-ion batteries (NIBs) a potential candidate to lithium-ion batteries for grid-scale energy storage applications. NaVOPO4 has been recognized as one of the most promising cathodes for high-energy NIBs, owing to their high theoretical capacity and energy density. However, their further application is hindered by the multiphase transition and conductivity confinement. Herein, we proposed a feasible, one-step hydrothermal synthesis to regulate the synthesis of α-NaVOPO4 with controlled morphologies. The electrochemical properties of the NaVOPO4 electrode can be significantly enhanced taking Ketjen black (KB) as the optimized conductive carbon. Besides, combining with the nanocrystallization and construction of the conductive framework via high-energy ball milling, taking KB as the conductive carbon, the as-prepared NaVOPO4/5%KB exhibits superior Na-storage performance (140.2 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C and a capacity retention of 84.8% over 1000 cycles at 10 C) to the original NaVOPO4 (128.5 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C and a capacity retention of 83.1% over 1000 cycles at 10 C). Moreover, the aqueous full cell with NaTi2(PO4)3 as the anode delivers a capacity of 114.7 mA h g-1 at 0.2 C (141 W h kg-1 energy density) and 80.6% capacity retention over 300 cycles at 5 C. The excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the nanosized structural and enhanced interfacial effect, which could be rewarding to construct electron transportation tunnels, thus speeding up the Na+-diffusion kinetics. The modified strategy provides an efficient approach to intensify the electrochemical performance, which exhibits potential application of the NaVOPO4 cathode for NIBs.",

Challenges with material properties remain, however, particularly with regards the performance of anodes. We report a rapid, energy-efficient ionic liquid synthesis method for mixed phase Na2Ti3O7 and Na2Ti6O13 rods. This method is based on a novel phase-transfer route which produces pure functional materials via a dehydrated IL. The structure of the synthesised materials was characterised using powder X-ray diffraction, which confirms the formation of a mixed Na2Ti3O7 and Na2Ti6O13 phase, with majority Na2Ti3O7 phase, in contrast to previous synthesis methods. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy analysis reveals a rod morphology, with an average diameter and length of 87 nm ± 3 nm and 1.37 μm ± 0.07 μm, respectively. The initial discharge and charge capacity of Na2Ti3O7 nanorods were measured as 325.20 mA h g-1 and 149.07 mA h g-1, respectively, at 10 mA g-1 between 0.01-2.5 V.

In this work, by means of density functional theory (DFT) computations, we demonstrate that two-dimensional (2D) Ti2PTe2 monolayer is a promising candidate for this application. The exfoliation of Ti2PTe2 monolayer from its experimentally known layered bulk phase is feasible due to the moderate cohesive energy. Different from many binary 2D transitions metal chalcogenides (TMCs) that are semiconducting, Ti2PTe2 monolayer is metallic with considerable electronic states at the Fermi level. Remarkably, Ti2PTe2 monolayer has a considerably high theoretical capacity of 280.72 mA h g−1, a rather small Na diffusion barrier of 0.22 eV, and a low average open circuit voltage of 0.31 eV. These results suggest that Ti2PTe2 monolayer can be utilized as a promising anode material for SIBs with high power density and fast charge/discharge rates.",

        "abstract": "Solvent molecule tuning is used to alter the redox potentials of solvents or ion‐solvent binding energy for high‐voltage or low‐temperature electrolytes. Herein, an electrolyte design strategy that effectively suppresses solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) dissolution and passivates highly‐reactive metallic Na anode via solvent molecule tuning is proposed. With rationally lengthened phosphate backbones with ─CH2─ units, the low‐solvation tris(2‐ethylhexyl) phosphate (TOP) molecule effectively weakens the solvation ability of carbonate‐based electrolytes, reduces the free solvent ratio, and enables an anion‐enriched primary Na+ ion solvation sheath. The decreased free solvent and compact lower‐solubility interphase established in this electrolyte prevent electrodes from continuous SEI dissolution and parasitic reactions at both room temperature (RT) and high temperature (HT). As a result, the Na/Na3V2(PO4)3 cell with the new electrolyte achieves impressive cycling stability of 95.7% capacity retention after 1800 cycles at 25 °C and 62.1% capacity retention after 700 cycles at 60 °C. Moreover, the TOP molecule not only maintains the nonflammable feature of phosphate but also attains higher thermal stability, which endows the electrolyte with high safety and thermal stability. This design concept for electrolytes offers a promising path to long‐cycling and high‐safety sodium metal batteries.",

As the anode for SIBs, the cream roll-like MnS/NSCT composite has delivered the best electrochemical performance to date (the highest capacity of 550.6 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1, the highest capacity of 447.0 mA h g-1 after 1400 cycles at 1000 mA g-1, and the best rate performance of 319.8 mA h g-1 at 10 000 mA g-1). Besides, according to several in situ and ex situ techniques, the sodium storage mechanism of MnS/NSCTs is mainly from a conversion reaction, and the superior electrochemical performance of MnS/NSCTs is mainly attributed to the unique cream roll-like structure. More importantly, this simple method may be feasible for other anode materials, which will greatly promote the development of SIBs.",

To tackle these issues, carbon-coated WS2 (NTs-WS2@C) nanocomposites were prepared through a facile synthesis method that involved precipitating a carbon precursor (20% sucrose) on WS2 nanotubes, followed by annealing treatment under an argon environment. Thanks to the presence of highly conductive and mechanically robust carbon on the outer surface, NTs-WS2@C nanocomposites show improved electrochemical performance compared with bare NTs-WS2. After 60 cycles at 80 mA g-1 current density, the cells display high capacities of 305 mAh g-1 in LIBs and 152 mAh g-1 in SIBs, respectively. As the current density increases to 600 mA g-1, it provides specific capacities of 209 and 115 mAh g-1, correspondingly. The enhanced electrochemical performance in LIBs and SIBs is primarily attributed to the synergistic effects of the tubular architecture of WS2, carbon network and stable nanocomposite structure, which can effectively constrain volume variation during the metal ions intercalation/deintercalation processes.",

The optimized material exhibits an initial capacity and energy density comparable with lithium-ion batteries. The reversible anionic redox behavior and charge compensation mechanism of NaNFM@NMO were analyzed and verified by soft X-ray absorption spectrum and in situ X-ray absorption spectrum. Due to the intrinsic stability of the tunnel structure, excellent air stability and highly reversible structure evolution of the NaNFM@NMO cathode material are achieved, which are confirmed by contact angle test, rigorous aging test, and in situ X-ray diffraction. More importantly, the NaNFM@NMO cathode demonstrates a great match with the nonpresodiated hard carbon anode and shows excellent electrochemical performance of the full cell. Additionally, such a strategy could be also applied to modify P2-type cathodes, showing superior universality and good prospects in industrialized production. Overall, the proposed strategy could improve air stability while remaining interfacial and bulk stable simultaneously and will open up a whole new field for the optimization of other electrode materials.",

The CoSe nanoparticles are in situ produced by reacting the cobalt species in the metal-organic frameworks with selenium (Se) powder, and the organic species are simultaneously converted into nitrogen-doped carbon material in an inert atmosphere at temperatures between 700 and 900 °C for 4 h. For the composite synthesized at 800 °C, the carbon framework has a relatively higher extent of graphitization, with high nitrogen content (17.65%). Furthermore, the CoSe nanoparticles, with a size of around 15 nm, are coherently confined in the mesoporous carbon framework. When evaluated as novel anode materials for sodium ion batteries, the CoSe/C composites exhibit high capacity and superior rate capability. The composite electrode delivers the specific capacities of 597.2 and 361.9 mA h g-1 at 0.2 and 16 A g-1, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Electrochromic batteries as emerging smart energy devices are highly sought after owing to their real-time energy monitoring through visual color conversion. However, their large-scale applicability is hindered by insufficient capacity, inadequate cycling stability, and limited color variation. Herein, a flexible Zn-ion electrochromic battery (ZIEB) was assembled with sodium vanadate (VONa+) cathode, ion-redistributing hydrogel electrolyte, and Zn anode to address these challenges. The electrolyte contains anchored -SO3- and -NH3+, which facilitates ionic transportation and prevents Zn dendrite formation by promoting orientated Zn2+ deposition on the Zn (002) surface. The ZIEB exhibits a continuous reversible color transition, ranging from fully charged orange to mid-charged brown and drained green. It also demonstrates a high specific capacity of 302.4 mAh·g-1 at 0.05 A·g-1 with a capacity retention of 96.3% after 500 cycles at 3 A·g-1. Additionally, the ZIEB maintains stable energy output even under bending, rolling, knotting, and twisting.

        "abstract": "Developing anode-free batteries is the ultimate goal in pursuit of high energy density and safety. It is more urgent for sodium (Na)-based batteries due to its inherently low energy density and safety hazards induced by highly reactive Na metal anodes. However, there is no electrolyte that can meet the demanding Na plating-stripping Coulomb efficiency (CE) while resisting oxidative decomposition at high voltages for building stable anode-free Na batteries. Here, a \"liquid-in-solid\" electrolyte design strategy is proposed to integrate target performances of liquid and solid-state electrolytes. Breaking through the Na+ transport channel of Na-containing zeolite molecular sieve by ion-exchange and confining aggregated liquid ether electrolytes in the nanopore and void of zeolites, it achieves excellent high-voltage stability enabled by solid-state zeolite electrolytes, while inheriting the ultra-high CE (99.84%) from liquid ether electrolytes. When applied in a 4.25 V-class anode-free Na battery, an ultra-high energy density of 412 W h kg-1 (based on the active material of both cathodes and anodes) can be reached, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art graphite||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 lithium-ion batteries. Furthermore, the assembled anode-free pouch cell exhibits excellent cycling stability, and a high capacity retention of 89.2% can be preserved after 370 cycles.

However, low capacity, poor rate capability, and cycling stability of existing anodes significantly hinder the practical applications of SIBs. Herein, ultrathin two-dimensional SnS2 nanosheets (3-4 nm in thickness) are synthesized via a facile refluxing process toward enhanced sodium storage. The SnS2 nanosheets exhibit a high apparent diffusion coefficient of Na(+) and fast sodiation/desodiation reaction kinetics. In half-cells, the nanosheets deliver a high reversible capacity of 733 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1), which still remains up to 435 mAh g(-1) at 2 A g(-1). The cell has a high capacity retention of 647 mA h g(-1) during the 50th cycle at 0.1 A g(-1), which is by far the best for SnS2, suggesting that nanosheet morphology is beneficial to improve cycling stability in addition to rate capability. The SnS2 nanosheets also show encouraging performance in a full cell with a Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode. In addition, the sodium storage mechanism is investigated by ex situ XRD coupled with high-resolution TEM.

Herein, hierarchical MoS2 /C composite microspheres were constructed by facile template-free self-assembly sulfurization plus post-carbonization. Cross-linked MoS2 nanosheets and outer carbon layer are organically combined together to form composite microspheres with diameters of 400-500 nm. Due to enhanced electrical conductivity and good structural stability, the MoS2 /C composite microspheres exhibit substantially improved Li/Na-ion storage performance. Compared to unmodified MoS2 , MoS2 /C composite microspheres deliver higher Li/Na-ion storage capacity (Li+ : 1017 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 and Na+ : 531 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 ), as well as better rate capability (Li+ : 434 mA h g-1 at 1 Ag-1 and Na+ : 102 mA h g-1 at 1 Ag-1 ) and capacity retention (Li+ : 902 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles and Na+ : 342 mA h g-1 over 100 cycles). The superior Li/Na-ion storage performance is mainly attributed to the unique porous microsphere architecture with increased electrode/electrolyte interfaces and more diffusion paths for Li/Na ion insertion. Additionally, the carbon coating can not only improve the electronic conductivity, but also suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides.",

Herein, the library of such non‐negligible factors is extended by targeting an alloying‐type bismuth anode well known for its high volumetric capacity for both Li+ and Na+ storage, showing that the mechanical property of key reaction intermediates also plays a role in differentiating its Na+ versus Li+ storage mechanisms. Applying spatially and temporally resolved in situ transmission electron microscopy to Li+ and Na+ storage within bismuth, it not only demonstrates the thermodynamic similarity in a step‐wise phase transition but also discloses its kinetic distinctions in morphological and structural integrities determined by Young's modulus of involving reaction intermediates and spatial configuration, which well accounts for the surprisingly observed superior Na+ storage performance of Bi anode compared to the inferior Li+ storage.

Utilizing 3D‐printed (3DP) anode materials with hybrid sodium storage mechanism and elevated mass loading is promising yet poorly explored. Herein, the design of a prototype ternary composite is reported, MoS2@Bi/N‐doped carbon, as a sodium storage candidate to achieve high reversible capacity (604 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 with an initial output of 709 mAh g−1) and outstanding rate capability (169.6 mAh g−1 at 15 A g−1), outperforming the state‐of‐the‐art reports. This is realized by delicate structural and interfacial engineering of the composite anode, markedly synergizing the conversion‐typed MoS2, alloy‐typed Bi, and adsorption‐typed N‐doped carbon. Theoretical simulations and operando instrumental analysis elaborate the reasons of the boosted electrochemical performance. Encouragingly, a fully 3DP SIB affording an areal mass loading of up to 11.7 mg cm−2 is demonstrated, retaining a capacity of 114 mAh g−1 at 1.0 A g−1.

The structure and morphology of the compound was studied using XRD, IR, TGA and SEM. Using cyclic voltammetry, the electrochemical characteristics of the organometallic framework in alkaline electrolytes 1, 10 M NaOH, as well as in saturated aqueous electrolyte NaClO4, were evaluated. It has been established that the studied compound does not give a satisfactory electrochemical response in aqueous electrolytes (both in alkaline and neutral media) due to the strong degradation of the electrode material, which is associated with the high solubility of this MOF representative. Cyclic voltammetric studies showed the presence of two redox processes due to the release of metallic zinc from an electrolyte solution, where two forms of zinc exist in equilibrium (the ZnEDTA complex and the free zinc cation). Therefore, we concluded, it is not possible to use this material as an anode for water-based sodium-ion batteries in contrary to a published research study.",

        "abstract": "\nNowadays, hard carbon is one of the most promising anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries. However, the Na‐storage performance of hard carbon varies for different precursors and synthetic processes due to disparities in the dopant content, dimensions, and categories of defects, graphitic domains, which lead to controversial explanations for the energy storage mechanism. Herein, self‐freestanding membrane of cellulose‐derived carbon fibers is presented, delivering a reversible Na‐storage capacity of 330 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1 due to abundant ordered graphitic zones with enlarged interlayer spacings around 0.39 ± 0.03 nm. Benefiting from a robust solid electrolyte interphase layer rich in NaF nanocrystals, the membrane also holds a superior rate capability of 100 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 and long‐term cycling stability with capacity retention of 82.6% at 1.5 A g−1 for 4000 cycles. A clear sodiation behavior of Na+ intercalation into enlarged carbon graphitic layers at the slope step above 0.10 V and Na cluster evolution in the micropores at the plateau step around 0.01–0.10 V is disclosed by high‐resolution element mapping microscopy, different from the accepted mechanism of Na+ intercalation into graphitic layers at the plateau step.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon attracts considerable attention as an anode material for sodium‐ion batteries; however, their poor rate capability and low realistic capacity have motivated intense research effort toward exploiting nanostructured carbons in order to boost their comprehensive performance. Ultramicropores are considered essential for attaining high‐rate capacity as well as initial Coulombic efficiency by allowing the rapid diffusion of Na+ and inhibiting the contact of the electrolyte with the inner carbon surfaces. Herein, hard carbon nanosheets with centralized ultramicropores (≈0.5 nm) and easily accessible carbonyl groups (CO)/hydroxy groups (OH) are synthesized via interfacial assembly and carbonization strategies, delivering a large capacity (318 mA h g−1 at 0.02 A g−1), superior rate capability (145 mA h g−1 at 5.00 A g−1), and approximately 95% of reversible capacity below 1.00 V. Notably, a new charge model favoring fast capacitive sodium storage with dual potential plateaus is proposed. That is, the deintercalation of Na+ from graphitic layers is manifested as the low‐potential plateau region (0.01−0.10 V), contributing to stable insertion capacity; meanwhile, the surface desodiation process of the CO and OH groups corresponds to the high‐potential plateau region (0.40−0.70 V), contributing to a fast capacitive storage.",

        "title": "Design of Sodium Titanate Nanowires as Anodes for Dual Li,Na Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "The bottleneck in the implementation of hybrid lithium-sodium-ion batteries is the lack of anode materials with a desired rate capability. Herein, we provide an in-depth examination of the Li-storage performance of sodium titanate nanowires as negative electrodes in hybrid Li,Na-ion batteries. Titanate nanowires were prepared by a simple and reproducible hydrothermal method. At a low reaction pressure, the well-isolated nanowires are formed, while by increasing the reaction pressure from 2 to 30 bar, the isolated nanowires tend to bundle. In nanowires, the local coordinations of Na and Ti atoms deviate from those in Na2Ti3O7 and Na2Ti6O13 and slightly depend on the reaction pressure. During the annealing at 350 °C, both Na and Ti coordinations undergo further changes. The nanowires are highly defective, and they easily crystallize into Na2Ti6O13 and Na2Ti3O7 phases. The lithium storage properties are evaluated in lithium-ion cells vs. lithium metal anode and titanate electrodes fabricated with PVDF and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binders. The Li-storage by nanowires proceeds by a hybrid capacitive-diffusive mechanism between 0.1 and 2.5 V, which enables to achieve a high specific capacity. Sodium titanates accommodate Li+ by formation of mixed lithium-sodium-phase Na2−xLixTi6O13, which is decomposed to the distinct lithium phases Li0.54Ti2.86O6 and Li0.5TiO2. Contrary to lithium, the sodium storage is accomplished mainly by the capacitive reactions, and thus the phase composition is preserved during cycling in sodium ion cells. The isolated nanowires outperform bundled nanowires with respect to rate capability.",

        "title": "Stable Cycling of BiSbSe1.5Te1.5 Conversion-Alloying Anodes",
        "abstract": "Conversion-alloying anodes based on metal-selenides/tellurides have been explored extensively during the past decade for usage in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), in order to increase cell energy density.1,2 Due to the large expansion and contraction during (de)lithiation, however, deterioration due to pulverization is a main hurdle to overcome for stable cycling. Strategies such as nano-structuring and composites have been applied to improve the mechanical stability, but no silver-bullet has yet been found.\n Here we present proof-of-concept for a conversion-alloying based anode BiSbSe1.5Te1.5, a medium high-entropy alloy (MHEA). The main idea is that the increased entropy can enhance the mechanical properties via solid solution strengthening. The MHEA was synthesized using high-energy ball milling to get a single phase (R3m), which was subsequently used as the anode active material, and this without compositing with any carbon material, in contrast to previously reported Se/Te-based alloys.3,4 As a result, our half-cells (Li//MHEA) were able to attain stable cycling with high capacity (420 mAh g-1), agreeable capacity retention (84%), and coulombic efficiency (>99%) for 100 cycles at C/5 rate (Figure 1).5 The formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) was inferred by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data, showing reduced charge transfer resistance with cycling. Furthermore, operando XRD showed reversibility of the initial phases during (de)lithiation. We furthermore believe that moving from MHEAs to “proper” HEAs might further enhance the mechanical properties and stabilize the structure for even longer duration.\n Figure 1: a) Charge-discharge curves and b) galvanostatic cycling of Li//BiSbSe1.5Te1.5.\n \n References\n \n \n \n \n Li, L., Zhao, J., Zhao, H. & Mao, J.

        "abstract": "Bismuth is a promising anode material for state‐of‐the‐art rechargeable batteries due to its high theoretical volumetric capacity and relatively low working potential. However, its charge storage mechanism is unclear, hindering further improvement of the cell performance. Here, using in situ transmission electron microscopy and X‐ray diffraction techniques as well as theoretical analysis, it is found that a large anisotropic volume expansion of 142% occurs along the z‐axis largely due to the alloy reaction during sodiation, significantly reducing the electrochemical performance of bismuth electrodes. To address this problem, ultrathin few‐layer bismuthene with a large aspect ratio is rationally synthesized, and can relieve the expansion strain along the z‐axis. A free‐standing bismuthene/graphene composite electrode with tunable thickness achieves a strikingly stable and high areal sodium storage capacity of 12.1 mAh cm−2, which greatly exceeds that of most reported electrode materials. The clarification of the charge storage mechanism and the superior areal capacity achieved should facilitate the development of bismuth‐based high‐performance anodes for practical electrochemical energy‐storage applications.",

Furthermore, even at a large current density of 2 C, a high capacity of 168 mAh g(-1) can still remain, which is much higher than that of pristine NiS2 materials. The enhancement in electrochemical properties might be attributed to the synergetic effect endowed by high conductivity of graphene and novel structure of the electrode material.

However, the continuous capacity attenuation arising from the huge volumetric strain during sodiation/desodiation impedes practical applications. Here, we report a \"sandwich-type\" carbon confinement strategy that entraps cobalt ditelluride (CoTe2) nanocrystals between two carbon layers. Porous cellulose-derived fibres were employed as the inner carbon framework to construct fast conductive circuits and provide an abundant site for anchoring CoTe2 nanocrystals. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-derived carbon layers act as carbon armour to encapsulate CoTe2 nanocrystals, inhibiting their volume change and structural pulverization during repeated sodium intercalation/deintercalation. Benefiting from the exquisite structural design, the N-C@CoTe2@C electrode exhibits excellent cycling stability for over 3000 cycles at 2.0 A g-1 and rate performance (113.8 mA h g-1 at 5.0 A g-1).

However, the capacity degradation caused by the volumetric variation during battery discharge/charge hinders the practical application. Herein, guided by the DFT calculation, Sb/Fe2S3 was fabricated by annealing Fe and Sb2S3 mixed powder. Next, Sb/Fe2S3 was blended with 15 wt % graphite by ball milling, yielding nano-Sb/Fe2S3 anchored on an exfoliated graphite composite (denoted as Sb/Fe2S3-15%). When applied as an anode of SIBs, Sb/Fe2S3-15% delivered reversible capacities of 565, 542, 467, 366, 285, and 236 mA h g-1 at current rates of 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 A g-1, respectively, surpassing most of the Sb-based anodes. The co-existence of highly conductive Fe2S3 and Sb minimizes the polarization of the anode. Our experiments proved that the Sb and Fe2S3 phases were reversible during discharge/charge cycling, and the exfoliated graphite can accelerate the Na+ diffusion and e- conduction.

To overcome the drawbacks, herein the successful fabrication of TiS2 @N,S-codoped C (denoted as TiS2 @NSC) through a chemical vapor reaction between Ti-based metal-organic framework (NH2 -MIL-125) and carbon disulfide (CS2 ) is demonstrated. The C─N bonds enhance the electronic/ionic conductivity of the TiS2 @NSC electrode, while the C─S bonds provide extra sodium storage capacity, and both polar bonds synergistically suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides. Consequently, the TiS2 @NSC electrode demonstrates outstanding cycling stability and rate performance, delivering reversible capacities of 418/392 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 2/5 A g-1 . Ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope analyses reveal that TiS2 undergoes an intercalation-conversion ion storage mechanism with the generation of metallic Ti in a deeper sodiation state, and the pristine hexagonal TiS2 is electrochemically transformed into cubic rock-salt TiS2 as a reversible phase with enhanced reaction kinetics upon sodiation/desodiation cycling.

A long-term cycling performance of the ultrathin Na2Ti2O4(OH)2 nanosheets of 120 mA h g(-1) at ∼10C was retained after 500 cycles for sodium-ion batteries, and 150 mA h g(-1) at ∼1C was kept after 500 cycles for lithium-ion batteries. By comparison, the Na-ion storage performance is much better than the Li-ion storage performance of the Na2Ti2O4(OH)2 nanosheets anode, because of the existence of Na in the Na2Ti2O4(OH)2 host.",

        "abstract": "Red phosphorus (P) have been considered as one of the most promising anode material for both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and (NIBs), because of its high theoretical capacity. However, natural insulating property and the large volume expansion of red P during cycling lead to poor cyclability and low rate performance, which prevents its practical application. Here, we significantly improves both lithium storage and sodium storage performance of red P by confining nanosized amorphous red P into the mesoporous carbon matrix (P@CMK-3) using a vaporization-condensation-conversion process. The P@CMK-3 shows a high reversible specific capacity of ∼ 2250 mA h g(-1) based on the mass of red P at 0.25 C (∼ 971 mA h g(-1) based on the composite), excellent rate performance of 1598 and 624 mA h g(-1) based on the mass of red P at 6.1 and 12 C, respectively (562 and 228 mA h g(-1) based on the mass of the composite at 6.1 and 12 C, respectively) and significantly enhanced cycle life of 1150 mA h g(-1) based on the mass of red P at 5 C (500 mA h g(-1) based on the mass of the composite) after 1000 cycles for LIBs. For Na ions, it also displays a reversible capacity of 1020 mA h g(-1) based on the mass of red P (370 mA h g(-1) based on the mass of the composite) after 210 cycles at 5C. The significantly improved electrochemical performance could be attributed to the unique structure that combines a variety of advantages: easy access of electrolyte to the open channel structure, short transport path of ions through carbon toward the red P, and high ionic and electronic conductivity.",

        "abstract": "Metal oxides, as promising electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries, usually need to be formed by exposure to oxygen, which usually thermally corrodes the carbon material with which they are compounded, reducing their flexibility and electrical conductivity. Herein, we present for the first time a preoxidation-assisted mechanism to prepare bismuth oxide and carbon nanofibers (Bi2O3@C-NFs) by electrospinning, using Bi2S3 nanorods as multifunctional templates. The bismuth could be oxidized by C═O bonds formed through the cyclization reaction in the high-temperature calcination process, effectively avoiding thermal corrosion of carbon in oxygen atmosphere at high temperature. More importantly, the uniformly distributed Bi2O3 nanodots and longitudinal tunnels are formed inside the S- and N-doped carbon nanofibers with the continuous diffusion of Bi generated from the decomposition of Bi2S3 nanorods and the conversion to Bi─O bonds with C═O bonds being broken. Benefiting from the structural and composition merits arising from preoxidation, Bi2O3@C-NFs self-supporting anodes show high specific capacity (439 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1), superior rate performance (243 mAh g-1 at a current density of 20 A g-1), and outstanding cycling stability (211 mAh g-1 after 2000 cycles at 5 A g-1).

        "abstract": "How to green synthesize and construct MoP anode electrode materials with advanced structures for sodium-ion batteries still faces great challenges. Herein, a TiO2-coated MoP/phosphorus doped carbon (MoP@TiO2/P-C) nanorod with a new structure is constructed using TiO2-coated Mo-MOF as the precursor through an in situ topological conversion technique. In the synthesis process, the traditional highly toxic PH3 phosphorus is avoided. TEM results reveal that TiO2 nanoparticles are distributed at the interface between the MoP core and the P-doped carbon shell, which breaks the density of the carbon layer and facilitates ion transport. The GITT results demonstrate the fact that the diffusion coefficient of sodium ions is remarkably improved by two orders of magnitude due to the presence of TiO2. Notably, TiO2 can effectively cushion volume expansion with an almost negligible rate of 13%, allowing cells to manifest a high discharge capacity of 419 mA h g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 current density and exceptional stability where the specific capacity remains constant for 10 000 cycles at a high density of 10 A g-1 (∼81 seconds for one charging).

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfides are considered as one of the most potential anode materials in sodium-ion batteries due to their high capacity, low cost, and rich resources. Among plenty of options, molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) has been the focus of research due to the graphene-like layered structure and unique electrochemical properties. Importantly, an abnormal capacity increase phenomenon was observed in the MoS2 anode of sodium-ion batteries, but the mechanisms involved are still unclear. In this study, by analyzing the composition and structure of the material after a different number of cycles, we confirmed that the (002) plane shows a significant expansion of the interlayer spacing after the sodium ion insertion process and a phase transformation from the hexagonal phase MoS2 (2H-MoS2) to the trigonal phase MoS2 (1T-MoS2). Moreover, the ratio of 1T-MoS2 presented an increasing trend during cycling. The dual-phase co-existence leads to enhanced electrical conductivity, higher Na affinity, and higher Na+ mobility, thus increasing the capacity. Our work provides a new perspective on the anomalous electrochemical behavior of sulfide anodes during long-term cycling.",

        "abstract": "To make sodium-ion batteries a realistic option for everyday energy storage, a practicable method is to enhance the kinetics of Na+ reactions through the development of structurally stable electrode materials. This study utilizes ternary Sn-based dichalcogenide (SnS1.5 Se0.5 ) in the design of electrode material to tackle several issues that adversely hinder the performance and longevity of sodium-ion batteries. First, the incorporation of Se into the SnS structure enhances its electrical conductivity and stability. Second, the ternary composition restricts the formation of intermediates during the desodiation/sodiation process, resulting in better electrode reaction reversibility. Finally, SnS1.5 Se0.5 lowers the diffusion barrier of Na, thereby facilitating rapid and efficient ion transport within the electrode material. Moreover, nitrogen and sulfur dual-doped carbon (NS-C) is used to enhance surface chemistry and ionic/electrical conductivity of SnS1.5 Se0.5 , leading to a pseudocapacitive storage effect that presents a promising potential for high-performance energy storage devices. The study has successfully developed a SnS1.5 Se0.5 /NS-C anode, exhibiting remarkable rate capability and cycle stability, retaining a capacity of 647 mAh g-1 even after 10 000 cycles at 5 A g-1 in half-cell tests. In full-cell tests, Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 //SnS1.5 Se0.5 /NS-C delivers a high energy density of 176.6 Wh kg-1 . In addition, the Na+ storage mechanism of SnS1.5 Se0.5 /NS-C is explored through ex situ tests and DFT calculations. The findings suggest that the ternary Sn-based dichalcogenides can considerably enhance the performance of the anode, enabling efficient large-scale storage of sodium. These findings hold great promise for the advancement of high-performance energy storage devices for practical applications.",

Restricted by the raw materials and devices, the controlling of their morphology is a major challenge.

The formation mechanisms are illustrated as follows: 1) the “orient induction” to evoke “vine style” growth mechanism of ZnO; 2) the “dissolution–precipitation” of Ni; and 3) the “surface adsorption self‐limited” of Cu. Subsequently, the degree of graphitization, interlayer distance, and special surface area are investigated in detail. 1D structure from 700 °C as anode displays a high Na‐storage capacity of 301.2 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 200 cycles and 107 mAh g−1 at 5.0 A g−1 after 5000 cycles.

        "title": "Sodium Halide-Based Solid Electrolyte with High Ionic Conductivity",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered one of the most prominent alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) because of the abundance of sodium resources on Earth. However, compared to Li, Na has a heavier atomic weight (23 g mol–1 vs. 6.9 g mol–1) and higher standard potential, leading to lower volumetric and gravimetric energy density of SIBs than LIBs. The energy density of state-of-the-art room-temperature SIBs is in the range of 75 – 165 W h kg–1 or 250 – 375 W h L–1. To increase the energy density of SIBs, Na metal is proposed to be used as the anode material due to its superior theoretical specific capacity (1166 mA h g–1). To tackle the safety challenges brought by using Na metal, applying solid electrolytes (SEs) has been proposed to be an effective strategy. Despite the tremendous progress that has been made in the past decades, the progress and application are still in the infancy, experiencing numerous challenges for sodium solid-state batteries due to inherently low room-temperature ionic conductivity, interface complications, and fabrication.\n Inorganic halide-based SEs have emerged as a game changer because of their fast-conducting characteristics, adequate thermodynamic stability, great deformability, and good oxidative stability.1 Moreover, halide-based SEs are generally stable against moisture owing to their positive hydrolysis reaction energy. However, most of the studied halide-based SEs are based on the Li-ion system, with only a few based on the Na-ion system. Moreover, despite halide-based Na SEs theoretically having high ionic conductivity,2 experimental obtained samples have much lower ionic conductivities compared to their Li counterparts (usually < 0.1 mS cm–1). Therefore, developing halide-based SEs with high Na+ ionic conductivity is crucial for Na ASSBs. We recently identified a new Na halide-based SE with a room temperature Na+ ionic conductivity over 1 mS cm–1. The activation energy is also as low as 0.23 eV. Interestingly, the material shows a mixed amorphous and crystalline phase, and its ionic conductivity decreases with the increase of the crystalline phase. The ionic conductivity of > 1 mS cm–1 is already comparable to some organic liquid electrolytes and thus is sufficient for many practical applications. The developed strategy has the potential to be applied to other halide-based SEs to improve their ionic conductivity, promoting the development of SIBs.\n (1) Huang, J.; Wu, K.; Xu, G.; Wu, M.; Dou, S.; Wu, C.

However, it still needs great efforts to develop electrode materials with ultrafast gravimetric and volumetric Na-storage performance, due to difficult balance between Na-ion diffusion kinetics and pressing density of materials. In this work, Bi2Se3/graphene composites, synthesized by a selenization reaction, are investigated as anode materials for SIBs. Na-ion storage mechanism of Bi2Se3 should be attributed to a combined conversion-alloying one by a series of ex situ measurements. In the composites, Bi2Se3 particles with an average diameter of 100 nm are uniformly dispersed onto graphene with strong interfacial interaction. Despite their nanoscale size, the pressing density of Bi2Se3/graphene composite could still reach a high value of 2.07 g/cm3. Therefore, the composites can deliver a high gravimetric specific capacity of 346 mAh/g and volumetric specific capacity of 716 mAh/cm3 at a current density of 0.1 A/g. Remarkably, the composites exhibit an ultrafast Na-storage capability and a negligible capacity fading with the increasing of current density from 0.2 to 5 A/g. Even at 10 A/g (≈30 C), the composites still possess a gravimetric capacity of 183 mAh/g and volumetric capacity of 379 mAh/cm3 with ultrastable cyclability up to 1000 cycles.

        "abstract": "Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are important anode materials in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high theoretical capacities, abundant resources, and cost-effectiveness. However, issues such as the low conductivity and large volume variation of TMO bulk materials during the cycling process result in poor electrochemical performance. Nanosizing and compositing with carbon materials are two effective strategies to overcome these issues. In this study, spherical MnFe2O4@xC nanocomposites composed of MnFe2O4 inner cores and tunable carbon shell thicknesses were successfully prepared and utilized as anode materials for SIBs. It was found that the property of the carbon shell plays a crucial role in tuning the electrochemical performance of MnFe2O4@xC nanocomposites and an appropriate carbon shell thickness (content) leads to the optimal battery performance. Thus, compared to MnFe2O4@1C and MnFe2O4@8C, MnFe2O4@4C nanocomposite exhibits optimal electrochemical performance by releasing a reversible specific capacity of around 308 mAh·g−1 at 0.1 A·g−1 with 93% capacity retention after 100 cycles, 250 mAh·g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 with 73% capacity retention after 300 cycles in a half cell, and around 111 mAh·g−1 at 1.0 C when coupled with a Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode in a full SIB cell.",

        "abstract": "Bismuth (Bi) has emerged as a promising candidate for sodium-ion battery anodes because of its unique layered crystal structure, superior volumetric capacity, and high theoretical gravimetric capacity. However, the large volume expansion and severe aggregation of Bi during the alloying/dealloying reactions are extremely detrimental to cycling stability, which seriously hinders its practical application. To overcome these issues, we propose an effective synthesis of composite materials, encapsulating Bi nanoparticles in N,S co-doped carbon nanoribbons and composites with carbon nanotubes (N,S-C@Bi/CNT), using Bi2S3 nanobelts as templates. The uniform distribution of Bi nanoparticles and the structure of carbon nanoribbons can reduce the diffusion path of ions/electrons, efficiently buffer the large volume change and prevent Bi from aggregating during cycles. As expected, the N,S-C@Bi/CNT electrode shows superior sodium storage performance in half cells, including a high specific capacity (345.3 mA h g-1 at 1.0 A g-1), long cycling stability (1000 cycles), and superior rate capability (336.0 mA h g-1 at 10.0 A g-1).",

        "abstract": "The search for advanced electrode materials to solve slow ion diffusion and poor conductivity issues has spurred the development of fast‐charging sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a 2D metallic anode, KCu4S3, is reported expertly crafted using a KSCN molten salt approach, laying the foundation for fast‐charging SIBs. It is found that the mixed metal‐valence states within this compound provide substantial advantages, particularly in enhancing the high‐rate capability and ensuring long‐term durability. The mechanism that appears to facilitate these benefits can be traced to the formation of NaCu2S2 intermediate, which assist in electron transfer during Na+ (de)intercalation. In situ observations confirm the sodiation products of NaCu2S2 and sodium polysulfide can recover to the original phase upon desodiation. Such distinctive characteristics endow KCu4S3 with remarkable electrochemical performances, including an impressive capacity of 355 mAh g−1 at 20 A g−1 and 100% capacity retention within 3000 cycles. Moreover, the full cell exhibits a high energy density of 332 Wh kg−1 and retains 92% of its capacity across 150 cycles at 1 A g−1.

        "abstract": "The transition phenomenon involving copper replacing the transition metal elements within transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) is a recent and unique observation in the context of sodium ion batteries (SIBs) where TMCs serve as anodes. Fundamental understanding of the driving forces and kinetics governing this transition is crucial for elucidating the sodium storage mechanism in TMCs anodes. Herein, cobalt disulfide (CoS2) has been chosen as a representative anode. It is revealed that the transition behavior of copper replacing cobalt during the cycling originates from chemical/electrochemical dual‐driving forces. The chemical driving force emanates from the interaction between Cu+ dissolved in the electrolyte and the resulting sodium polysulfide products. The reaction extent is intricately linked to the surface roughness of the copper collector. The electrochemistrical driving force is effectively elucidated through the application of the Hard‐Soft‐Acid‐Base theory. Multiple charaterization techniques, such as Solid‐state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) have been employed to confirm that cobalt exists as cation instead of metal after transition. This research offers a novel perspective understanding the transition behavior exhibited by CoS2, with potential wider implications for understanding analogous behaviors in other metal sulfide anodes.",

        "abstract": "Carbonaceous materials have great potential for applications as anodes of alkali-metal ion batteries, such as Na-ion batteries and K-ion batteries (NIB and KIBs). We conduct an in situ study of the electrochemically driven sodiation and potassiation of individual carbon nanofibers (CNFs) by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The CNFs are hollow and consist of a bilayer wall with an outer layer of disordered-carbon (d-C) enclosing an inner layer of crystalline-carbon (c-C). The d-C exhibits about three times volume expansion of the c-C after full sodiation or potassiation, thus suggesting a much higher storage capacity of Na or K ions in d-C than c-C. For the bilayer CNF-based electrode, a steady sodium capacity of 245 mAh/g is measured with a Coulombic efficiency approaching 98% after a few initial cycles. The in situ TEM experiments also reveal the mechanical degradation of CNFs through formation of longitudinal cracks near the c-C/d-C interface during sodiation and potassiation. Geometrical changes of the tube are explained by a chemomechanical model using the anisotropic sodiation/potassiation strains in c-C and d-C. Our results provide mechanistic insights into the electrochemical reaction, microstructure evolution and mechanical degradation of carbon-based anodes during sodiation and potassiation, shedding light onto the development of carbon-based electrodes for NIBs and KIBs.",

However, its inherent thermodynamic instability often presents unparalleled challenges in phase control and stabilization. Here, a molecular intercalation strategy is developed to synthesize thermally stable 1T-rich MoSe2 , covalently bonded to an intercalated carbon layer (1TR /2H-MoSe2 @C). Density functional theory calculations uncover that the introduced ethylene glycol molecules not only serve as electron donors, inducing a reorganization of Mo 4d orbitals, but also as sacrificial guest materials that generate a conductive carbon layer. Furthermore, the C─Se/C─O─Mo bonds encourage strong interfacial electronic coupling, and the carbon layer prevents the restacking of MoSe2 , regulating the maximum 1T phase to an impressive 80.3%. Consequently, the 1TR /2H-MoSe2 @C exhibits an extraordinary rate capacity of 326 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 and maintains a long-term cycle stability up to 1500 cycles, with a capacity of 365 mAh g-1 at 2 A g-1 .

The triumph of lithium-ion batteries is due to their much higher energy density compared to the other rechargeable battery systems. The high energy density along with superior cycling stability became possible because of the use of oxide cathodes in lithium-ion cells. There are only three families of cathodes for practical lithium-ion cells, and all the three of them are oxides: layered, spinel, and polyanion oxide cathodes.\n As we move forward with vehicle electrification and renewable energy storage, multiple parameters, such as cost, energy density, power density, cycle life, safety, and environmental impact, need to be balanced. Among them, cost along with sustainability and supply chain issues is at the forefront. Cathode is the most expensive component in the cell. The oxide cathodes will still dominate the field, but with fierce efforts to reduce or eliminate less abundant and expensive metals in the cathode. This presentation will focus on eliminating the most expensive cobalt from layered oxide cathodes, then reducing the next expensive nickel in oxide cathodes, and finally replacing/eliminating lithium with sodium in oxide cathodes.\n Reducing or eliminating cobalt in layered oxide cathodes by increasing the nickel content helps to increase the energy density and reduce the cost, but cathodes with high nickel contents are plagued with cycle, thermal, and air instabilities along with severe scale-up challenges. This presentation will focus on overcoming these challenges with controlled compositional and synthesis designs along with a profound understanding of the intricacies involved with the aid of advanced characterization methodologies. Particularly, issues, such as what different dopants really do, which dopant does what, and which is critical between surface reactivity and crack, in stabilizing high-nickel cathodes will be discussed. The dependence of surface reorganization/degradation pathways on electrolytes and the importance of electrolyte composition and high-voltage stability in stabilizing the cathode-electrolyte interphase will be presented with both graphite and lithium-metal anodes.\n Finally, elimination of both cobalt and lithium while reducing the nickel content much further down will be described with sodium batteries based on layered oxide cathodes. Tailored electrolyte designs that provide long-life sodium cells with suppressed dendrites and enhanced safety will be presented.",

Their greatly enhanced electrochemical performances can be attributed to the superior intrinsic conductivities and richer redox reactions, comparative to mono metal chalcogenides. To employ various binary metals comprising selenides (B-TMSs) for SIBs, discovery of a simplistic, scalable and universal synthesis approach is highly desirable. Herein, a simple, facile, and comprehensive strategy to produce various combinations of nanostructured B-TMSs is presented. As a proof of concept, optimized, high surface area bearing, and hierarchical nanosheets of iron-nickel selenide (FNSe), iron-cobalt selenide, and nickel-cobalt selenide are produced and employed in SIBs. These B-TMSs exhibit adequately high energy capacities, excellent rate capabilities, and an extraordinarily stable life of 2600 cycles. As far as it is known, it is the first work to discuss sodium storage of FNSe, so various in situ and ex situ battery analyses are carried out to probe the sodium storage mechanism. When employed in sodium full batteries, these B-TMSs present reasonably high reversible specific capacities even after 100 cycles. Overall, the presented strategy will pave the way for facile synthesis of numerous binary transition metal chalcogenides that are the potential materials for energy storage and conversion systems.",

Estimates are made for the materials` impact on production speed or dryer length. Within the experimental part, water‐based slurries of the same composition are mixed using different active materials according to identical procedure and the viscosity is compared. When drying at a constant drying rate (0.75 g m‐2 s‐1), Lithium Iron Phosphate electrodes with different areal capacities (1‐3 mAh cm‐2) are shown to have the highest adhesion.

However, Na-DIBs are generally subject to poor rate capability and cycling stability for the lack of suitable anodes to accommodate large Na+ ions. Herein, we propose a molecular grafting strategy to in situ synthesize tin pyrophosphate nanodots implanted in N-doped carbon matrix (SnP2O7@N-C), which exhibits a high fraction of active SnP2O7 up to 95.6 wt% and a low content of N-doped carbon (4.4 wt%) as the conductive framework.

Further, pairing this anode with an environmentally friendly KS6 graphite cathode yields a SnP2O7@N-C||KS6 Na-DIB, exhibiting an excellent rate capability up to 30 C, good fast-charge/slow-discharge performance and long-term cycling life with a capacity retention of ∼96% after 1000 cycles at 20 C.

        "abstract": "Transition-metal oxides are one of the most promising anode materials for energy storage in lithium- and sodium-ion batteries (LIBs and NIBs, respectively). To improve the electrochemical performance of metal oxides (e.g., Co3 O4 ), such as capacity and cyclability, a convenient strategy (with a metal-organic framework as a template) is introduced to generate Zn- or Ni-doped Co3 O4 . The obtained hollow core-shell nanosized Co3 O4 (denoted as Zn/Ni-Co-Oxide) derived from pyrolyzing zinc or nickel co-doped ZIF-67 (Co(mIm)2 ; mIm=methylimidazole) shows a drastically enhanced capacity of 1300 mAh g-1 at a high current density of 5000 mA g-1 , compared with that of pristine cobalt oxide (800 mAh g-1 ) in LIBs. A zinc-doped Zn-Co-Oxide demonstrates a stable capacity of 1600 mAh g-1 at 1000 mA g-1 for 700 cycles and an excellent performance in full coin cells (cycled with LiNi0.5 Co0.3 Mn0.2 O2 ). Moreover, NIB tests show a stable capacity of 300 mAh g-1 for more than 250 cycles.",

        "title": "Built‐In Electric Field of In Situ Formed Artificial Interface Layer Induces Fast and Uniform Sodium‐Ions Transmission to Achieve a Long‐Term Stable Sodium Metal Battery Under Harsh Conditions",
        "abstract": "Sodium metal batteries have emerged as potential rivals to lithium‐ion batteries. Nevertheless, maintaining a stable sodium metal anode under harsh conditions (current density >10 mA cm−2) is extremely challenging. The primary issue is the highly reactive sodium metal continuously reacts with the electrolyte to form a thick and loose solid electrolyte film. The tip effect causes sodium ions (Na+) accumulated in the bulge resulting in uneven deposition. In this paper, a unique artificial interfacial layer (Ag nanoparticles distributed in NaClO4‐based matrix) is prepared on the surface of a metallic sodium anode using in situ displacement reaction. Ag particles arranged at the bottom of the artificial layer act as effective nucleation sites helping Na+ deposit uniformly, while the built‐in electric field formed between Ag in the middle/top of the artificial layer and the sodium accelerates the migration of Na+ in the interfacial layer during the deposition and reduce the polarization. Such important properties further allow the steady operation of modified sodium metal batteries in very harsh conditions. The symmetric battery achieves reversible stripping/plating for over 1000 h under high current density (10 mA cm−2). Moreover, the full cell coupled with a high‐loading Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode (20 mg cm−2) presents a stable cycle performance.",

        "abstract": "Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have emerged as a technological game-changer. Due to the rising price of lithium and the environmental concerns LIBs pose, their use is no longer viable. Sodium (Na) may be the best contender among the alternatives for replacing lithium. Conventional graphite has a limited capacity for Na storage. Hence, α-graphyne, an allotrope of carbon, was studied here as a potential anode material for Na-ion batteries (NIBs), employing density functional theory. In-plane Na atom adsorption results in a semi-metallic to metallic transition of α-graphyne. Electronic transport calculations show an increase in current after Na adsorption in graphyne. The successive adsorption of Na atoms on the surface of graphyne leads to a theoretical capacity of 1395.89 mA h g−1, which is much greater than graphite. The average open circuit voltage is 0.81 V, which is an ideal operating voltage for NIBs. Intra- and inter-hexagon Na diffusions have very low energy barriers of 0.18 eV and 0.96 eV, respectively, which ensure smooth operation during charge/discharge cycles. According to this study, the α-graphyne monolayer thus has the potential to be employed as an anode in NIBs.",

        "abstract": "Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2 ), a 2D-layered compound, is regarded as a promising anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its attractive theoretical capacity and low cost. The main challenges associated with MoS2 are the low rate capability suffering from the sluggish kinetics of Na+ intercalation and the poor cycling stability owning to the stack of MoS2 sheets. In this work, a unique architecture of bundled defect-rich MoS2 (BD-MoS2 ) that consists of MoS2 with large vacancies bundled by ultrathin MoO3 is achieved via a facile quenching process. When employed as anode for a SIB, the BD-MoS2 electrode exhibits an ultrafast charge/discharge due to the pseudocapacitive-controlled Na+ storage mechanism in it. Further experimental and theoretical calculations show that Na+ is able to cross the MoS2 layer by vacancies, not only limited to diffusion along the layer, thus realizing a 3D Na+ diffusion with faster kinetics. Meanwhile, the bundling architecture reduces the stack of sheets with a superior cycle life illustrating the highly reversible capacities of 350 and 272 mAh g-1 at 2 and 5 A g-1 after 1000 cycles.",

Herein, novel cubic‐like XFe (X = Co, Ni, Mn) Prussian blue analogs (PBAs), as cathodes materials, are obtained through as‐tuned ionic bonding, delivering improved crystallinity and homogeneous particles size. As expected, Ni‐Fe PBAs show a capacity of 81 mAh g−1 at 1.0 A g−1, mainly resulting from their physical–chemical stability, fast kinetics, and “zero‐strain” insertion characteristics. Considering that the combination of elements incorporated with carbon may increase the rate of ion transfer and improve the lifetime of cycling stability, they are expected to derive binary metal‐selenide/nitrogen‐doped carbon as anodes. Among them, binary Ni0.67Fe0.33Se2 coming from Ni‐Fe PBAs shows obvious core–shell structure in a dual‐carbon matrix, leading to enhanced electron interactions, electrochemical activity, and “metal‐like” conductivity, which could retain an ultralong‐term stability of 375 mAh g−1 after 10 000 loops even at 10.0 A g−1. The corresponding full‐cell Ni‐Fe PBAs versus Ni0.67Fe0.33Se2 deliver a remarkable Na‐storage capacity of 302.2 mAh g−1 at 1.0 A g−1.

Herein, an insight into failure mechanisms within high-voltage layered cathodes is unveiled, while a two-in-one tactic of charge localization and coherent structures is devised to improve structural integrity and Na+ transport kinetics, elucidated by density functional theory calculations. Elevated Jahn-Teller [Mn3+O6] concentration on the particle surface during sodiation, coupled with intense interlayer repulsion and adverse oxygen instability, leads to irreversible damage to the near-surface structure, as demonstrated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and in situ characterization techniques. It is further validated that the structural skeleton is substantially strengthened through the electronic structure modulation surrounding oxygen. Furthermore, optimized Na+ diffusion is effectively attainable via regulating intergrown structures, successfully achieved by the Zn2+ inducer. Greatly, good redox reversibility with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 92.6%, impressive rate capability (86.5 mAh g-1 with 70.4% retention at 10C), and enhanced cycling stability (71.6% retention after 300 cycles at 5C) are exhibited in the P2/O3 biphasic cathode.

Here, a high sustainability cobalt-free P2-Na0.72 Mn0.75 Li0.24 X0.01 O2  (X = Ti/Si) cathode is developed. The outstanding capacity retention and voltage retention after 150 cycles are obtained in half-cells. The finding shows that Ti localizes on the surface while Si diffuses to the bulk of the particles.

Yet, challenges arise due to irreversible reactions and the shuttle effect in contact with electrolytes. This study addresses these issues by confining Se within a microporous carbon derived from non-recyclable plastic waste through a two-step carbonization/activation process. The resulting plastic waste-derived carbon (PWC) serves as a host for Se, forming cathode composites through a melt diffusion process. The cathode electrode was fabricated using a slurry casting method, comprising PWC/Se composite, carbon black, and sodium alginate (8:1:1 mass ratio). The evolution of the porous structure in PWC and its impact on the electrochemical performance of PWC/Se electrode were investigated for different activation temperatures (500, 600, 700, and 800 °C). The study revealed that the structure of PWC activated below 800 °C consists of mainly micropores. Moreover, by increasing the activation temperature, the specific surface area and pore volume increased, and pore size distribution shifted towards mesoporous structure. The Li-Se coin cell made from PWC activated at 600 °C (PWC600) demonstrated superior discharge capacity (640 mAh g–1 at 0.1C after 400 cycles), rate capability, and long cycling stability at higher current densities. The microporous features of PWC600 were crucial for effective Se confinement, lithium-ion diffusion, and charge transfer. This work emphasizes the sustainable development of microporous carbon from upcycled plastic waste as a promising cathode material for high-energy Li-Se batteries.

        "abstract": "Calcium ion batteries (CIBs) are considered as an important candidate for post‐lithium energy storage devices due to their abundance of resources and low cost. However, CIBs still suffer from slow kinetics due to the large solvation structure and high desolvation energy of Ca2+ ions. Here, a solvation regulation strategy based on donor number (DN) is reported to achieve easy‐desolvation and rapid storage of Ca2+ in sodium vanadate (Na2V6O16·2H2O, NVO). Specially, the solvent with a low DN, represented by propylene carbonate (PC), forms the first solvation shell of calcium ions with weak binding energy and small shell structure, which facilitates the migration of Ca2+ in the electrolyte. More importantly, the low DN solvent is preferentially desolvated at the cathode/electrolyte interface, promoting the insertion of Ca2+ into the NVO electrode. Mechanism studies further confirm the highly reversible uptake/release of Ca2+ in the NVO cathode, along with the VO distance change in the coordination structure. Therefore, the NVO cathode achieves high capacity (376 mAh g−1 at 0.3 A g−1) and high‐rate performance (151 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1). The weak solvation effect strategy further improves the electrochemical performance and provides great importance for the design of the long‐term development of CIBs.",

It is found that due to the stronger interaction between ClO4- and TMSI than that of ClO4- and PC/FEC, the ClO4--TMSI complexes tend to accumulate on the surface of the cathode during the charging process, leading to the formation of a stable cathode/electrolyte interface (CEI). In addition, the Si species with excellent electronic insulation ability are distributed in the TMSI-derived CEI film, which is conducive to inhibiting the continuous side reaction of solvents and the growth of the CEI film. As a result, under a current density of 250 mA g-1, the capacity retention of the NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) cathode after 200 cycles in the TMSI-modified electrolyte is 74.4% in comparison to 51.5% of the bare electrolyte (1 M NaClO4/PC/5% FEC). Moreover, the NFM cathode shows better kinetics, with the specific discharge capacity increasing from 22 to 67 mAh g-1 at 300 mA g-1. It also demonstrates greatly improved rate capability, cycling stability, and Coulombic efficiency under various operating conditions, including high temperature (55 °C) and high cutoff voltage (2.0-4.3 V vs Na+/Na).",

        "abstract": "Iron-based mixed polyanion phosphate Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) is recognized as a promising cathode for Sodium-ion Batteries (SIBs) due to its low cost and environmental friendliness. However, its inherent low conductivity and sluggish Na+ diffusion limit fast charge and low-temperature sodium storage. This study pioneers a scalable synthesis of hollow core-shelled Na4Fe2.4Ni0.6(PO4)2P2O7 with tiny-void space (THoCS-0.6Ni) via a one-step spray-drying combined with calcination process due to the different viscosity, coordination ability, molar ratios, and shrinkage rates between citric acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone. This unique structure with interconnected carbon networks ensures rapid electron transport and fast Na+ diffusion, as well as efficient space utilization for relieve volume expansion. Incorporating regulation of lattice structure by doping Ni heteroatom to effectively improve intrinsic electron and Na+ diffusion path and energy barrier, which achieves fast charge and low-temperature sodium storage. As a result, THoCS-0.6Ni exhibits superior rate capability (86.4 mAh g-1 at 25 C). Notably, THoCS-0.6Ni demonstrates exceptional cycling stability at -20 °C with a capacity of 43.6 mAh g-1 after 2500 cycles at 5 C. This work provides a universal strategy to design the hollow core-shelled structure with tiny-void space cathode materials for reversible batteries with fast-charge and low-temperature storage features.",

        "abstract": "The electrochemical charge storage of sodium vanadate (NaV3O8 or NVO) cathodes in aqueous Zn-ion batteries has been hypothesized to be influenced by the inclusion of structural water for facilitating ion transfer in the material. Materials properties considered important (morphology, crystallite and particle size, surface area) are systematically studied herein through investigation of two NVO materials, NaV3O8·0.34H2O [NVO(300)] and NaV3O8·0.05H2O [NVO(500)], with different water content, acicular morphologies with different size and surface area achieved via post-synthesis heat treatment. The electrochemistry of the two materials was evaluated in aqueous Zn-ion cells with 2 M ZnSO4 electrolyte using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic cycling, and rate capability testing. The thinner NVO(300) nanobelts (0.13 μm) demonstrate greater specific capacities and higher effective diffusion coefficients relative to the thicker NVO(500) nanorods. Notably however, while cells containing NVO(500) deliver lower specific capacity, they demonstrate enhanced capacity retention with cycling. The structural changes accompanying oxidation and reduction are elucidated via ex situ X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and operando V K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), where NVO material properties are shown to influence the ion insertion. Operando XAS verified that electron transfer corresponds directly to change in vanadium oxidation state, affirming vanadium redox as the governing electrochemical process.",

The electrochemical tests showed an exceptional performance for the F0N05 sample with the lowest (Ni + Fe) contents, at 5 C (ca. 100 mA h g-1), and good capacity retention after 100 cycles. This excellent behaviour was also evidenced when cycling at -15 °C. These results were confirmed by electrochemical techniques, such as cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy, that evidenced a fast exchange of sodium ions due to a significant capacitive contribution and high apparent diffusion coefficients. Post-mortem analysis of the F0N05 electrodes by XRD showed the reversible insertion and the absence of detrimental P2-O2 and P2-P2' transitions, while XPS spectra demonstrated the reversible redox activity of both transition metals and oxygen.",

Gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) can relieve volatilization of liquid electrolyte, adapt to volume changes in electrodes, and better satisfy the requirements of long-term SMBs. Herein, a dense polyurethane-based GPE modified with polyacrylonitrile is synthesized by rapidly swelling two-component polyurethane/polyacrylonitrile electrospun fiber film. Compared to traditional porous GPEs obtained by swelling porous matrixes, the fiber film provides uniform high Na+ flux inside GPE due to its partial solubility property and ability to dissociate salts. Therefore, it can reduce the polarization effect and induce uniform metal deposition under high current in conjunction with its constructed hybrid N/F-containing solid electrolyte interface (SEI) that possesses low ionic diffusion barrier. The study demonstrates that GPE has an ionic conductivity of 1.816 mS cm-1 at 20 °C and an ion transference number of 0.53. The full battery (NVP/GPE/Na) assembled with this GPE and Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode shows 90.8% capacity retention rate after 1000 cycles at 10 C. Considering the convenient preparation and outstanding electrochemical performances of the obtained GPE, it can also be matched with other electrodes in the future to expand the application of sodium-based batteries.",

In detail, the mixed phase material is able to deliver specific discharge capacities of up to 155 mAh g−1 (18 mA g−1) in the potential range of 2.0–4.3 V. In the narrower potential range of 2.5–4.3 V the material exhibits high average discharge potential (3.4 V versus Na/Na+), exceptional average coulombic efficiencies (>99.9%), and extraordinary capacity retention (90.2% after 601 cycles). The unexplored class of P‐/O‐type mixed phases introduces new perspectives for the development of layered positive electrode materials and powerful Na‐ion batteries.",

The C-NaFePO(4) electrodes are identical (particle size, particle size distribution, surface coating, and active material loading, etc.) to C-LiFePO(4) except that Li ions in C-LiFePO(4) are replaced by Na ions, making them ideal for comparison of thermodynamics and kinetics between C-NaFePO(4) cathode in sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries and C-LiFePO(4) in lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. In this paper, the equilibrium potentials, reaction resistances, and diffusion coefficient of Na in C-NaFePO(4) are systematically investigated by using the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV), and compared to those of the well-known LiFePO(4) cathodes in Li-ion batteries. Due to the lower diffusion coefficient of Na-ion and higher contact and charge transfer resistances in NaFePO(4) cathodes, the rate performance of C-NaFePO(4) in Na-ion batteries is much worse than that of C-LiFePO(4) in Li-ion batteries. However, the cycling stability of C-NaFePO(4) is almost comparable to C-LiFePO(4) by retaining 90% of its capacity even after 100 charge-discharge cycles at a charge-discharge rate of 0.1 C.",

        "abstract": "P2-type layered oxides based on the elements Fe and Mn have attracted great interest as sodium ion battery (SIB) cathode materials owing to their inexpensive metal constituents and high specific capacity. However, they suffer from rapid capacity fading and complicated phase transformations. In this study, we modulate the crystal structure and optimize the electrochemical performances of Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.5O2 by Al doping for Mn or Fe, respectively, and the roles of Al in the enhancement of the rate capability and cycling performance are unraveled. (1) The substitution of Al for Mn or Fe decreases the lattice parameters a and c but enlarges d spacing and lengthens Na-O bonds, which enhances Na+ diffusion and rate capability especially for Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.47Al0.03O2. (2) Al doping reduces the thickness of TMO2 and strengthens TM-O/O-O bonding. This enhances the layered structure stability and the capacity retention. (3) Al doping mitigates Mn3+ and Jahn-Teller distortion, mitigating the irreversible phase transition. (4) Al doping also alleviates the lattice volume variation and the structure strain. This further improves the stability of the layered structure and the cycling performances particularly in the case of Al doping for Fe. The in-depth insights into the roles of Al substitution might be also useful for designing high-performance cathode materials for SIBs through appropriate lattice doping.",

        "abstract": "Rechargeable batteries based on the most abundant elements, such as sodium and iron, have a great potential in the development of cost effective sodium ion batteries for large scale energy storage devices. We report, for the first time, crystallite size dependent structural investigations on maricite-NaFePO4 through X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical simulations. Rietveld refinement analysis on the X-ray diffraction data reveals that a decrease in the unit cell parameters leads to volume contraction upon reduction in the crystallite size. Further, the atomic multiplet simulations on X-ray absorption spectra provide unequivocally a change in the site symmetry of transition metal ions. The high resolution oxygen K-edge spectra reveal a substantial change in the bonding character with the reduction of crystallite size, which is the fundamental cause for the change in the unit cell parameters of maricite-NaFePO4. In parallel, we performed first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations on maricite-NaFePO4 with different sodium ion vacancy concentrations. The obtained structural parameters are in excellent agreement with the experimental observations on the mesostructured maricite-NaFePO4. The volumetric changes with respect to crystallite size are related to the compressive strain, resulting in the improvement in the electronic diffusivity. The nano-crystalline maricite-NaFePO4 with improved kinetics will open a new avenue for its usage as a cathode material in sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Owing to their high redox potential and availability of numerous diffusion channels in metal–organic frameworks, Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are attractive for metal ion storage applications. Recently, vanadium ferrocyanides (VFCN) have received a great deal of attention for application in sodium-ion batteries, as they demonstrate a stable capacity with high redox potential of ~3.3 V vs. Na/Na+. Nevertheless, there have been no reports on the application of VFCN in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). In this work, a facile synthesis of VFCN was performed using a simple solvothermal method under ambient air conditions through the redox reaction of VCl3 with K3[Fe(CN)6]. VFCN exhibited a high redox potential of ~3.7 V vs. Li/Li+ and a reversible capacity of ~50 mAh g–1. The differential capacity plots revealed changes in the electrochemical properties of VFCN after 50 cycles, in which the low spin of Fe ions was partially converted to high spin. Ex situ X-ray diffraction measurements confirmed the unchanged VFCN structure during cycling. This demonstrated the high structural stability of VFCN. The low cost of precursors, simplicity of the process, high stability, and reversibility of VFCN suggest that it can be a candidate for large-scale production of cathode materials for LIBs.",

        "abstract": "To overcome the inherent limitations of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) such as relatively low energy density and operating voltage compared to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), Oxygen redox chemistry is considered to realizing a high-performance battery system. However, oxygen redox commonly accompanied problems such as sluggish kinetics, O2 gas loss, and irreversible structural rearrangement with voltage hysteresis. Herein, we suggest a new model that deviates from the tendency of relying on oxygen redox reaction to realize high capacity. A deep investigation of Na0.6Mg0.2Mn0.8O2 (NMM) and Na0.6Mg0.2Ru0.2Mn0.6O2 (NMRM) is conducted by various analysis tools for the comparison. The highly oxidized Ru5+ lowers the Mn oxidation state in the structure without the Jahn-Teller effect. It drives the increased participation of Mn in the overall electrochemical reaction and the charge compensation by oxygen redox reaction is mostly replaced by the Mn3+/Mn4+ redox pair. A strong covalence of Ru stabilizes the structure and prevents cation migration from TM to Na slap. As a result, even though the specific weight increased, practical capacity was improved by maximizing the participation of Na+ ions, and we confirm that cyclability and rate capability also improved.",

        "abstract": "Mn-based Prussian blue analogues (PBA) are of great interest as a prospective cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high redox potential, easy synthesis and low cost. However, the Jahn-Teller effect and low electrical conductivity of Mn-based PBA causes poor structure stability and unsatisfactory performance during the cycling. Herein, we develop a novel Ni and Cu co-doped K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] cathode via a simple co-precipitation strategy. The doping elements improve the electrical conductivity of Mn-based PBA by reducing the bandgap, as well as suppress the Jahn-Teller effect by stabilizing the framework, as verified by the density functional theory calculations. Simultaneously, the substitution of sodium with potassium in the lattice is beneficial for filling vacancies in the PBA framework, leading to higher average operating voltages and superior structural stability. As a result, the as-prepared Mn-based cathode exhibits excellent reversible capacity (116.0 mAh g-1 at 0.01 A g-1) and superior cycling stability (81.8% capacity retention over 500 cycles at 0.1 A g-1).

        "abstract": "The two‐phase reaction of Na3V2(PO4)3 – Na1V2(PO4)3 in Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is hindered by low electronic and ionic conductivity. To address this problem, a surface‐N‐doped NVP encapsulating by N‐doped carbon nanocage (N‐NVP/N‐CN) is rationally constructed, wherein the nitrogen is doped in both the surface crystal structure of NVP and carbon layer. The surface crystal modification decreases the energy barrier of Na+ diffusion from bulk to electrolyte, enhances intrinsic electronic conductivity, and releases lattice stress. Meanwhile, the porous architecture provides more active sites for redox reactions and shortens the diffusion path of ion. Furthermore, the new interphase of Na2V2(PO4)3 is detected by in situ XRD and clarified by density functional theory (DFT) calculation with a lower energy barrier during the fast reversible electrochemical three‐phase reaction of Na3V2(PO4)3 – Na2V2(PO4)3 – Na1V2(PO4)3. Therefore, as cathode of sodium‐ion battery, the N‐NVP/N‐CN exhibited specific capacities of 119.7 and 75.3 mAh g−1 at 1 C and even 200 C. Amazingly, high capacities of 89.0, 86.2, and 84.6 mAh g−1 are achieved after overlong 10000 cycles at 20, 40, and 50 C, respectively.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are potential replacements for lithium-ion batteries owing to their comparable energy density and the abundance of sodium. However, the low potential and low stability of their cathode materials have prevented their commercialization. Prussian blue analogs are ideal cathode materials for SIBs owing to the numerous diffusion channels in their 3D structure and their high potential vs. Na/Na+. In this study, we fabricated various Fe-V-incorporated hexacyanoferrates, which are Prussian blue analogs, via a one-step synthesis. These compounds changed their colors from blue to green to yellow with increasing amounts of incorporated V ions. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectrum revealed that V3+ was oxidized to V4+ in the cubic Prussian blue structure, which enhanced the electrochemical stability and increased the voltage platform. The vanadium ferrocyanide Prussian blue (VFPB1) electrode, which contains V4+ and Fe2+ in the Prussian blue structure, showed Na insertion/extraction potential of 3.26/3.65 V vs. Na/Na+. The cycling test revealed a stable capacity of ~70 mAh g−1 at a rate of 50 mA g−1 and a capacity retention of 82.5% after 100 cycles. We believe that this Fe-V-incorporated Prussian green cathode material is a promising candidate for stable and high-voltage cathodes for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Aqueous zinc ion batteries are thought to be a new generation of secondary batteries that will replace lithium ion batteries due to their great safety and inexpensive cost. In the cathode materials of aqueous zinc ion batteries with long life and high capacity, abundant active sites and crystal structure stability play an important role. In the present work, the strategy of Na+ intercalation of Fe2VO4 (FVO) is proposed, aiming at the insertion of Na+, which not only enriches the active sites, but also sodium and iron ions act as guest species with the negatively charged VOx lattice to provide strong electrostatic attraction to stabilize the lamellar structure. In terms of electrochemical performance, the discharge specific capacity is 370 mAh g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1, and when the current density is arising 5 A g-1, the specific capacity also reaches 200 mAh g-1 after cycling 2000 with a capacity retention of 99%, which is better than the electrochemical performance of Fe2VO4 (FVO) alone at 50 mAh g-1. The superior electrochemical performance proves that FVO-Na is an ideal cathode material for zinc ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Layered cathodes have been recognized as potential advanced candidates for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), but the poor electrochemical performance has seriously hindered their further development. Herein, an ordered Na2/3[Ni2/9Mg1/9Mn5/9Ti1/9]O2 (NMMT) is designed and investigated as a high-performance cathode for SIBs through the synergistic effect of Mg and Ti codoping. Compared to the single Mg- or Ti-doped materials, NMMT clearly exhibits superstructure ordering diffraction peaks, and neutron diffraction further confirms that the diffraction peaks can be well indexed by a larger supercell P63, rather than the common unit cell P63/mmc by X-ray diffraction (XRD). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy also approves the ordering arrangement. This material shows an obvious capacity activation process during the first cycles, thus delivering 113 mA h g-1 specific capacity at 0.1 C (close to the theoretical value). Excellent rate capability even at 15 C and cycling stability after 500 cycles between 2.0 and 4.3 V can also be achieved, indicating that an ordered cathode is still promising. Besides, a single-phase reaction mechanism is revealed by ex situ/in situ XRD experiments. This study offers some insights into the material design and characterization of layered oxide cathodes for high-performance SIBs in the future.",

        "abstract": "Rechargeable aqueous zinc‐ion batteries are of great potential as one of the next‐generation energy‐storage devices due to their low cost and high safety. However, the development of long‐term stable electrodes and electrolytes still suffers from great challenges. Herein, a self‐separation strategy is developed for an interface layer design to optimize both electrodes and electrolytes simultaneously. Specifically, the coating with an organometallics (sodium tricyanomethanide) evolves into an electrically responsive shield layer composed of nitrogen, carbon‐enriched polymer network, and sodium ions, which not only modulates the zinc‐ion migration pathways to inhibit interface side reactions but also adsorbs onto Zn perturbations to induce planar zinc deposition. Additionally, the separated ions from the coating can diffuse to the electrolyte to affect the Zn2+ solvation structure and maintain the cathode structural stability by forming a stable cathode–electrolyte interface and sodium ions’ equilibrium, confirmed by in situ spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis. Due to these unique advantages, the symmetric zinc batteries exhibit an extralong cycling lifespan of 3000 h and rate performance at 20 mA cm−2 at wide temperatures. The efficiency of the self‐separation strategy is further demonstrated in practical full batteries with an ultralong lifespan over 10 000 cycles from −35 to 60 °C.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion battery technologies are emerging as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries by utilizing the earth abundant, widely distributed, and low-cost sodium resources. Among different types of sodium ion cathodes, transition metal based layered oxide cathodes have a superior edge due to their comparatively higher energy density, lower cost, environment friendly raw materials, and similar synthesis chemistry as the already commercialized lithium-ion battery cathode materials. They also enable the incorporation of iron, an abundant, low-cost, and environmentally benign element, replacing the toxic and expensive cobalt.\n In such layered oxide-based cathodes, transition metals exhibit heterogenous elemental and oxidation state distribution at different depths of the particles (e.g., from the surface to bulk) which can influence the stability, mechanical integrity, and electrochemical performance of these particles to a significant extent. The inherent local structural and electronic state heterogeneity developed in these materials during synthesis can modulate the charge distribution heterogeneity and consequent phase transitions during cycling, ultimately controlling the battery performance.\n In this work, a sodium transition metal layered oxide cathode is synthesized using a co-precipitation method followed by high temperature calcination under different calcination durations. Calcining the material at different conditions lead to the formation of particles with different morphologies and grain growth behavior. Using electron microscopy and Xray diffraction techniques, the grain growth behavior at different stages of calcination is studied. This will guide the design of particles with better morphologies and grain orientation which demonstrate improved electrochemical performance. Transition metal distribution and oxidation state change at different depths of the particles are probed using synchrotron based Xray absorption spectroscopy and three-dimensional Transmission Xray microscopy. The particles are probed at the surface, subsurface and deep into the bulk, which show heterogeneity in the distribution of transition metal oxidation state and provide insight into the phase transitions during calcination. This study can pave the way for better understanding of phase evolution during synthesis and improved design of cathode particle morphology and composition by identifying and eliminating the detrimental phases occurring during different stages of calcination.",

However, achieving high capacity requires overcoming challenges such as oxygen-redox failure, sluggish kinetics, and structural degradation. Herein, we employ an innovative crystal modulation strategy, using Mn-based Na0.72Li0.24Mn0.76O2 as a representative cathode material, which shows that the highly exposed {010} active facets enable an enhanced rate capability (119.6 mAh g-1 at 10C) with fast kinetics. Meanwhile, the reinforced Mn-O bond inhibits excessive oxidation of lattice oxygen and O-O cohesion loss, stabilizing and maintaining a long-enduring reversible oxygen-redox activity (100% high capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.5C and 84.28% retention after 300 cycles at 5C). Time-resolved operando two-dimensional X-ray diffraction reveals the robust structural stability, zero-strain behavior, and suppressed phase transition with ultra-low volume variation during cycling at different rates (0.1C: 1.75%, 1C: 0.31%, 5C: 0.04%). Additionally, the full cell coupled with hard carbon achieves a high energy density of approximately 211 Wh kg-1 with superior performance.

However, on the other hand, the conductivity as well as the available capacity of the polyanion compounds are still poor, which limits their applications; moreover, some polyanion cathode operate at low voltage, which reduces the energy density and raises the cost of the battery system. We here try to summarize the recent progress of polyanion compounds as cathode materials for SIB. These compounds are categorized based on the metal redox couple, including V‐, Cr‐, Mn‐, Fe‐, Co‐, and Ni‐polyanion compounds.

        "abstract": "\n O3-type layered oxide cathodes, such as NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2, have garnered significant attention due to their high theoretical specific capacity while using abundant and low-cost sodium as intercalation species. Unlike the lithium analog (LiNiO2), NaNiO2 (NNO) exhibits poor electrochemical performance resulting from structural instability and inferior Coulomb efficiency. To enhance its cyclability for practical application, NNO was modified by titanium substitution to yield the O3-type NaNi0.9Ti0.1O2 (NNTO), which was successfully synthesized for the first time via a solid-state reaction. The mechanism behind its superior performance in comparison to that of similar materials is examined in detail using a variety of characterization techniques. NNTO delivers a specific discharge capacity of ~190 mAh/g and exhibits good reversibility, even in the presence of multiple phase transitions during cycling in a potential window of 2.0‒4.2 V vs. Na+/Na. This behavior can be attributed to the substituent, which helps maintain a larger interslab distance in the Na-deficient phases and to mitigate Jahn-Teller activity by reducing the average oxidation state of nickel. However, volume collapse at high potentials and irreversible lattice oxygen loss are still detrimental to the NNTO. Nevertheless, the performance can be further enhanced through coating and doping strategies. This not only positions NNTO as a promising next-generation cathode material, but also serves as inspiration for future research directions in the field of high-energy-density Na-ion batteries.",

Here, we propose to coat the cathode of SIBs with Li2ZrO3, which realizes the \"three-in-one\" modification of Li2ZrO3 coating and Li+, Zr4+ co-doping. The synergy of Li2ZrO3 coating and Li+/Zr4+ doping improves both the cycle stability and rate performance, and the underlying modification mechanism is revealed by a series of characterization methods. The doping of Zr4+ increases the interlayer spacing of MF, reduces the diffusion barrier of Na+, and reduces the ratio of Mn3+/Mn4+, thus inhibiting the Jahn-Teller effect. The Li2ZrO3 coating layer inhibits the side reaction between the cathode and the electrolyte. The synergy of Li2ZrO3 coating and Li+, Zr4+ co-doping enhances the stability of lattice oxygen and the reversibility of anionic redox, which improves the cycle stability and rate performance.

As a consequence, the complex phase transitions (O3-O'3-P3-P'3-P3'-O3') of conventional O3-type cathode have been eliminated, and the as-obtained material demonstrates exceptional structural robustness and integrity with an ultra-long cycle life in a quasi-solid-state cell (maintaining 73.2% capacity after 1000 cycles at 2 C). Moreover, the material presents satisfactory air stability, with minimal structural and electrochemical degradation when directly exposed to the air. An Ah-scale pouch cell based on the cathode material is constructed, demonstrating a capacity retention of 83.6% after 500 cycles, signaling substantial promise for commercial applications.",

        "abstract": "P3-layered transition oxide cathodes have garnered considerable attention owing to their high initial capacity, rapid Na+ kinetics, and less energy consumption during the synthesis process. Despite these merits, their practical application is hindered by the substantial capacity degradation resulting from unfavorable structural transformations, Mn dissolution and migration. In this study, we systematically investigated the failure mechanisms of P3 cathodes, encompassing Mn dissolution, migration, and the irreversible P3-O3' phase transition, culminating in severe structural collapse. To address these challenges, we proposed an interfacial spinel local interlocking strategy utilizing P3/spinel intergrowth oxide as a proof-of-concept material. As a result, P3/spinel intergrowth oxide cathodes demonstrated enhanced cycling performance. The effectiveness of suppressing Mn migration and maintaining local structure of interfacial spinel local interlocking strategy was validated through depth-etching X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and in situ synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction. This interfacial spinel local interlocking engineering strategy presents a promising avenue for the development of advanced cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "title": "A mixed iron-manganese based pyrophosphate cathode, Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7, for rechargeable sodium ion batteries.",
        "abstract": "The development of secondary batteries based on abundant and cheap elements is vital. Among various alternatives to conventional lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are promising due to the abundant resources and low cost of sodium. While there are many challenges associated with the SIB system, cathode is an important factor in determining the electrochemical performance of this battery system. Accordingly, ongoing research in the field of SIBs is inclined towards the development of safe, cost effective cathode materials having improved performance. In particular, pyrophosphate cathodes have recently demonstrated decent electrochemical performance and thermal stability. Herein, we report the synthesis, electrochemical properties, and thermal behavior of a novel Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 cathode for SIBs. The material was synthesized through a solid state process. The structural analysis reveals that the mixed substitution of manganese and iron has resulted in a triclinic crystal structure (P1[combining macron] space group). Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements indicate that Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 is electrochemically active with a reversible capacity of ∼80 mA h g(-1) at a C/20 rate with an average redox potential of 3.2 V. (vs. Na/Na(+)). It is noticed that 84% of initial capacity is preserved over 90 cycles showing promising cyclability. It is also noticed that the rate capability of Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 is better than Na2MnP2O7. Ex situ and CV analyses indicate that Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 undergoes a single phase reaction rather than a biphasic reaction due to different Na coordination environment and different Na site occupancy when compared to other pyrophosphate materials (Na2FeP2O7 and Na2MnP2O7). Thermogravimetric analysis (25-550 °C) confirms good thermal stability of Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 with only 2% weight loss. Owing to promising electrochemical properties and decent thermal stability, Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7, can be an attractive cathode for SIBs.",

        "title": "Na3V2(PO4)3-decorated Na3V2(PO4)2F3 as a high-rate and cycle-stable cathode material for sodium ion batteries",
        "abstract": "Since Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) possesses modest volume deformation and three-dimensional ion diffusion channels, it is a potential sodium-ion battery cathode material that has been extensively researched. Nonetheless, NVP still endures the consequences of poor electronic conductivity and low voltage platforms, which need to be further improved. On this basis, a high voltage platform Na3V2(PO4)2F3 was introduced to form a composite with NVP to increase the energy density. In this study, the sol–gel technique was successfully used to synthesize a Na3V2(PO4)2.75F0.75/C (NVPF·3NVP/C) composite cathode material. The citric acid-derived carbon layer was utilized to construct three-dimensional conducting networks to effectively promote ion and electron diffusion. Furthermore, the composites' synergistic effect accelerates the quick ionic migration and improves the kinetic reaction. In particular, NVP as the dominant phase enhanced the structural stability and significantly increased the capacitive contribution. Therefore, at 0.1C, the discharge capacity of the modified NVPF·3NVP/C composite is 120.7 mA h g−1, which is greater than the theoretical discharge capacity of pure NVP (118 mA h g−1). It discharged 110.9 mA h g−1 of reversible capacity even at an elevated multiplicity of 10C, and after 200 cycles, it retained 64.1% of its capacity. Thus, the effort produced an optimized NVPF·3NVP/C composite cathode material that may be used in the sodium ion cathode.",

        "title": "Enabling Anionic Redox Stability of P2‐Na5/6Li1/4Mn3/4O2 by Mg Substitution",
        "abstract": "Oxygen‐based anionic redox reactions have recently emerged as a lever to increase the capacity of Mn‐rich layered oxide cathodes in addition to the charge compensation based on cationic redox reactions for sodium‐ion batteries. Unfortunately, the irreversibility of anionic redox often aggravates irreversible structure change and poor cycling performance. Here, a stable anionic redox is achieved through substituting Na ions by Mg ions in P2‐type Na0.83Li0.25Mn0.75O2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Mg substitution effectively decreases the oxygen chemical potential, causing an improvement in lattice oxygen stability. Moreover, at a highly desodiated state, Mg ions that remain in the lattice and interact with O 2p orbitals can decrease the undercoordinated oxygen and the nonbonded, electron‐deficient O 2p states, facilitating the reversibility of oxygen redox. When cycled in the voltage range of 2.6–4.5 V where only anionic redox occurs for charge compensation, Na0.773Mg0.03Li0.25Mn0.75O2 presents a much better reversibility, giving a 4 times better cycle stability than that of Na0.83Li0.25Mn0.75O2. Experimentally, Na0.773Mg0.03Li0.25Mn0.75O2 exhibits a ≈1.1% volume expansion during sodium insertion/extraction, suggestive of a “zero‐strain” cathode. Overall, the work opens a new avenue for enhancing anionic reversibility of oxygen‐related Mn‐rich cathodes.",

In addition, acid treatment of this material yielded proton stabilized Na(0.44-y)MnO2 (y ∼ 0.23) NWs with a 74% increase in the YM.

        "abstract": "Sodium layered oxides always suffer from sluggish kinetics and deleterious phase transformations at deep-desodiation state (i.e., >4.0 V) in O3 structure, incurring inferior rate capability and grievous capacity degradation. To tackle these handicaps, here, a configurational entropy tuning protocol through manipulating the stoichiometric ratios of inactive cations is proposed to elaborately design Na-deficient, O3-type NaxTmO2 cathodes. It is found that the electrons surrounding the oxygen of the TmO6 octahedron are rearranged by the introduction of MnO6 and TiO6 octahedra in Na-deficient O3-type Na0.83Li0.1Ni0.25Co0.2Mn0.15Ti0.15Sn0.15O2-δ (MTS15) with expanded O-Na-O slab spacing, giving enhanced Na+ diffusion kinetics and structural stability, as disclosed by theoretical calculations and electrochemical measurements. Concomitantly, the entropy effect contributes to the improved reversibility of Co redox and phase-transition behaviors between O3 and P3, as clearly revealed by ex situ synchrotron X-ray absorption spectra and in situ X-ray diffraction. Notably, the prepared entropy-tuned MTS15 cathode exhibits impressive rate capability (76.7% capacity retention at 10 C), cycling stability (87.2% capacity retention after 200 cycles) with a reversible capacity of 109.4 mAh g-1, good full-cell performance (84.3% capacity retention after 100 cycles), and exceptional air stability.

Particularly, their rate performance was significantly improved as well. XRD and XPS tests indicated that La could expand the c-axis of NFM due to its larger ionic radius and thus significantly increased Na+ ion diffusion efficiency, and in addition, Al doping could effectively increase the content of Ni2+ and Mn4+ and thus greatly alleviated the negative Jahn-Teller effect caused by Mn3+. Moreover, consistent with XRD analyses, DFT calculations further substantiated the effectiveness of the La/Al codoping strategy by demonstrating the detailed atom substitution mechanism in the NFM crystal lattice.

In situ X-ray diffraction technology confirmed a redox solid solution and a two-phase reaction mechanism, revealing minor changes in cell volume and slight strain variations after Zr doping, effectively suppressing the structural distortion. Theoretical calculations illustrated that Zr doping largely shrinks the band gap of NMVP, enriches local electron density, and slightly alters the local element distribution and bond lengths. Moreover, full-cells have shown high energy density (259.9 Wh kg-1) and outstanding cycling stability (200 cycles).

O3‐type layered oxides have been considered as one of the most promising cathodes for SIBs.

Here, a series of sodium‐sufficient O3‐type NaNi0.5Mn0.5‐ x Ti x O2 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) cathodes for SIBs is reported and the mechanisms behind their excellent electrochemical performance are studied in comparison to those of their respective end‐members. The combined analysis of in situ X‐ray diffraction, ex situ X‐ray absorption spectroscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy for NaNi0.5Mn0.2Ti0.3O2 reveals that the O3‐type phase transforms reversibly into a P3‐type phase upon Na+ deintercalation/intercalation. The substitution of Ti for Mn enlarges interslab distance and could restrain the unfavorable and irreversible multiphase transformation in the high voltage regions that is usually observed in O3‐type NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2, resulting in improved Na cell performance.

        "abstract": "High-voltage layered oxide cathodes attract great attention for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to the potential high energy density, but high voltage usually leads to rapid capacity decay. Herein, a stable high-voltage NaLi0.1Ni0.35Mn0.3Ti0.25O2 cathode with a ribbon-ordered superlattice is reported, and the intrinsic coupling mechanism between structure evolution and the anion redox reaction (ARR) is revealed. Li introduction constructs a special Li-O-Na configuration activating reversible nonbonded O 2p (|O2p)-type ARR and regulates the structure evolution way, enabling the reversible Li ions out-of-layer migration instead of the irreversible transition metal ions out-of-layer migration. The reversible structure evolution enhances the reversibility of the bonded O 2p (O2p)-type ARR and inhibits the generation of oxygen dimers, thus suppressing the irreversible molecular oxygen (O2)-type ARR. After the structure regulation, the structure evolution becomes reversible, |O2p-type ARR is activated, O2p-type ARR becomes stable, and O2-type ARR is inhibited, which largely suppresses the capacity degradation and voltage decay. The discharge capacity is increased from 154 to 168 mA h g-1, the capacity retention after 200 cycles significantly increases from 35 to 84%, and the voltage retention increases from 78 to 93%. This study presents some guidance for the design of high-voltage, O3-type oxide cathodes for high-performance SIBs.",

        "title": "Understanding the effects of 3D porous architectures on promoting lithium or sodium intercalation in iodine/C cathodes synthesized via a biochemistry-enabled strategy.",
        "abstract": "Rechargeable sodium-iodine and lithium-iodine batteries have been demonstrated to be promising and scalable energy-storage devices, but their development has been seriously limited by challenges such as their inferior stability and the poor kinetics of iodine. Anchoring iodine to 3D porous carbon is an effective strategy to overcome these defects; however, both the external architecture and internal microstructure of the 3D porous carbon host can greatly affect the ion intercalation of iodine/C electrodes. To realize the full potential of iodine electrodes, a biochemistry-enabled route was developed to enable the controllable design of different 3D porous architectures, from hollow microspheres to 3D foam, for use in iodine/C cathodes. Two types of spores with spherical cells, i.e. Cibotium Barometz (C. Barometz) and Oetes Sinesis (O. Sinesis), are employed as bio-precursors. By carefully controlling the degree of damage on the bio-precursors, different targeted carbon hosts were fabricated. Systematic studies were carried out to clarify the structural effects on modifying the ion-intercalation capabilities of the iodine/C cathodes in lithium-iodine and sodium-iodine batteries. Our results demonstrate the profound performance improvements of both 3D bio-foam and hollow sphere because their hierarchically porous structures can strongly immobilize iodine. Notably, the 3D bio-foam based iodine composites achieve faster ion kinetics and enhanced rate capability than their hollow sphere based counterparts. This was attributed to their higher micro/mesopore volume, larger surface area and improved packing density, which result in the highly efficient adsorption of iodine species. By virtue of the thinnest slices, the iodine/bio-foam derived from C. Barometz spores achieves the best high-rate long-term cycling capability, which retains 94% and 91% of their capacities in lithium-iodine and sodium-iodine batteries after 500 cycles, respectively. With the help of the biochemistry-assisted technique, our study provides a much-needed fundamental insight for the rational design of 3D porous iodine/C composites, which will promote a significant research direction for the practical application of lithium/sodium-iodine batteries.",

        "title": "One–Step Synthesis of Three–Dimensional Na3V2(PO4)3/Carbon Frameworks as Promising Sodium–Ion Battery Cathode",
        "abstract": "Sodium–ion batteries (SIBs) are essential for large–scale energy storage attributed to the high abundance of sodium. Polyanion Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is a dominant cathode candidate for SIBs because of its high-voltage and sodium superionic conductor (NASICON) framework. However, the electrochemical performance of NVP is hindered by the inherently poor electronic conductivity, especially for extreme fast charging and long-duration cycling. Herein, we develop a facile one-step in-situ polycondensation method to synthesize the three-dimensional (3D) Na3V2(PO4)3/holey-carbon frameworks (NVP@C) by using melamine as carbon source. In this architecture, NVP crystals intergrown with the 3D holey-carbon frameworks provide rapid transport pathways for ion/electron transmission to increase the ultrahigh rate ability and cycle capability. Consequently, the NVP@C cathode possesses a high reversible capacity of 113.9 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and delivers an outstanding high–rate capability of 75.3 mAh g−1 at 6000 mA g−1. Moreover, it shows that the NVP@C cathode is able to display a volumetric energy density of 54 Wh L−1 at 6000 mA g−1 (31 Wh L−1 for NVP bulk), as well as excellent cycling performance of 65.4 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 2000 mA g−1. Furthermore, the NVP@C exhibits remarkable reversible capabilities of 81.9 mAh g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 and 60.2 mAh g−1 at 1000 mA g−1 even at a low temperature of −15 °C. The structure of porous carbon frameworks combined with single crystal materials by in-situ polycondensation offers general guidelines for the design of sodium, lithium and potassium energy storage materials.",

        "abstract": "Recently, nonmetal NH4 + ions have attracted extensive attention for use as charge carries in the field of energy storage due to their abundant resources, environmental friendliness, and low cost. However, the development of aqueous ammonium-ion batteries (AAIBs) is constrained by the absence of high-voltage and long-life materials. Herein, different tunnel-structure MnO2 materials (α-, β-, and γ-MnO2 ) are utilized as cathodes for AAIBs and hybrid-ion batteries and compared, and α-MnO2 is demonstrated to exhibit the most remarkable electrochemical performance. The α-MnO2 cathode material delivers the highest discharge capacity of 219 mAh g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1 and the best cyclability with a capacity retention of 95.4% after 10 000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1 . Moreover, aqueous ammonium-ion and hybrid-ion (ammonium/sodium ions) full batteries are successfully constructed using α-MnO2 cathodes.

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is regarded as a promising cathode material for sodium ion batteries (NIBs) because of its 3D open structure suitable for Na insertion/extraction and high energy density. However, the NVP suffers from poor electrical conductivity, which restricts the rate performance and the long cycle performance of the NVP for NIBs. Here, the NVP particles embedded in the N,S co-doped 3D porous carbon matrix (denoted as NVP@3D-NSC) were prepared by a facile process. The NVP@3D-NSC can deliver high specific discharge capacities at high rates (54 mA h g-1 at 80 C). It exhibits a super long cycle life exceeding 6000 cycles (75 mA h g-1 at 20 C after 6000 cycles) and a low capacity-decay rate of 0.36% per cycle. The excellent electrochemical performance of the NVP@3D-NSC is attributed to the specific architecture of the material that combines a variety of advantages: a very short diffusion length of Na+/e- in small NVP particles, a high contact area between the electrolyte and electrode, and a 3D porous structure buffering the volume change during cycling. In addition, the N,S co-doped porous carbon matrix can not only improve the electrical conductivity, but also create some extrinsic defects and active sites, which can enhance the diffusion rate of sodium ions.",

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as a potential candidate to succeed lithium ion batteries (LIBs), because of the abundant sodium resources on earth. Layered vanadium oxides are regarded as the promising candidates for SIBs because of their large interlayer spacing, high theoretical specific capacity, abundant sources and low cost. In this paper, a vanadium oxide hydrate (H2V3O8) nanowire membrane is presented as a flexible cathode for SIBs without addition of any other additives (binders or conductive compounds). Such a freestanding flexible membrane exhibits a high specific capacity of 168 mA h g(-1) at 10 mA g(-1), and its high capacity is maintained well after 100 cycles. It is found that the capacitive charge storage accounts for a relatively large proportion of the total capacity, whereas the crystal structure of H2V3O8 is highly reversible during the sodiation/desodiation processes. This research demonstrates that the H2V3O8 nanowire is an exceptional candidate for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "High voltage P2-Na2/3[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2 is regarded as a promising cathode for high-energy sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the undesired P2-O2 phase transition at high voltages above 4.0 V leads to a large volume change and further causes the rapid decay of capacity. Herein, an electrochemical-active Co3+ substitution is introduced to suppress the P2-O2 phase transformation but not at the cost of capacity. The spherical, Co3+ substituted P2-Na2/3[Ni0.3Co0.1Mn0.6]O2 with a high tap-density of 1.86 g cm-3 is successfully synthesized by co-precipitation and solid-state reactions. As anticipated, it delivers a large specific capacity of 161.6 mA h g-1 with a high median-voltage of 3.64 V (vs. Na/Na+), translated into a high energy-density of ∼590 W h kg-1, which is comparable to that of the commercialized LiCoO2 cathode in lithium-ion batteries. Apart from improved cycling stability ascribed to the mitigated P2-O2 transition, this cathode also shows a better rate property compared with those modified by Li+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, and Ti4+ doping and Al2O3 coating. Besides, the P2-Na2/3[Ni0.3Co0.1Mn0.6]O2|hard carbon full-cells deliver a reversible capacity of 150.6 mA h g-1 and have enhanced cycle-life and high-rate capability. These gratifying achievements indicate that this P2-Na2/3[Ni0.3Co0.1Mn0.6]O2 is a very promising candidate as a high energy-density cathode for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "A series of alluaudite Na2 Fe3-x Mnx (PO4 )3 microcompounds, which self-assembled from primary nanorods, were prepared successfully through a solvothermal method. As a promising candidate cathode for sodium-ion batteries, it is necessary to obtain a deeper understanding of the relationship between the structure and physicochemical properties of these materials. The local electronic and geometric environments were systematically investigated, for the first time, by using a combination of soft/hard X-ray absorption, IR, and Mössbauer spectroscopy. The results show that the electrochemical performance is not only associated with morphology, but also with the electronic and crystalline structure. With the introduction of manganese into the lattice, the long-range order maintains the isostructural framework and the lattice parameters expand as expected. However, for short-range order, PO4 tetrahedra and MO6 octahedra (M=Fe and Mn) become more severely distorted as a function of Mn concentration. Meanwhile, larger MnO6 octahedra will compress the space of FeO6 octahedra, which will result in stronger core/electron-electron interactions for Fe, as characterized by hard/soft X-ray absorption spectra. These slight changes in the electronic and local structures lead to different electrochemical performances with changes to the manganese content. Moreover, other physicochemical properties, such as magnetic behavior, are also confirmed to be correlated with these different electron interactions and local geometric environments.",

        "abstract": "Layered Na-based oxides with the general composition of NaxTMO2 (TM: transition metal) have attracted significant attention for their high compositional diversity that provides tunable electrochemical performance for electrodes in sodium-ion batteries. The various compositions bring forward complex structural chemistry that is decisive for the layered stacking structure, Na-ion conductivity, and the redox activity, potentially promising new avenues in functional material properties. In this work, we have explored the maximum Na content in P2-type layered oxides and discovered that the high-content Na in the host enhances the structural stability; moreover, it promotes the oxidation of low-valent cations to their high oxidation states (in this case Ni2+). This can be rationalized by the increased hybridization of the O(2p)-TM(3d-eg*) states, affecting both the local TM environment as well as the interactions between the NaO2 and TMO2 layers. These properties are highly beneficial for the Na storage capabilities as required for cathode materials in sodium-ion batteries. It leads to excellent Na-ion mobility, a large storage capacity (>100 mAh g–1 between 2.0-4.0 V), yet preventing the detrimental sliding of the TMO2 layers (P2–O2 structural transition), as reflected by the ultralong cycle life (3000 (dis)charge cycles demonstrated). These findings expand the horizons of high Na-content P2-type materials, providing new insights of the electronic and structural chemistry for advanced cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the development of cathode materials for Na-ion batteries has gained much attention due to the abundance, low cost, and easy availability of resources. Apart from the usual metal oxides, multi-electron redox materials grabbed attention due to their high energy density and practical capacity with long cycle life. Polyoxometalates (POMs) are inorganic clusters of higher valent metals, and act as electron sponges with multi-electron redox properties. Herein we report a Keggin-type polyoxometalate [PMo10V2O40]5− with Na+ and H+ counter cations as a cathode material for Na-ion batteries. Further the formation of POM is evidenced by PXRD, FT-IR, flame photometry and XPS studies. In Na-POM, Na+ ions in the intercluster cavities provide a better pathway and easy diffusion during the charge/discharge process, and contribute to better electrochemical properties than H-POM. The DFT studies further explore the detailed mechanistic pathway of Na+ ions around the clusters in the normal and super-reduced states. Na-POM enables better cycling stability and capacity retention with a specific discharge capacity of 123 mA h g−1 at 0.1C rate at room temperature.",

        "abstract": "Undesired reactions between layered sodium transition-metal oxide cathodes and air impede their utilization in practical sodium-ion batteries. Consequently, a fundamental understanding of how layered oxide cathodes degrade in air is of paramount importance, but it has not been fully understood yet. Here a comprehensive study on a model material NaNi0.7Mn0.15Co0.15O2 reveals its reaction chemistry with air and the dynamic evolution of the degradation species upon air exposure. We find that besides the extraction of Na+ ions from the crystal lattice to form NaOH, Na2CO3, and Na2CO3·H2O in contact with air, nickel ions gradually dissolve from the bulk to form NiO and accumulate on the particle surface as revealed by subnanometer surface-sensitive time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy. The degradation species on the surface are insulating, leading to an increase in interfacial resistance and declined electrochemical performance. We also demonstrate a feasible surface coating strategy for suppressing the unfavorable degradation process. Understanding the degradation mechanism at a nanoscale can facilitate the future development of high-energy cathodes for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Substituting electrochemically active elements such as Li and Mg in P2-type layered sodium oxide is an effective strategy for developing competitive cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. However, the lack of atomic-level understanding regarding the distribution of substitution positions complicates the comprehension of the roles of substituting atoms and the mechanism of sodium-ion intercalation. In this study, we identified the stable configurations of Na in Na0.75Ni0.3Mn0.7O2 and Na0.75Li0.15Mg0.05Ni0.1Mn0.7O2 materials using the site exclusion method. Through simulating the complete charging process for both materials, the structure evolution of the cathodes during the cycling and the impact of the partial substitution of Ni elements by Li and Mg atoms were comprehensively elucidated. Our findings revealed that Mg atoms effectively regulate the distribution of forces within the materials, essentially serving as supportive pillars within the cathode. Meanwhile, Li atoms efficiently mitigated electron localization, consequently diminishing volume fluctuations during the charging process. More importantly, the substitution with Li and Mg atoms could synergistically reduce the interaction between transition metals and sodium ions, thereby reducing the diffusion energy barrier of Na ions. This study not only enhances the comprehension of substituted metal atoms in P2 layered oxides but also offers new insights for the development of sodium-ion cathode materials.",

The rational design, synthesis, and characterization of a complex heterotrimetallic single-source molecular precursor for the next generation sodium-ion battery cathode material, Na2Mn2FeO6, is described. A unique pentametallic platform [MnII(ptac)3-Na-MnIII(acac)3-Na-MnII(ptac)3] (1) was derived from the known polymeric structure of [NaMnII(acac)3]∞, through a series of elaborate design procedures, such as mixed-ligand, unsymmetric ligand, and mixed-valent approaches. Importantly, the application of those techniques results in a molecule with distinctively different transition metal positions in terms of ligand environment and oxidation states. An isovalent substitution of FeIII for the central MnIII ion forms the target heterotrimetallic precursor [MnII(ptac)3-Na-FeIII(acac)3-Na-MnII(ptac)3] (3) with an appropriate metal ratio of Na:Mn:Fe = 2:2:1. The arrangement of metal ions and ligands in this pentametallic assembly was confirmed by single crystal X-ray investigation. The unambiguous assignment of the positions and oxidation states of the Periodic Table neighbors Fe and Mn in 3 has been achieved by a combination of investigative techniques that include synchrotron resonant diffraction, X-ray multiwavelength anomalous diffraction, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, Mössbauer spectroscopy, and gas-phase DART mass spectrometry.

Herein, we report that the water-soluble SA can be utilized as a binder in aqueous Zn batteries because SA could cross-link with the Zn2+ ion to form a water-insoluble and mechanically super strong binder for electrodes. Aqueous Zn||LiFePO4 cells are assembled to demonstrate the performance of the SA binder for LiFePO4 cathodes. Due to the high adhesion strength of cross-linked Zn-SA, LiFePO4 with the SA binder displays a high capacity retention of 93.7% with a high Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% after 100 cycles at a 0.2 C rate, while the capacity of LiFePO4 with the PVDF binder quickly decays to 84.7% after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. In addition, the LiFePO4 cathode with the SA binder also has smaller redox polarization, faster ion diffusion rate, and more favorable electrochemical kinetics than that with the PVDF binder.",

With respect to PB cathodes, however, their intrinsic crystal regularity, vacancies, and coordinated water will lead to low specific capacity and poor rate performance, impeding their application. Herein, nanocubic porous Nax FeFe(CN)6 coated with polydopamine (PDA) as a coupling layer to improve its electrochemical performance is reported, inspired by the excellent adhesive property of PDA. As a cathode for sodium-ion batteries, the Nax FeFe(CN)6 electrode coupled with PDA delivers a reversible capacity of 93.8 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 0.2 A g-1 , and a discharge capacity of 72.6 mA h g-1 at 5.0 A g-1 . The sodium storage mechanism of this Nax FeFe(CN)6 coupled with PDA is revealed via in situ Raman spectroscopy. The first-principles computational results indicate that FeII sites in PB prefer to couple with the robust PDA layer to stabilize the PB structure. Moreover, the sodium-ion migration in the PB structure is enhanced after coating with PDA, thus improving the sodium storage properties. Both experiments and computational simulations present guidelines for the rational design of nanomaterials as electrodes for energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "The cycle stability and voltage retention of a Na2Mn[Fe(CN)6] (NMF) cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) has been impeded by the huge distortion from NaMnII[FeIII(CN)6] to MnIII[FeIII(CN)6] caused by the Jahn-Teller (JT) effect of Mn3+. Herein, we propose a topotactic epitaxy process to generate K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] (KMF) submicron octahedra and assemble them into octahedral superstructures (OSs) by tuning the kinetics of topotactic transformation. As the SIB cathode, the self-assembly behavior of KMF improves the structural stability and decreases the contact area with the electrolyte, thereby inhibiting the transition metal in the KMF cathode from dissolving in the electrolyte. More importantly, the KMF partly transforms into NMF with Na+ de/intercalation, and the existing KMF acts as a stabilizer to disrupt the long-range JT order of NMF, thereby suppressing the overall JT distortion. As a result, the electrochemical performances of KMF cathodes outperform NMF with a highly reversible phase transition and outstanding cycling performance, and 80% capacity retention after 1500/1300 cycles at 0.1/0.5 A g-1.

        "abstract": "P2-phase layered cathodes play a pivotal role in sodium-ion batteries due to their efficient Na+ intercalation chemistry. However, limited by crystal disintegration and interfacial instability, bulk and interfacial failure plague their electrochemical performance. To address these challenges, a structural enhancement combined with surface modification is achieved through trace Y doping. Based on a synergistic combination of experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the introduction of partial Y ions at the Na site (2d) acts as a stabilizing pillar, mitigating the electrostatic repulsions between adjacent TMO2 slabs and thereby relieving internal structural stress. Furthermore, the presence of Y effectively optimizes the Ni 3d-O 2p hybridization, resulting in enhanced electronic conductivity and a notable rapid charging ability, with a capacity of 77.3 mA h g-1 at 40 C. Concurrently, the introduction of Y also induces the formation of perovskite nano-islands, which serve to minimize side reactions and modulate interfacial diffusion. As a result, the refined P2-Na0.65 Y0.025 [Ni0.33 Mn0.67 ]O2 cathode material exhibits an exceptionally low volume variation (≈1.99%), an impressive capacity retention of 83.3% even at -40 °C after1500 cycles at 1 C.",

Here, an ultra-stable and ultra-thin perylene-dicyandiamide-based hydrogen organic framework (HOF) nanosheet (P-DCD) of ≈3.5 nm in thickness is developed. When applied in the cathode, the P-DCD exhibits exceptional long-term capacity retention for alkali-ion batteries (AIBs).

For sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), the related capacity retains 91.7% within 10 000 cycles compared to the initial state, significantly much more stable than conventional organic materials reported previously. Mechanism studies through ex situ and in situ experiments and theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the impressive long-term performance retention originates from the large electron delocalization, fast ion diffusion, and physicochemical stability within the ultra-thin 2D P-DCD, featuring π-π and hydrogen bonding stacking, nitrogen-rich units, and low impedance.

Herein, the composite materials of manganese-iron based Prussian white and reduced graphene oxide (PW/rGO) were synthesized via a one-step in situ synthesis method with sodium citrate, which was employed both as a chelating agent to control the reaction rate during the coprecipitation process of PW synthesis and as a reducing agent for GO. The low precipitation speed helps minimize lattice defects, while rGO enhances electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the one-step in situ synthesis method is simpler and more efficient than the traditional synthesis method. Compared with pure PW, the PW/rGO composites exhibit significantly improved electrochemical properties. Cycling performance tests indicated that the PW/rGO-10 sample exhibited the highest initial discharge capacity and the best cyclic stability. The PW/rGO-10 has an initial discharge capacity of 128 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C (1 C = 170 mA g-1), and retains 49.53% capacity retention after 100 cycles, while the PW only delivers 112 mAh g-1 with a capacity retention of 17.79% after 100 cycles. Moreover, PW/rGO-10 also shows better rate performance and higher sodium ion diffusion coefficient (DNa+) than the PW sample.

Such measurements on NaxV2(PO4)3 identified vanadium to be the only ion undergoing oxidation/reduction processes upon battery operation.

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) based on IL electrolytes have attracted great attention, particularly in large-scale energy storage systems for renewable energy due to the abundance of sodium and the excellent safety resulting from the use of non-flammable ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes. In this article, a series of 15 functionalized room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) suitable as electrolytes is presented. Special emphasis was laid on the purity of the synthesized RTILs and a consistent and uniform characterization of their physicochemical properties. Evaluation of the viscosity, conductivity, and thermal and electrochemical stabilities resulted in clear structure-property relationships, rendering the ether functionalized RTILs most promising for application in SIBs. Electrochemical investigations of the ether functionalized IL electrolytes in SIB half cells (Na0.6Mn0.9Co0.1O2 as cathode material) proved their compatibility with a SIB system. Stable cycling performance was achieved with the piperidinium based RTIL IL 6 outperforming the organic electrolyte by far with a retention of 81% after 350 cycles. These results show the suitability of RTILs to enhance the performance of SIB systems and serve as a basis for the design of high performance IL electrolytes.",

Here we propose a cyanoperovskite KxMnFe(CN)6 (0 ≤ x ≤ 2) as a potassium cathode: high-spin MnIII/MnII and low-spin FeIII/FeII couples have similar energies and exhibit two close plateaus centered at 3.6 V; two active K+ per formula unit enable a theoretical specific capacity of 156 mAh g-1; Mn and Fe are the two most-desired transition metals for electrodes because they are cheap and environmental friendly.

Herein, K-doped Na5V12O32 (KNVO) was developed to promote its ionic/electronic migration, and thus enhance the Zn2+ storage capability.

However, neither theoretical energy/power density nor the practical values reach the values of Li cathodes. Poorer performance is expected owing to larger size, larger mass, and lower cell voltage. Nonetheless, sodium ion batteries are considered to be practically relevant in view of the abundance of the element Na. The arguments in favor of Li and to the disadvantage of Na would be completely obsolete if the specific performance data of the latter would match the first. Here we present a cathode consisting of carbon-coated nanosized Na3V2(PO4)3 embedded in a porous carbon matrix, which not only matches but even outshines lithium cathodes under high rate conditions. It can be (dis)charged in 6 s with a current density as high as 22 A/g (200 C), still delivering a specific capacity of 44 mAh/g, while up to 20 C, the polarization is completely negligible.",

We investigated the changes in the crystal structure, surface chemistry, and particle morphology caused by Ti doping and correlated these changes to the improved performance. The enhanced rate capability and cycling stability were attributed to the enlargement of the NaO2 slab in the crystal structure because of Ti doping.

Bi5+ is doped into pure NFM in order to tune the structure, whereas, a thin layer of Bi2O3 is coated on surface of the Bi5+-coated NFM to modify the surface. The structure, morphology, and electrochemical performance of prepared samples are analyzed and compared by various characterization techniques. The pristine NFM cathode exhibits the specific discharge capacity of 170 mAh g-1, while Bi-doped cathode exhibits 181 mAh g-1, and Bi2O3 coated cathode renders 180 mAh g-1. It is observed that, pristine NFM cathode suffers rapid capacity degradation and nearly ~80% capacity loss within first 250 cycles. After 1000 cycles, BNFM shows 47% capacity retention, while, BNMF@Bi2O3 shows 73% capacity retention of initial capacity. This improvement in the rate capability is obtained due to the effect of Bi-doping and Bi2O3 coating, where, former enlarges interlayer spacing and latter provides the ionic conducting channel as well as protects the particle from the contact of the electrolyte.

        "abstract": "The conventional P2-type cathode material Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 suffers from an irreversible P2–O2 phase transition and serious capacity fading during cycling. Here, we successfully carry out magnesium and calcium ion doping into the transition-metal layers (TM layers) and the alkali-metal layers (AM layers), respectively, of Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2. Both Mg and Ca doping can reduce O-type stacking in the high-voltage region, leading to enhanced cycling endurance, however, this is associated with a decrease in capacity. The results of density functional theory (DFT) studies reveal that the introduction of Mg2+ and Ca2+ make high-voltage reactions (oxygen redox and Ni4+/Ni3+ redox reactions) less accessible. Thanks to the synergetic effect of co-doping with Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions, the adverse effects on high-voltage reactions involving Ni–O bonding are limited, and the structural stability is further enhanced. The finally obtained P2-type Na0.62Ca0.025Ni0.28Mg0.05Mn0.67O2 exhibits a satisfactory initial energy density of 468.2 W h kg−1 and good capacity retention of 83% after 100 cycles at 50 mA g−1 within the voltage range of 2.2–4.35 V.

        "abstract": "Abstract Conventional sodium‐based layered oxide cathodes are extremely air sensitive and possess poor electrochemical performance along with safety concerns when operating at high voltage. The polyanion phosphate, Na3V2(PO4)3 stands out as an excellent candidate due to its high nominal voltage, ambient air stability, and long cycle life. The caveat is that Na3V2(PO4)3 can only exhibit reversible capacities in the range of 100 mAh g−1, 20% below its theoretical capacity. Here, the synthesis and characterizations are reported for the first time of the sodium‐rich vanadium oxyfluorophosphate, Na3.2Ni0.2V1.8(PO4)2F2O, a tailored derivative compound of Na3V2(PO4)3, with extensive electrochemical and structural analyses. Na3.2Ni0.2V1.8(PO4)2F2O delivers an initial reversible capacity of 117 mAh g−1 between 2.5 and 4.5 V under the 1C rate at room temperature, with 85% capacity retention after 900 cycles. The cycling stability is further improved when the material is cycled at 50 °C within 2.8–4.3 V for 100 cycles. When paired with a presodiated hard carbon, Na3.2Ni0.2V1.8(PO4)2F2O cycled with a capacity retention of 85% after 500 cycles. Cosubstitution of the transition metal and fluorine in Na3.2Ni0.2V1.8(PO4)2F2O as well as the sodium‐rich structure are the major factors behind the improvement of specific capacity and cycling stability, which paves the way for this cathode in sodium‐ion batteries.",

However, the LLOs are faced with rapid decay of charge/discharge capacity and voltage, as well as interface side reactions, which limit its electrochemical performance. Herein, the dual strategies of sulfite/sodium ion co-doping and lithium carbonate coating were used to improve it. It founds that modified LLOs achieve 88.74% initial coulomb efficiency, 295.3 mAh g-1 first turn discharge capacity, in addition to 216.9 mAh g-1 at 1 C, and 87.23% capacity retention after 100 cycles. Mechanism research indicated that the excellent electrochemical performance benefits from the doping of both Na+ and SO32-, and it could significantly reduce the migration energy barrier of Li+ and promote Li+ migration. Meanwhile, anion and cation are co-doped greatly reduces the band gap of LLOs and increase its electrical conductivity, and no electron spin barrier leap effect at the Fermi level.

Herein, a flame‐retardant s designed, self‐purging high‐voltage electrolyte is designed to stabilize SMBs with the use of ethoxy (pentafluoro) cyclotriphosphazene (PFPN) as the electrolyte additive. PFPN can participate in the shell structure of solvation through stronger van der Waals force to form Na3N, NaF‐rich solid/cathode electrolyte interphase (SEI/CEI) with electronic insulation and fast ion transport. Moreover, harmful impurity (PF5) also can be scavenged by van der Waals force to avoid HF production, which helps to stabilize the electrode interface.

Here, the synthesis and room temperature electrochemical performance of Na2CoSiO4 have been investigated with the compound found to yield a reversible capacity greater than 100 mA h g-1 at a rate of 5 mA g-1. Insights into the crystal structures of Na2CoSiO4 were obtained through refinement of structural models for its two polymorphs, Pn and Pbca. Atomistic modelling results indicate that intrinsic defect levels are not significant and that Na+ diffusion follows 3D pathways with low activation barriers, which suggest favourable electrode kinetics.

Herein, a two‐step carbon‐coating technique has been developed to synthesize high‐performance NFP@C cathode materials by controlling the NFP particle size and the coating layer uniformity. The first step of in‐situ carbon coating greatly restrains the excessive growth of NFP crystals with a shortened Na‐ion diffusion path. Meantime, the extra secondary carbon‐coating is adopted to repair some exposed areas, guaranteeing the full coverage of NFP particles for rapid electronic transfer. As a consequence, the as‐obtained NFP@C cathode delivers a high discharge capacity of 95.2 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C (theoretical value: 97 mAh g−1) and with high‐rate capability (75.2 mAh g−1 at 5 C) within 2.0–4.0 V.

To address these issues, this work designed a novel intergrowth layered oxide cathode with P2 and O3 phases by implementing Cu and Ti into the structure with the formation of high-entropy cathode materials with superior performance for SIBs. The electrochemical test results show that the optimized high-entropy cathode with the P2/O3 intergrowth structure possesses a high initial discharge capacity of 157.85 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C, an excellent rate performance of 84.41 mAh g-1 at 10 C, and long-term stability with capacity retention of 83.25% after 500 cycles at 5C. Furthermore, the analysis results of ex situ XRD and in situ XRD indicate that the adverse phase transition of P2-O2 under high voltage is effectively suppressed. This work indicates that the integration of high-entropy strategy with the two-phase intergrowth structure can effectively stabilize the layered structure, suppress the slipping of transition metal layers, and improve electrochemical performance, which provides a new approach for designing high-performance and practical layered transition metal oxide cathode materials for advanced SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sacrificial cathode additive as a pre-metallation method could ensure adequate metal sources for advanced energy storage devices. However, this pre-metallation technique is seriously suffered from the precise regulation of decomposition potential of additive. Herein, a molecularly compensated pre-metallation (Li/Na/K) strategy has been successfully achieved through Kolbe electrolysis, in which the electrochemical oxidation potential of metal carboxylate is manipulated by the bonding energy of oxygen-metal (O-M) moiety. As theoretically predicted, the electron-donating effect of substituent and low charge density of cation can dramatically weaken the O-M bond strength, further bringing out the reduced potential. Thus, sodium acetate exhibits a superior pre-sodiation feature for sodium-ion battery accompanied with a large irreversible specific capacity of 301.8 mAh g -1 , remarkably delivering 70. 6% enhanced capacity retention after 100 cycles. Notably, this elaborate methodology has been profoundly extended to construct high-performance lithium-ion battery and lithium/sodium/potassium-ion capacitor. This breakthrough has paved an innovative pathway for pre-metallation enabled by organic electrochemistry, offering in-depth insights into directional design of sacrificial reagent for electrochemical energy storage systems.",

        "abstract": "Exploring the energy transition The first session chaired by Marcel Weil (KIT) focused on the need for energy transition towards renewable energy sources for sustainable development. Weil’s keynote explored current challenges associated with batteries as energy storage devices. It is evident that for both stationary and mobile energy storage applications batteries will play a significant role as an electrochemical energy storage technology. Particularly, lithium-ion batteries are widely used due to their technical properties, economics, and operability. However, their sustainability is being questioned due to material demand, production costs, environmental and social impacts, technical disadvantages, safety, and end-of-life treatment. Thus, there is a high necessity to develop new battery chemistries that are more environmentally friendly, techno-economically feasible, and disassociated from negative social impacts. Many new concepts such as sodium-ion, magnesium, zinc, and aluminum batteries are emerging with the promise of better sustainability. The following six presentations offered valuable perspectives on evaluating emerging battery technologies: Viera Pechancová (Tomas Bata University) delved into the social sustainability aspects of these technologies. Sebastián Pinto Bautista (KIT) presented prospective life cycle assessments (LCAs) of novel batteries, including Mg-batteries and metaland liquid-free organic batteries, whereas Manuel Baumann (KIT) discussed the toxicity screening of precursor materials for sodium-ion battery cathodes. The presentations reiterated the potential of innovation and emerging technologies, highlighting the importance of assessing their unintended risks, as emphasized in Grunwald’s plenary talk.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Manganese dioxide (MnO2) is considered as a strong candidate in the field of new‐generation electronic equipment. Herein, Co‐MnO2 has excellent electrochemical properties in tests as the cathode electrode of sodium‐ion batteries and potassium‐ion batteries. The rate performance remains at 50.2 mAh g−1 at 200 mA g−1 for sodium‐ion batteries. X‐ray diffraction (XRD) is utilized to evaluate the crystal structure transition from Co0.2‐MnO2 to NaMnO2 with discharge to 1 V, proving that Co‐doping does indeed facilitate the acceleration of ion transport and support layer spacing to stabilize the structure of MnO2. Subsequently, highly conductive (0.0848 S cm−1) gel‐type supercapacitors are prepared by combining Co0.2‐MnO2, potassium hydroxide (KOH), and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) together. Co0.2‐MnO2 provides capacitive behavior and strengthens the hydrogen bonds between molecules. KOH acts as an ion crosslinker to enhance hydrogen bond and as electrolyte to transport ions. 5 wt% Co0.2‐MnO2@KOH/PVA has superb mechanical endurance, appreciable electrical conductivity, and ideal capacitive behavior. The quasi‐solid‐state supercapacitor demonstrates stabilized longevity (86.5% at 0.2 mA cm−3 after 500 cycles), which can greatly promote the integration of flexible energy storage fabric devices.",

        "abstract": "A general polymer‐assisted spinodal decomposition strategy is used to prepare hierarchically porous sodium super ionic conductor (NASICON)‐structured polyanion‐type materials (e.g., Na3V2(PO4)3, Li3V2(PO4)3, K3V2(PO4)3, Na4MnV(PO4)3, and Na2TiV(PO4)3) in a tetrahydrofuran/ethanol/H2O synthesis system. Depending on the boiling point of solvents, the selective evaporation of the solvents induces both macrophase separation via spinodal decomposition and mesophase separation via self‐assembly of inorganic precursors and amphiphilic block copolymers, leading to the formation of hierarchically porous structures. The resulting hierarchically porous Na3V2(PO4)3 possessing large specific surface area (≈77 m2 g−1) and pore volume (≈0.272 cm3 g−1) shows a high specific capacity of 117.6 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C achieving the theoretical value and a long cycling life with 77% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 5 C.

        "abstract": "To improve the energy and power density of Na‐ion batteries, an increasing number of researchers have focused their attention on activation of the anionic redox process. Although several materials have been proposed, few studies have focused on the Na‐rich materials compared with Li‐rich materials. A key aspect is sufficient utilization of anionic species. Herein, a comprehensive study of Mn‐based Na1.2Mn0.4Ir0.4O2 (NMI) O3‐type Na‐rich materials is presented, which involves both cationic and anionic contributions during the redox process. The single‐cation redox step relies on the Mn3+/Mn4+, whereas Ir atoms build a strong covalent bond with O and effectively suppress the O2 release. In situ Raman, ex situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and soft‐X‐ray absorption spectroscopy are employed to unequivocally confirm the reversibility of O22− species formation and suggest a high degree of anionic reaction in this NMI Na‐rich material. In operando X‐ray diffraction study discloses the asymmetric structure evolution between the initial and subsequent cycles, which also explains the effect of the charge compensation mechanism on the electrochemical performance.

        "abstract": "Manganese-based NASICON-type compounds are promising as high-energy-density cathodes for sodium-ion batteries. However, the structural defects of Mn ions inside the crystal framework reduce the sodium storage capacity, voltage plateau, and cyclic stability of the cathodes. Here, a strategy to inhibit the Mn ion defects of Na4MnCr(PO4)3 has been proposed by using different phosphate sources. It is found that Na4MnCr(PO4)3 prepared with NH4H2PO4 (NMCP-N) exhibits less noticeable voltage hysteresis than that of Na4MnCr(PO4)3 prepared with H3PO4 (NMCP-H), indicating that the site occupation defects of Mn ions in the Na4MnCr(PO4)3 crystal structure are successfully suppressed, as confirmed by theoretical calculations and structural refinements. In the case of NMCP-N, a capacity of 109.7 mAh g-1 is delivered at 0.01 A g-1, and 54.2% capacity retention can be kept after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g-1, which is much better than that of the counterpart of NMCP-H (a lower capacity of 96.1 mAh g-1 and poorer cyclability of only 22.8% capacity retention after 500 cycles), showing that the structure defects strongly affect the sodium storage properties of Na4MnCr(PO4)3 cathodes.

        "abstract": "Layered cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have gained considerable attention as promising candidates owing to their high capacity and potential for industrial scalability. Nonetheless, challenges arise from stress and structural degradation resulting from the deposition of larger ion radius species, leading to diminished cyclic stability and rate performance. In this study, we present a novel and straightforward strategy that combines the synergistic effects of an amorphous aluminum oxide coating and aluminum ion doping. This approach effectively addresses the issues of grain cracking and expands the interlayer spacing of alkali metal ions in SIB materials, thereby enhancing their overall performance. Consequently, it optimizes the diffusion of charge carriers and facilitates interfacial charge transfer, leading to remarkable improvements in the performance of the NaNi0.33Mn0.33Fe0.33O2 material with 0.4 wt % amorphous aluminum oxide coating (NNMF-0.4A), which exhibits reversible capacities of 135.7, 114.3, 106.8, 99.9, 89.5, and 77.1 mAh g-1 at 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 C, respectively. Furthermore, the NNMF-0.4A material maintains a capacity of 76.7 mA g-1 after 500 cycles at a current density of 800 mA g-1 (10 C), with a capacity retention rate of 98.2%.

        "abstract": "Vanadate oxides with low price and high theoretical capacity are competitive cathodes for aqueous zinc‐ion batteries (AZIBs). However, the existing problems such as sluggish Zn2+ ion mobility, weak conductivity, and complicated flexible electrode preparation hinder the development of their practical applications in flexible AZIBs (FAZIBs). Herein, sodium‐ion and polyaniline are co‐inserted into ammonium vanadate (NaNVO‐PANI) nanoarrays, which can serve as the novel freestanding cathodes for FAZIBs. By virtue of synergistic pillar effect of sodium ions and polyaniline, the interplanar spacing of NaNVO‐PANI expands to ≈13.8 Å. Both experimental data and theoretical calculation confirm that the optimal spacing of NaNVO‐PANI can boost enhance the electronic conductivity and reduce Zn2+ diffusion barrier. As expected, the resulting coin‐type AZIBs exhibit high capacity of 610.7 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and remarkable capacity retention of 98% after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1. More encouragingly, quasi‐solid‐state FAZIBs with sandwich structure are assembled, achieving impressive energy density of 345.59 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 380.46 W kg−1.

        "abstract": "Metal vanadium phosphates (MVP), particularly Li3V2(PO4)3 (LVP) and Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP), are regarded as the next-generation cathode materials in lithium/sodium ion batteries. These materials possess desirable properties such as high stability, theoretical capacity, and operating voltages. Yet, low electrical/ionic conductivities of LVP and NVP have limited their applications in demanding devices such as electric vehicles. In this work, a novel synthesis route for the preparation of LVP/NVP micro/mesoporous 3D foams via assembly of elastin-like polypeptides is demonstrated. The as-synthesized MVP 3D foams consist of microporous networks of mesoporous nanofibers, where the surfaces of individual fibers are covered with MVP nanocrystallites. TEM images further reveal that LVP/NVP nanoparticles are about 100-200 nm in diameter, with each particle enveloped by a 5 nm thick carbon shell. The MVP 3D foams prepared in this work exhibit ultrafast rate capabilities (79 mA h g(-1) at 100C and 66 mA h g(-1) at 200C for LVP 3D foams; 73 mA h g(-1) at 100C and 51 mA h g(-1) at 200C for NVP 3D foams) and excellent cycle performance (almost 100% performance retention after 1000 cycles at 100C); their properties are far superior compared to current state-of-the-art active materials.",

Herein, a novel heterogeneous Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)/Na2VTi(PO4)3 (NFPP/NVTP) material with stable multielectron reaction is constructed by spray drying technology. The mutual promotion effect of intergrowth structures effectively improves the purity and the crystallization of NFPP/NVTP during the fabrication process, which is beneficial to the high capacity and cycling stability. As a result, the optimized NFPP/NVTP demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 155.3 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1 and outstanding cycling stability with 82.9% capacity retention over 2500 cycles at 1 A g-1, which are much superior to those of NFPP and NVTP individually. Even in full cell configuration, the energy density remains high at ≈380 Wh kg-1 based on the cathode mass. The high capacity of NFPP/NVTP is also attributed to the successive reduction/oxidation mechanism involving the introduction of Ti3+ and interfacial charge redistribution effect between the heterogeneous phases, which greatly improve the electronic and ionic conductivity.

        "abstract": "The carbon coating strategy has emerged as an indispensable approach to improve the conductivity of polyanionic cathodes. However, owing to the complex reaction process between precursors of carbon and cathode, establishing a unified screening principle for carbonaceous precursors remains a technical challenge. Herein, we reveal that carbonaceous precursor pyrolysis chemistry undeniably influences the formation process and performance of Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathodes from in situ insights. By investigating three types of carbonaceous precursors, it is found that O/H-containing functional groups can provide more bonding sites for cathode precursors and generate a reducing atmosphere by pyrolysis, which is beneficial to the formation of polyanionic materials and a uniform carbon coating layer. Conversely, excessive pyrolysis of functional groups leads to a significant amount of gas, which is detrimental to the compactness of the carbon layer. Furthermore, the substantial presence of residual heteroatoms diminishes graphitization. In this case, it is demonstrated that carbon dots (CDs) precursors with suitable functional groups can comprehensively enhance the Na+ migration rate, reversibility, and interface stability of the cathode material. As a result, the NVP/CDs cathode displays outstanding capacity retention, maintaining 92% after 10,000 cycles at a high rate of 50 C. Altogether, these findings provide a valuable benchmark for carbon source selection for polyanionic cathodes.",

Nevertheless, the influence of Li at different locations in the structure has not been investigated. Here, the crystallographic role and electrochemical impact of lithium on different sites in PNNMO is investigated in LixNa0.67–yNi0.33Mn0.67O2+δ (0.00 ≤ x ≤ 0.2, y = 0, 0.1). Lithium occupancy on prismatic Na sites is promoted in Na-deficient (Na < 0.67) PNNMO, evidenced by ex situ and operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and 7Li solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance. Partial substitution of Na with Li leads to enhanced stability and slightly increased specific capacity compared to PNNMO. In contrast, when lithium is located primarily on octahedral TM sites, capacity is increased but at the cost of stability.",

A training database was generated utilizing the previous 124 545 electrode databases, and a test set of 3126 potential NASICON structures [NaxMyM'1-y(PO4)3] with 27 dopants at the metal site and 6 dopants at the polyanion central site was constructed. The developed ML surrogate model identifies 796 materials that satisfy the following criteria: formation energy of <0.0 eV/atom, energy above hull of ≤0.025 eV/atom, volume change of ≤4%, and theoretical capacity of ≥50 mAh/g. The thermodynamically stable configurations of doped NASICON structures were then selected using machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP), enabling rapid consideration of various dopant site configurations. DFT calculations are followed on 796 screened materials to obtain energy density, average voltage, and volume change. Finally, 50 candidates with an average voltage of ≥3.5 V are identified.

        "abstract": "P2/O3 composite sodium layered oxide has emerged as a promising cathode for high-performance Na-ion batteries. However, it has been challenging to regulate accurately the phase ratio of P2/O3 composite due to their high compositional diversity, which brings about some difficulty in manipulating the electrochemical performance of P2/O3 composite. Here, we explore the effect of Ti substitution and the synthesis temperature on the crystal structure and Na storage performance of Na0.8Ni0.4Mn0.6O2. The investigation indicates Ti-substitution and altering synthesis temperature can rationally manipulate the phase ratio of P2/O3 composite, thereby purposefully regulating the cycling and rate performance of P2/O3 composite. Typically, O3-rich Na0.8Ni0.4Mn0.4Ti0.2O2-950 shows excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 84% (3C, 700 cycles). By elevating the proportion of P2 phase, Na0.8Ni0.4Mn0.4Ti0.2O2-850 displays concurrently improved rate capability (65% capacity retention at 5 C) and comparable cycling stability. These findings will help guide the rational design of high-performance P2/O3 composite cathodes for sodium-ion batteries.",

The partial substitution of Ni and Mn with Fe in the O3-phase lattice can greatly improve the electrochemical performance and the structural stability. A NaFe0.2Mn0.4Ni0.4O2 cathode with an optimized Fe content of x = 0.2 can deliver an initial reversible capacity of 131 mAh g(-1), a reversible capacity greater than 95% over 30 cycles, and a high rate capacity of 86 mAh g(-1) at 10 C in a voltage range of 2.0-4.0 V. The structural characterizations reveal that pristine NaMn0.5Ni0.5O2 and Fe-substituted NaFe0.2Mn0.4Ni0.4O2 lattices underwent different phase transformations from P3 to P3″ and from P3 to OP2 phases, respectively, at high voltage interval. The as-resulted OP2 phase by Fe substitution has smaller interslab distance (5.13 Å) than the P3″ phase (5.72 Å), which suppresses the co-insertion of the solvent molecules, the electrolyte anions, or both and therefore enhances the cycling stability in the high voltage charge.

        "abstract": "The O3-type layered oxide cathodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as one of the most promising systems to fully meet the requirement for future practical application. However, fatal issues in several respects such as poor air stability, irreversible complex multiphase evolution, inferior cycling lifespan, and poor industrial feasibility are restricting their commercialization development. Here, a stable Co-free O3-type NaNi0.4Cu0.05Mg0.05Mn0.4Ti0.1O2 cathode material with large-scale production could solve these problems for practical SIBs. Owing to the synergetic contribution of the multielement chemical substitution strategy, this novel cathode not only shows excellent air stability and thermal stability as well as a simple phase-transition process but also delivers outstanding battery performance in half-cell and full-cell systems. Meanwhile, various advanced characterization techniques are utilized to accurately decipher the crystalline formation process, atomic arrangement, structural evolution, and inherent effect mechanisms. Surprisingly, apart from restraining the unfavorable multiphase transformation and enhancing air stability, the accurate multielement chemical substitution engineering also shows a pinning effect to alleviate the lattice strains for the high structural reversibility and enlarges the interlayer spacing reasonably to enhance Na+ diffusion, resulting in excellent comprehensive performance. Overall, this study explores the fundamental scientific understandings of multielement chemical substitution strategy and opens up a new field for increasing the practicality to commercialization.",

Due to their improved safety, polyanion framework compounds have recently gained attention as potential candidates. With the earth‐abundant element Fe being the redox center, the uniform carbon‐coated Na3.32Fe2.34(P2O7)2/C composite represents a promising alternative for sodium‐ion batteries. The electrochemical results show that the as‐prepared Na3.32Fe2.34(P2O7)2/C composite can deliver capacity of ≈100 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C (1 C = 120 mA g−1), with capacity retention of 92.3% at 0.5 C after 300 cycles. After adding fluoroethylene carbonate additive to the electrolyte, 89.6% of the initial capacity is maintained, even after 1100 cycles at 5 C. The electrochemical mechanism is systematically investigated via both in situ synchrotron X‐ray diffraction and density functional theory calculations. The results show that the sodiation and desodiation are single‐phase‐transition processes with two 1D sodium paths, which facilitates fast ionic diffusion. A small volume change, nearly 100% first‐cycle Coulombic efficiency, and a pseudocapacitance contribution are also demonstrated.

        "abstract": "Red phosphorus (P) has been recognized as a promising material for lithium/sodium ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs) because of their high theoretical capacity. However, tremendous volume variation and low conductivity limit its widespread applications. Hence, we design and synthesize uniformly distributed honeycomb-like hierarchical micro-mesoporous carbon nanospheres (HHPCNSs) with ultralarge pore volume (3.258 cm3 g-1) on a large scale through a facile way. The large pore volume provides enough space for loading of P and the expansion of P, and the uniform distribution of the micro-mesopores makes the red P loaded uniformly. The resulted HHPCNSs/P composite exhibits extremely high capacity (2463.8 and 2367.6 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 for LIBs and SIBs, respectively), splendid rate performance (842.2 and 831.1 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1 for LIBs and SIBs, respectively) and superior cycling stability (1201.6 and 938.4 mA h g-1 at 2 and 5 A g-1 after 1000 cycles for LIBs, and 1269.4 and 861.8 mA h g-1 at 2 and 5 A g-1 after 1000 cycles for SIBs, respectively). More importantly, when coupled with LiFePO4 and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, lithium/sodium-ion full batteries display high capacity, superior rate and cycling performances, revealing the practicability of HHPCNSs/P composite. The exceptional electrochemical performance is caused by the honeycomb-like carbon network with ultralarge pore volume, uniformly distributed hierarchical micro-mesoporous nanostructure, outstanding electronic conductivity and excellent nanostructural stability, which is much better than currently reported P/C materials for both LIBs and SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Cu-Ni-Mn-based ternary P2-type NaxCu0.15Ni0.20Mn0.65O2 (x = 0.50, 0.67, and 0.75) cathodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are synthesized by a co-precipitation method. We find that Na content plays a key role on the structure, morphology, and the charge-discharge performances of these materials. For x = 0.67 and 0.75, superstructure from Na+-vacancy ordering is observed, while it is absent in the x = 0.50 sample. Despite the same synthesis conditions, materials with x = 0.67 and 0.75 show smaller particle sizes compared to that of the x = 0.50 sample. In addition, redox potentials of the materials differ significantly even though they have the same transition metal ratios. These differences are attributed to the changes in local structures of the as-prepared materials arising from the different amount of Na and possibly oxygen in the lattice. Materials with x = 0.67 and 0.75 show excellent rate performance and cycle stability when tested as cathode material of SIBs. Average discharge potential is as high as 3.41 V versus Na-Na+ with capacity of 87 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1. Excellent capacity and cycle stability are maintained even when they are tested with higher current rates. For instance, a capacity of 62.3 mAh g-1 is obtained from the x = 0.67 sample at 1000 mA g-1 after 1000 cycles between 3.0 and 4.2 V without any decrease in capacity.",

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)3 has shown great promise in next-generation cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries owning to its fast Na+ diffusion in the three-dimensional open NASICON framework and high theoretical energy density. However, Na3V2(PO4)3 suffers from undesirable rate performance and unstable cyclability arising from low electronic conductivity. Herein, we propose a facile approach for significantly enhancing the electrochemical properties of Na3V2(PO4)3 by Ti doping at V site and constructing nanoparticle@carbon core-shell nanostructure. This material design provides fast electron conduction network within the whole active particles because of the mixed valence Ti4+/3+ in bulk and highly conductive carbon shell on the surface. Lattice doping and carbon coating reduce the electrode polarization and facilitate the electrode reaction kinetics, while the nanostructure enhances the ionic conduction by shortening the diffusion distance and offers sufficient contact of active particles with organic electrolyte. The multiple synergetic effects enable a superior electrochemical performance. The optimized Na3V1.9Ti0.1(PO4)3@C cathode shows a high specific capacity (116.6 mAh g-1 at 1C), an unprecedented rate performance (93.4 mAh g-1 at 400C), and an exceptional long-term high-rate cycling stability (capacity retention of 69.5% after 14 000 cycles at 100C, corresponding to 0.0002% decay per cycle).",

The P2-type sodium-based layered oxide Na0.67[Mn0.67Ni0.33]O2 with high operating potential upon 4.3 V and high theoretical capacity has emerged as a most promising cathodes. However, the material suffers from severe capacity decay during the electrochemical reaction process. Herein, P2-Na0.67[Mn0.67Ni0.21Li0.06Zn0.06]O2 cathode is gained by moderately substituting lithium/zinc into the nickel sites. The inactive Li/Zn co-substitution is endowed with safeguard ability to stabilize the crystal structure, resulting in enhanced electrochemical kinetics and remarkable long cyclic performance in liquid & solid-state electrolyte. Thus the Li/Zn co-substituted cathode presents specific capacity of 154 mAh g1 at the first discharge process, excellent rate capability with 77 mAh g1 at a high current density of 5 C, and long cyclic stability in liquid-state batteries. Excitingly, it is also endowed with a high capacity retention of 85% after 500 cycles in solid-state batteries. Furthermore, a combination of ex-situ XRD, TEM and ex-situ XPS are applied to reveal the structural evolution and charge compensation mechanism of P2-Na0.67[Mn0.67Ni0.21Li0.06Zn0.06]O2, allowing a deep insight into the great significance of structural safeguard ability.",

First, we showed that the Hubbard Ucorrection within the GGA + Uapproach is necessary to correctly refer these molybdates to semiconductors. The sodium diffusion along various pathways was thoroughly examined, which allowed us to establish the most probable pathways with the lowest migration barriers. These compounds have different directions of sodium diffusion with twice different barriers that was associated to the peculiarities of their crystal structure. The high potentials and structural stability during sodium extraction, along with low‐diffusion barriers predicted for NaMFe(MoO4)3 (M = Mg, Ni) indicate that these molybdates may be promising high‐voltage cathode materials for sodium‐ion batteries.",

Nat. Commun. 2014, 5, 4358). It forms an Fe-based polyanionic compound delivering the highest Fe-redox potential along with excellent rate kinetics and reversibility. However, like all known SO4-based insertion materials, its synthesis is cumbersome that warrants careful processing avoiding any aqueous exposure. Here, an alternate low temperature ionothermal synthesis has been described to produce the alluaudite Na2+2xFe(II)2-x(SO4)3. It marks the first demonstration of solvothermal synthesis of alluaudite Na2+2xM(II)2-x(SO4)3 (M = 3d metals) family of cathodes. Unlike classical solid-state route, this solvothermal route favors sustainable synthesis of homogeneous nanostructured alluaudite products at only 300 °C, the lowest temperature value until date. The current work reports the synthetic aspects of pristine and modified ionothermal synthesis of Na2+2xFe(II)2-x(SO4)3 having tunable size (300 nm ∼5 μm) and morphology. It shows antiferromagnetic ordering below 12 K. A reversible capacity in excess of 80 mAh/g was obtained with good rate kinetics and cycling stability over 50 cycles. Using a synergistic approach combining experimental and ab initio DFT analysis, the structural, magnetic, electronic, and electrochemical properties and the structural limitation to extract full capacity have been described.",

Using periodic density functional theory calculations, we identified the critical factors that determine the sodium ion site preference and their ionic mobility. Specifically, the significant role of octahedral tilting and trigonal distortions of the structure have been highlighted. The study shows that the competition between coordination and bond length governs the Na site preference in the rhombohedral phase upon distortion. The results furthermore suggest that the redox activity is dominated by the transition metals. These findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying ionic conductivity in solid hosts and could thus help enhance ion transport in battery electrodes.",

Such a superior sodium storage performance derives from the nitrogen doping carbon coating, triggering amounts of extrinsical defects and active sites in the N-doped amorphous carbon layer, which highly accelerates Na-ion and electron transport. This approach is simple, facile and shows easy scale-up. It could be extended to other materials for energy storage.",

This work aims to provide a deeper insight into the dehydration process of PW materials and a better understanding of the impact of their fast rehydration, upon exposure to moisture, on their characterization. For this purpose, a Na1.87Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.99·1.99H2O sample was synthesized by a coprecipitation method and subsequently dehydrated to remove water. After thorough characterization, our findings show that drying parameters, such as temperature and pressure, strongly influence the post-drying result.

However, the fast capacity fade by undesirable structural degradation in liquid electrolyte during long-term cycling is a stumbling block for the commercial application of high-Ni oxides. In this work, a functional gel polymer electrolyte, grafted with sodium alginate, is introduced to increase the stability of high-Ni oxide cathodes at the levels of both the particle and electrode. An in situ generated ion-conducting layer appears on the interface through the chemical interaction between transition-metal cations of the cathode and the metalophilic reticulum group in sodium alginate. Such a tailoring layer can not only enhance the interfacial compatibility on the cathode/electrolyte interface, reducing the interfacial resistance, but also inhibit the HF corrosion, suppressing the dissolution of transition-metal cations and harmful gradient distribution of components through the oxide cathode at the electrode level. Meanwhile, detrimental microcracks in oxide microspheres and between primary crystallites are impressively inhibited at the particle level. The high-Ni oxide cathode with the metalophilic gel polymer electrolyte shows excellent cycle stability with large initial capacity of 204.9 mA h g-1 at a 1.0 C rate and high discharge capacity retention within 300 cycles at high temperature.",

NVF nanoparticles show an excellent Na+ storage capacity (∼205 mAh g-1) in a high voltage window up to 4.2 V with ultralong cycling stability. That is associated with the mixed occupancy of V and Na in NVF. The multivalent V centers serve as electron reservoirs to inhibit phase transformation, and the Na-enriched Na3VF6 with better electron conductivity acts as a Na+ reservoir for effective electron transfer.

We herein present a comprehensive study of intrinsic point defects in NMO using density functional theory (DFT) calculations in combination with thermodynamics. Using the DFT+U approach, we determine the formation energies of elementary defects and defect complexes depending on the sets of atomic chemical potentials, corresponding to a certain thermodynamic condition for the synthesis of stable NMO. Sodium interstitials are found to have the lowest formation energies in the relevant ranges of temperature and pressure. Other intrinsic point defects such as oxygen vacancies, sodium vacancies and manganese antisites can also be formed with proper formation energies and have an impact on the cathode performance. Compared to the perfect system, oxygen vacancies lower the electrode voltage, whereas manganese vacancies and antisites increase the voltage. We find that most point defects and defect complexes improve the sodium ion diffusivity, highlighting a proper control of defect formation for enhancing the performance of sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The main challenge of sodium-ion batteries is cycling stability, which is usually compromised due to strain induced by sodium insertion. Reliable high-voltage cathode materials are needed to compensate the generally lower operating voltages of Na-ion batteries compared to Li-ion ones. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) computations were used to evaluate the thermodynamic, structural, and kinetic properties of the high voltage λ-Mn2O4 and λ-Mn1.5Ni0.5O4 spinel structures as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Determination of the enthalpies of formation reveal the reaction mechanisms (phase separation vs solid solution) during sodiation, while structural analysis underlines the importance of minimizing strain to retain the metastable sodiated phases. For the λ-Mn1.5Ni0.5O4 spinel, a thorough examination of the Mn/Ni cation distribution (dis/ordered variants) was performed. The exact sodiation mechanism was found to be dependent on the transition metal ordering in a similar fashion to the insertion behavior observed in the Li-ion system. The preferred reaction mechanism for the perfectly ordered spinel is phase separation throughout the sodiation range, while in the disordered spinel, the phase separation terminates in the 0.625 < x < 0.875 concentration range and is followed by a solid solution insertion reaction. Na-ion diffusion in the spinel lattice was studied using DFT as well. Energy barriers of 0.3–0.4 eV were predicted for the pure spinel, comparing extremely well with the ones for the Li-ion and being significantly better than the barriers reported for multivalent ions. Additionally, Na-ion macroscopic diffusion through the 8a-16c-8a 3D network was demonstrated via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. For the λ-Mn1.5Ni0.5O4, MD simulations at 600 K bring forward a normal to inverse spinel half-transformation, common for spinels at high temperatures, showing the contrast in Na-ion diffusion between the normal and inverse lattice. The observed Ni migration to the tetrahedral sites at room temperature MD simulations explains the kinetic limitations experienced experimentally. Therefore, this work provides a detailed understanding of the (de)sodiation mechanisms of high voltage λ-Mn2O4 and λ-Mn1.5Ni0.5O4 spinel structures, which are of potential interest as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Gel electrolytes hold promise for stabilizing zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs), but achieving both high ionic conductivity and strong mechanical properties remains challenging. This work presents a double network gel electrolyte based on poly(N-hydroxymethyl acrylamide) (PNMA) and sodium alginate (SA), overcoming this trade-off. The PNMA network provides mechanical strength and water retention, while the SA network facilitates rapid zinc-ion (Zn2+) diffusion through tailored solvation. This double network gel exhibits a tensile strength of up to 838 kPa, significantly higher than previous reports. The SA network provides ion channels for rapid transport of hydrated Zn2+, enhancing the ionic conductivity to a ground-breaking 33.1 mS cm-1. This value is even higher than the liquid electrolytes. The growth of Zn dendrites is also suppressed due to the mechanical constraint and rapid ion conduction. In symmetrical cells, the PNMA/SA gel demonstrates exceptional cycling stability (>2000 h). Characterizations show this is because of reduced free water amount, hindering cathode material dissolution. The full cells with sodium vanadate cathode manifest a high capacity (364.8 mA h g-1 at 0.5 A g-1) and excellent capacity retention (83% after 2500 cycles at 10 A g-1). This double network design offers a way to achieve high-performance and stable ZIBs.",

        "abstract": "Fe-based mixed phosphate cathodes for Na-ion batteries usually possess weak rate capacity and cycle stability challenges resulting from sluggish diffusion kinetics and poor conductivity under the relatively low preparation temperature. Here, the excellent sodium storage capability of this system is obtained by introducing the high-entropy doping to enhance the electronic and ionic conductivity. As designed high-entropy doping Na4 Fe2.85 (Ni,Co,Mn,Cu,Mg)0.03 (PO4 )2 P2 O7 (NFPP-HE) cathode can release 122 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C, even 85 mAh g-1 at ultrahigh rate of 50 C, and keep a high retention of 82.3% after 1500 cycles at 10 C. Besides, the cathode also exhibits outstanding fast charge capacity in terms of the cyclability and capacity with 105 mAh g-1 at 5 C/1 C, corresponding 94.3% retention after 500 cycles. The combination of in situ X-ray diffraction, density functional theory, conductive-atomic force microscopy, and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique tests reveal that the reversible structure evolution with optimized Na+ migration path and energy barrier boost the Na+ kinetics and improve the interfacial electronic transfer, thus improving performance.",

        "abstract": "Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) show promise as cathodes for sodium-ion batteries due to their notable cycle stability, cost-effectiveness, and eco-friendly nature, yet the presence of interstitial water limits the specific capacity and obstructs Na+ mobility within the material. Although considerable experimental efforts are focused on dehydrating water for capacity enhancement, there is still a deficiency of a comprehensive understanding of the low capacity of low-spin Fe resulting from interstitial water, which holds significance in Na+ storage. This study introduces a novel gas-assisted heat treatment method to efficiently remove interstitial water from Fe-based PBA (NaFeHCF) electrodes and combines experiments and theoretical calculations to reveal the iron spin state regulation that is related to the capacity enhancement mechanism. This dehydration strategy significantly enhances battery capacity, especially the portion at higher voltages (3.4-4.0 V). The increase in capacity is attributed to the following factors: an enhanced proportion of Fe2+, reduced water content which facilitates faster charge transfer, and the activation of low spin Fe2+. The optimized NaFeHCF demonstrated impressive half-cell performance of retaining 87.3% capacity after 2000 cycles at a 5 C rate and achieving 100 mAh g-1 capacity over 200 cycles when being paired with hard carbon, exhibiting its practical potential.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion battery (SIB) is a candidate for the stationary energy storage systems because of the low cost and high abundance of sodium. However, the energy density and lifespan of SIBs suffer severely from the irreversible consumption of the Na-ions for the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and other side reactions on the electrodes. Here, Na3.5C6O6 is proposed as an air-stable high-efficiency sacrificial additive in the cathode to compensate for the lost sodium. It is characteristic of low desodiation (oxidation) potential (3.4-3.6 V vs. Na+/Na) and high irreversible desodiation capacity (theoretically 378 mAh g-1). The feasibility of using Na3.5C6O6 as a sodium compensation additive is verified with the improved electrochemical performances of a Na2/3Ni1/3Mn1/3Ti1/3O2ǀǀhard carbon cells and cells using other cathode materials. In addition, the structure of Na3.5C6O6 and its desodiation path are also clarified on the basis of comprehensive physical characterizations and the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This additive decomposes completely to supply abundant Na ions during the initial charge without leaving any electrochemically inert species in the cathode. Its decomposition product C6O6 enters the carbonate electrolyte without bringing any detectable negative effects. These findings open a new avenue for elevating the energy density and/or prolonging the lifetime of the high-energy-density secondary batteries.",

        "abstract": "Layered manganese-based cathode materials are of great interest due to their high specific capacities for sodium ion batteries. However, the Jahn-Teller effect and the inevitable phase transition are detrimental for achieving considerable cycling stability and rate capability. Herein, a P2-type manganese oxide nanoplate cathode material modified by Mo-substitution with oriented stacking structure and exposed {010} active facets is reported. The manganese oxide nanoplate cathode yields remarkable capacity retention of 87.8% after 1200 cycles at 10C (2000 mA g-1). The specific power density is estimated as high as 530 W Kg-1 with a specific discharge capacity 143.9 mA h g-1 at 1C and 89.6% capacity retention up to 100 cycles. The superior electrochemical performances can be attributed to the efficient chemical modification and the unique structural features of the present manganese oxide nanoplate. Mo-modification can endow manganese oxide cathode with enlarged lattice space and average oxidation state and thus favorable Na+ diffusion to inhibit the Jahn-Teller effect and improve the structure stability, thereby achieving an extremely long cycling life. Multilayer oriented stacking nanoplate structure with exposed {010} active facets is also beneficial for providing more surface active sites and shortening the Na+ diffusion path, leading to better rate capability.",

It delivers a reversible capacity of 87 mAh g-1 at 4 A g-1 (33 C), much higher than that of tunnel Na0.44 MnO2 (72 mAh g-1 ) and layered Na0.70 MnO2 (36 mAh g-1 ). It proves that the one-pot synthesized 80T/20L is able to suppress the deactivation of L-Na0.70 MnO2 under air-exposure, which improves the specific capacity and cycling stability. Based on electrochemical kinetics analysis, the electrochemical storage of 80T/20L is mainly based on pseudocapacitive surface-controlled process. The thick film of 80T/20L cathode (a single-side mass loading over 10 mg cm-2 ) also has superior properties of pseudocapacitive response (over 83.5% at a low sweep rate of 1 mV s-1 ) and excellent rate performance.

To migrate these challenges, we develop a novel high sodium-content (0.85) and plateau-free P2-type cathode-Na 0.85 Li 0.12 Ni 0.22 Mn 0.66 O 2 (P2-NLNMO). The complete solid solution reaction in wide voltage range ensures both small volume variation (1.7 %) and fast Na + kinetics (10 - 11 cm 2 s - 1 ). The high sodium-content P2-NLNMO exhibits a higher reversible capacity of 123.4 mA h g - 1 , superior rate capacity of 79.3 mA h g -1  at 20 C and 85.4% of capacity retention after 500 cycles at 5 C. The sufficient Na and complete solid-solution reaction are critical to realize high-performance P2-type cathode for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Enhancing the kinetics of lattice oxygen redox (LOR) in P2‐type layered sodium oxide cathodes is crucial for the advancement of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) with superior energy and power densities. Electronic structure regulation stands out as a highly effective approach to address the inherent limitations of P2‐type layered oxides with LOR, including sluggish kinetics, phase transitions, voltage hysteresis, and local structural distortion. Herein, a strategy involving the introduction of CoO6 octahedra with π‐interaction into Na0.6Li0.1Fe0.3−xCoxMn0.6O2 (x = 0, 0.15, 0.3) cathodes to facilitate Na‐ion transport is proposed. Furthermore, the impact of FeO6 octahedra with σ‐interaction in P2‐type cathodes on electrochemical performance is comprehensively investigated. Through multimodal in‐situ and ex‐situ characterization techniques, it is revealed that Co─O with π‐interaction effectively mitigates P2‐OP4 phase transitions by strengthening Na─O, reduces voltage hysteresis, and stabilizes the local structure. Consequently, Na0.6Li0.1Co0.3Mn0.6O2 demonstrates enhanced Na‐ion diffusion kinetics, leading to improved rate performance and a reversible capacity of 55 mAh g−1 at 10 C, significantly outperforming cathodes with Fe─O σ‐interaction. Moreover, when coupled with hard carbon, the full cell achieves a remarkable energy density of 395 Wh kg−1 (on cathode) at 0.1 C, with a capacity retention of 75% over 100 cycles at 1 C.",

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPOF) is attracting great interest due to its large capacity and high working voltage. However, the poor electronic conductivity limits the electrochemical performance of NVPOF. Herein, we fabricate N/P-dual-doped carbon coated NVPOF microspheres (labeled as NVPOF@P/N/C) via a hydrothermal process followed by heat treatment. This microsphere-structured NVPOF@P/N/C composite has a relatively high tap density of 1.22 g cm-3. TEM and XPS results reveal that the dual-doped carbon layer is tightly coated on the NVPOF surface due to the bridging effect of P and has a good protective effect on NVPOF. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that N/P-dual-doped carbon layer is advantageous to achieve higher electronic conductivity and lower migration activation energy than the undoped and single N- or P-doped carbon layer. As cathode material for sodium-ion battery (SIB), the NVPOF@P/N/C exhibits high capacity (128 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C and 122 mAh g-1 at 2 C) and ultra-long cycle performance (only 0.037% capacity fading rate per cycle in 500 cycles at 2 C).

However, originating from the rapid crystal growth, PBAs still suffer from considerable vacancy defects and interstitial water, making the preparation of long-cycle-life PBAs the greatest challenge for its practical application. Herein, a novel equilibrium chelation strategy is first proposed to synthesize a high crystallinity (94.7%) PBAs, which is realized by modulating the chelating potency of strong chelating agents via \"acid effect\" to achieve a moderate chelating effect, forcefully breaking through the bottleneck of poor cyclic stability for PBAs cathodes. Impressively, the as-prepared highly crystalline PBAs represent an unprecedented level of electrochemical performance including ultra-long lifespan (10000 cycles with 86.32% capacity maintenance at 6 A g-1), excellent rate capability (82.0 mAh g-1 at 6 A g-1).

        "abstract": "Polyanionic Na2FePO4F is one of the most important cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. The orthorhombic β-Na2FePO4F material has been studied extensively and intensively since it was proposed. In this article, a novel monoclinic sodium phosphate fluoride α-Na2FePO4F is concerned. Kirsanova's experiment showed that Na and Fe ions in α-Na2FePO4F are prone to antisite, leading to strong antisite disorder. Through first-principle calculations, we show that the steric effect, the magnetic exchange and superexchange interactions between transition-metal cations are shown to be the main driving forces for Na+/Fe2+ antisite disorder. We first calculated the crystal structures, electronic properties, and cohesive energies of all the 10 antisite phases of α-Na2FePO4F and β-Na2FePO4F. Then, we compared the difference charge densities, magnetism, binding energies, and electrostatic potentials of α-Na2FePO4F and β-Na2FePO4F materials in the antisite and pristine phases. In α-Na2FePO4F, the binding energy of the antisite phase with the lowest binding energy is almost degenerate with that of the pristine phase. Moreover, only small differences of the electrostatic potential and the charge density distribution are found between the antisite (with lowest energy) and the pristine phases of α-Na2FePO4F, which also helped elaborate the facile formation of Na+/Fe2+ antisite in the α-Na2FePO4F material.

        "abstract": "To mitigate the environmental impact of the improper disposal of spent LiFePO4 batteries and reduce resource waste, the development of LiFePO4 recycling technologies is of paramount importance. Meanwhile, olivine-structured NaFePO4 in sodium-ion batteries has received great attention, due to its high theoretical specific capacity of 154 mAh g-1 and excellent stability. However, olivine NaFePO4 only can be synthesized from olivine LiFePO4. Accordingly, in this proposal, developing the continuous flow electrochemical solid-liquid reactor-based metal ion insertion technology is to utilize the olivine FePO4, recycled from LiFePO4, and to synthesize NaFePO4. Additionally, by employing I- as the reducing agent, NaFePO4 is successfully synthesized with a discharge-specific capacity of 134 mAh g-1 at 0.1C and a remarkable capacity retention rate of 86.5% after 100 cycles at 0.2C. And the reasons for sodium deficiency in the synthesized NFP are elucidated through first-principles calculations. Furthermore, the kinetics of the solid-solution reaction 2 (Na2/3+βPO4→ Na1-αFePO4) mechanism improve with cycling and are sensitive to temperature. Utilizing a minimal amount of reducing agent in the electrochemical reactor, NaFePO4 synthesis is successfully achieved. This innovative approach offers a new, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly strategy for preparing NaFePO4 from recycling LiFePO4.",

        "abstract": "The P2-layered metal oxide cathode materials are crucial for constructing high-rate sodium-ion batteries (SIBs); however, its practical application is hindered by the high Na+ diffusion barrier resulting from Na+/vacancy ordering. Herein, a Li/Zn cosubstitution P2-Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 (NLNZM) cathode was synthesized via a sol-gel method assisted with citric acid, which can induce the rearrangement of Na+ sites to disrupt ordered structures. The XRD Rietveld refinement confirms a higher occupancy of Na+ at Nae sites with low diffusion barriers through the Li/Zn cosubstitution. In addition, the highly reversible phase evolution of the NLNZM is confirmed through in situ XRD results, thereby ensuring the stability of the structure with low volume change rate (0.78%). Furthermore, Li and Zn can reduce the surface energy and increase the interlayered distance to achieve rapid interfacial kinetics. As a result, the NLNZM has exhibited a high reversible capacity of 152.8 mAh g-1 and an outstanding rate performance of 103.4 mAh g-1 at 5C. After 200 cycles at 5C, the capacity retention rate is 81.1%.

Nevertheless, the intricate phase transitions during the charging-discharging significantly impede its practical application. This paper proposes a strategy for successfully synthesizing NaNi0.5Mn0.3Ti0.2O2 (NNMT) by combining coprecipitation and a high-temperature solid-state method. This method introduces Ti elements while retaining the electrochemically active Ni2+ content, thus, the NNMT has a high initial specific capacity of 151.4 mAh g-1 at 1 C. It is demonstrated that introducing Ti4+ leads to the transition metal layers becoming disordered by ex situ XRD, thus mitigating the irreversible phase transition of the material. In addition, Ti4+ does not have an outer electron, which can reduce electron delocalization in the transition metal layer and improve the material's cyclic stability. The NNMT possesses a capacity retention rate of 60.66% after 150 cycles, much higher than the initial NNM's 18.96%. It also exhibits an excellent discharge capacity of 86.8 mAh g-1 at 5 C. In conclusion, the cycling and rate performance of the Ti-substituted NNMT are greatly improved without capacity loss, which offers innovative concepts for the modification means of the SIBs layered oxide cathode materials.",

Herein, nano P2-Na2/3(Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13)O2 (NCM) materials are synthesized using a modified Pechini method as a prospective high-voltage sodium storage component without any modification. The changes in the local ionic state around Ni, Mn, and Co ions with respect to the calcination temperature are recorded using X-ray absorption fine structure analysis. Among the electrodes, NCM fired at 850 °C (NCM-850) exhibits excellent electrochemical properties with an initial capacity and energy density of 148 mAh g–1 and 555 Wh kg–1, respectively, when cycled between 2 and 4.5 V at 160 mA g–1 along with improved cyclic stability after 100 charge/discharge cycles. In addition, the NCM-850 electrode is capable of maintaining a 75 mAh g–1 capacity even at a current density of 3200 mA g–1. In contrast, the cell fabricated with NCM obtained at 800 °C shows continuous capacity fading because of the formation of an impurity phase during the synthesis process. The obtained capacity, rate performance, and energy density along with prolonged cyclic life for the cell fabricated with the NCM-850 electrodes are some of the best reported values for sodium-ion batteries as compared to those of other p2-type sodium intercalating materials.",

        "abstract": "Manganese-based layered oxides are prospective cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their low cost and high theoretical capacities. The biphasic intergrowth structure of layered cathode materials is essential for improving the sodium storage performance, which is attributed to the synergistic effect between the two phases. However, the in-depth formation mechanism of biphasic intergrowth materials remains unclear. Herein, the layered/tunnel intergrowth Na0.6MnO2 (LT-NaMO) as a model material was successfully prepared, and their formation processes and electrochemical performance were systematically investigated. In situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction displays the detailed evolution process and excellent thermal stability of the layered/tunnel intergrowth structure. Furthermore, severe structural strain and large lattice volume changes are significantly mitigated by the interlocking effect between the phase interfaces, which further enhances the structural stability of the cathode materials during the charging/discharging process. Consequently, the LT-NaMO cathode displays fast Na+ transport kinetics with a remarkable capacity retention of ∼70.5% over 300 cycles at 5C, and its assembled full cell with hard carbon also exhibits high energy density. These findings highlight the superior electrochemical performance of intergrowth materials due to interlocking effects between layered and tunnel structures and also provide unique insights into the construction of intergrowth cathode materials for SIBs.",

        "title": "Structural and Electrochemical Investigation of 3D Tunnel Type Li0.44MnO2 Cathode Material for Secondary Li-Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "The design of new cathode materials remains a key goal in the development of (post) Li-ion batteries. In that regard, densely packed structures like Li0.44MnO2 are judicious for study. The presence of Mn as a transition metal makes it more attractive due to its sustainable nature, low cost, elemental abundance, structural diversity/polymorphism, and rich oxidation states (2+ to 7+) offering tunable redox potential [1]. Here, we have investigated Mn-based tunnel-type Li0.44MnO2 oxide for secondary LIBs.\n i) Li44MnO2 (LMO) was prepared by a soft chemical method using the corresponding sodium manganese oxide (Na0.44MnO2) as a parent compound [2]. The crystal structure of Li0.44MnO2 maintains the parent Na0.44MnO2-type tunnel structure which is analogous to Na4Mn4Ti5O18 having an orthorhombic (s.g. Pbam) crystal system [3]. To understand redox chemistry, this material was studied for both cationic (Mn) and anionic (O) redox reactions using ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The lithium (de)insertion mechanism of Li0.44MnO2 was explored involving ab initio calculations and in-situ X-ray diffraction experiments. Combined with electrochemical measurements, structural characterizations, and first principles DFT calculations revealed the capacity correlated strongly with both cationic and anionic redox reactions.\n ii) We have studied the phase transition of Li44MnO2 from a 3D tunnel-type structure to a cubic spinel structure by in-situ X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The mechanism of transformation was elucidated by employing transmission electron microscopy. In this case, diffusion-less transformation occurs involving the rearrangement of atoms during heating [4]. An increase in the average redox potential from the pristine orthorhombic phase to the final spinel phase was observed by electrochemical studies.\n iii) Further to improve the electrochemical performance of Li0.44MnO2, Ti was used as a dopant. The Li0.44[Mn1-xTix]O2 (x=0, 0.11, 0.22, 0.33, 0.44, 0.56) series were obtained with chemical ion exchange from Na precursors. The Na precursors (Na0.44[Mn1-xTix]O2) were prepared via a simple solid-state route. Ti-substituted compositions exhibited similar crystal structures to their parent LMO i.e. orthorhombic framework with Pbam symmetry. A tunnel-type morphology was observed in all cases. The electrochemical performance of Ti-substituted LMO as cathode material for LIBs was studied in a half-cell configuration. The structure and electrochemical properties of Ti-doped LMO, reaching the highest capacity of 128 mAh/g, will be described.\n \n Keywords: batteries; cathode; tunnel type manganese oxides; phase transformation; doping\n \n References:\n \n [1] N.

The low practical capacity and poor cycling stability of PBAs, however, limit their wide practical deployment. To address these issues, a new strategy is deployed through introducing Fe vacancies and Cu‐dopant into the PBAs frame structure, boosting the specific capacity and improving the cycling stability. On the one hand, the introduction of Fe vacancies in PBA (PBA□Fe) can provide additional storage sites and facilitate Na+ diffusion kinetics, yielding a high capacity of ≈164 mAh g−1 at a low current density which approaches the theoretical capacity. On the other hand, the Cu‐dopant is further helpful in stabilizing the structure of PBA□Fe, thus improving the cycling stability. This work paves a new strategy that enables unlocking the capacity and improving the cycling stability of PBA materials toward high‐performance SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The development of advanced cathode materials is still a great interest for sodium-ion batteries. The feasible commercialization of sodium-ion batteries relies on the design and exploitation of suitable electrode materials. This study offers a new insight into material design to exploit high-performance P2-type cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. The incorporation of Mg2+ into intrinsic Na+ vacancies in Na-ion layers can lead to a high-performance P2-type cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. The materials prepared by the coprecipitation approach show a well-defined morphology of secondary football-like hierarchical structures. Neutron power diffraction and refinement results demonstrate that the incorporation of Mg2+ into intrinsic vacancies can enlarge the space for Na-ion diffusion, which can increase the d-spacing of the (0 0 2) peak and the size of slabs but reduce the chemical bond length to result in an enhanced rate capability and cycling stability. The incorporation of Mg2+ into available vacancies and a unique morphology make Na0.7 Mg0.05 Mn0.8 Ni0.1 Co0.1 O2 a promising cathode, which can be charged and discharged at an ultra-high current density of 2000 mA g-1 with an excellent specific capacity of 60 mAh g-1 .

        "abstract": "O3-type layered oxide cathodes are promising for practical sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high theoretical capacity, facile synthesis, and sufficient Na+ storage. However, they face challenges such as rapid capacity loss and poor cycling stability, mainly attributed to irreversible phase transitions. To address these challenges, a novel cathode material, Li/Sn co-substituted O3-Na0.95Li0.07Sn0.01Ni0.22Fe0.2Mn0.5O2 (LSNFM), has been designed by regulating the electronic structure, in which Li+ activates more redox reactions of Ni2+/3+ and Fe3+/4+ above 2.5 V and suppresses the redox reactivity of Mn3+/4+ below 2.5 V, while Sn4+ can prevent the charge delocalization in the transition metal layer, contributing to structural stability. Due to this synergistic effect, the as-prepared LSNFM electrode with high structural reversibility displays a 27.2% capacity increase contributed by the high-voltage transition metal ion redox activity and exhibits excellent long-term cycling stability, an 84.0% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 1 C and an 84.7% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 5 C. The fundamental mechanism is fully investigated using systematic in situ/ex situ characterization techniques and density functional theory computations.

In this work, a comparative study on the electronic structures and redox reactions in oxides (LiCrO2, NaCrO2) and sulfides (LiCrS2, NaCrS2) is performed. A first-principles method has been used to calculate the Bader charge transfer, the electronic structures and the magnetic moments during the entire delithiation or desodiation process. The Bader charge analysis suggests that all the S, O and Cr ions in LiCrX2 and NaCrX2 participate in the redox reactions, where the loss of electrons of S ions is clearly larger than that of O ions. Besides, the redox processes of Cr ions are of much less significance. It is noted that, in the sulfides, Cr ions even gain a small portion of electrons rather than losing electrons during the extraction of Li/Na ions. All the charge transfer happens between the S-3p/O-2p and the Cr-3d bands. The redox reactions of O or S ions originate from the energy levels of O/S being pushed towards/across the Fermi surface due to the strong p–d hybridization.",

The potential of Na‐ASSBs based on sodium superionic conductor (NASICON)‐structured Na3V2(PO4)3(Na3VP) cathodes have been proven by their high capacity and a long cycling stability closely related to the microstructural evolution. However, the detailed kinetics of the electrochemical processes in the cathodes is still unclear. In this work, the sodiation/desodiation process of Na3VP is first investigated using in situ high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The intermediate Na2V2(PO4)3 (Na2VP) phase with the P21/c space group, which would be inhibited by constant electron beam irradiation, is observed at the atomic scale. With the calculated volume change and the electrode–electrolyte interface after cycling, it can be concluded that the Na2VP phase reduces the lattice mismatch between Na3VP and NaV2(PO4)3 (NaVP), preventing structural collapse. Based on the density functional theory calculation (DFT), the Na+ ion migrates more rapidly in the Na2VP structure, which facilitates the desodiation and sodiation processes. The formation of Na2VP phase lowers the formation energy of NaVP.

        "abstract": "Electrodes for solid-state batteries require the conduction of both ions and electrons for extraction of the energy from the active material. In this study, we apply cold sintering to a model composite cathode system to study how low-temperature densification enables a degree of control over the mixed conducting properties of such systems. The model system contains the NASICON-structured Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) active material, NASICON-structured solid electrolyte (Na3Zr2Si2PO12, NZSP), and electron-conducting carbon nanofiber (CNF). Pellets of varying weight fractions of components were cold-sintered to greater than 90% of the theoretical density at 350-375 °C, a 360 MPa uniaxial pressure, and with a 3 h dwell time using sodium hydroxide as the transient sintering aid. The bulk conductivity of the diphasic composites was measured with impedance spectroscopy; the total conductivities of the composites are increased from 3.8 × 10-8 S·cm-1 (pure NVP) to 5.81 × 10-6 S·cm-1 (60 wt % NZSP) and 1.31 × 10-5 S·cm-1 (5 wt % CNF). Complimentary direct current polarization experiments demonstrate a rational modulation in transference number (τ) of the composites; τ of pure NVP = 0.966, 60 wt % NZSP = 0.995, and 5 wt % CNF = 0.116. Finally, all three materials are combined into triphasic composites to serve as solid-state cathodes in a half-cell configuration with a liquid electrolyte. Electrochemical activity of the active material is maintained, and the capacity/energy density is comparable to prior work.",

However, to compete with mature energy storage technologies such as lithium ion batteries, further progress is needed, particularly regarding the energy density and operational lifetime. Considering these aspects as well as a circular economy perspective, the authors use biodegradable cellulose nanoparticles for the preparation of a gel polymer electrolyte that offers a high liquid electrolyte uptake of 2985%, an ionic conductivity of 2.32 mS cm-1 , and a Na+ transference number of 0.637. A balanced ratio of mechanically rigid cellulose nanocrystals and flexible cellulose nanofibers results in a mesoporous hierarchical structure that ensures close contact with metallic Na. This architecture offers stable Na plating/stripping at current densities up to ±500 µA cm-2 , outperforming conventional fossil-based NIBs containing separator-liquid electrolytes. Paired with an environmentally sustainable and economically attractive Na2 Fe2 (SO4 )3 cathode, the battery reaches an energy density of 240 Wh kg-1 , delivering 69.7 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles at a rate of 1C. In comparison, Celgard in liquid electrolyte delivers only 0.6 mAh g-1 at C/4.

        "abstract": "The abundance of raw materials is a significant advantage that positions sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) as a promising energy storage solution for the future. However, the low cycle efficiency and poor rate capacity of cathode materials have hindered the commercialization of SIBs, prompting extensive research efforts to address these challenges. Ion doping into the material structure is considered to be an effective, simple, and scalable approach to enhancing the electrical performance of cathode materials. In this work, B and F elemental ions were selectively doped into the structure of sodium-lithium-manganese-cobalt oxide material via the sol–gel method combined with calcination. The effects of B and F ion doping on the properties of the obtained materials exhibited distinct variations, particularly in the electrochemical performance. While the B-doped material (B-NLMC) exhibited a specific capacity of up to 166.5 mAh g–1 at a current density of 10 mA g–1 and maintained 72.1% capacity after 100 cycles, the material simultaneously doped with B and F ions (BF-NLMC) demonstrated lower specific capacity and cycling efficiency compared to B-NLMC. However, the BF-NLMC material exhibited significantly improved rate capability, delivering a specific capacity of up to approximately 80 mAh g–1 at a high current density of 200 mA g–1. Obviously, this research offers valuable insights into diversifying doping strategies to enhance the electrochemical performance of cathode materials, contributing to the advancement of SIB technology.",

Our results confirm that the performances of P2-NaxMO2 are associated with the chemical properties of the transition metals. In addition to this, we disclose that the involved orbitals of the 3d transition metal also greatly impact the electrochemical performance of the P2-NaxMO2 material during discharge according to the analysis of electronic structures. The jumps in the working voltage and volume during discharge are closely related to the occupation of the eg and t2g orbitals.

        "abstract": "Anionic redox in layered transition metal oxides (TMOs) cathodes presents significant opportunities for achieving high energy density batteries. However, the O 2p non‐bonding state can only undergo redox at high voltages and is often accompanied by severe structural distortion. In this study, the whole‐voltage‐range anionic redox has successfully been achieved in Metal‐organic frameworks (MOF) derived chemically homogeneous P2‐Na0.67Ni0.2Mg0.2Mn0.6O2 (NNMMO). Through a systematic analysis of the orbital combinations of TMs and O, it is found that the Mg‐induced O 2p non‐bonding state as an electron donor, forming strong π‐type interactions between Ni 3d spin‐down t2g orbitals. The resulting π‐configurational oxygen occupies an anti‐bonding state just below the Fermi level, exhibiting high oxidation activity and stability. Additionally, the high covalency between Mn and O increases the strength of the Mn–O bond, mitigating the structural aberration of NNMMO. As a result, NNMMO demonstrates a high capacity of 216 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and stable battery performance, with a capacity retention of ≈90% after 500 cycles at 2 C. This π‐type anionic redox and intrinsic competition mechanism present an alternative strategy for achieving advanced cathode materials for sodium‐ion batteries.",

Excellent capacity and cyclability were achieved at 55 °C due to its hierarchical morphology with a robust crystal structure, low charge-transfer resistance, and improved ionic diffusivity.

        "abstract": "The peak-loading shift function of sodium-ion batteries in large-grid energy store station poses a giant challenge on the account of poor rate performance of cathodes. NASICON type Na3V2(PO4)3 with a stable three-dimensional framework and fast ion diffusion channels has been regarded as one of the potential candidates and extensively studied. Nevertheless, a multilevel integrated tactic to boost the performance of Na3V2(PO4)3 in terms of crystal structure modulation, coated carbon graphitization regulation, and particle morphology design is rarely reported and deserves much attention. In this study, organic ferric was used to prepare Fe-doped Na3V2(PO4)3@C cathode on the account of low cost, environmental friendliness, and catalytic function of Fe on carbon graphitization. The density functional theory calculation depicts that the most stable site for Fe atom is the V site and moderate replacement of Fe at V position would reduce the band gap energy from 2.19 by 0.43 eV and improve the electron transfer, which is crucial for the intrinsic poor conductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3. The experimental results show that Fe element can be introduced into the bulk structure successfully, modulating relevant structural parameters. In addition, the coated carbon layer graphitization degree is also regulated due to the catalysis function of Fe. And, the decomposition of organic ferric would infuse the formation of porous structure, which can promote electrolyte permeation and shorten the electron/ion diffusion. Finally, the optimized Na3V1.85Fe0.15(PO4)3@C could possess a high capacity of 103.69 mA h g-1 and retain 91.45% after 1200 cycles at 1.0C as well as 94.45 mA h g-1 at 20C. In addition, the excellent performance is comprehensively elucidated via ex situ X-ray diffraction and pseudocapacitance characterization. The multifunction contribution of Fe-doping may provide new clue for designing porous electrode materials and a new sight into Fe-doped carbon-coated material.",

        "abstract": "Large-scale electric energy storage is fundamental to the use of renewable energy. Recently, research and development efforts on room-temperature sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) have been revitalized, as NIBs are considered promising, low-cost alternatives to the current Li-ion battery technology for large-scale applications. Herein, we introduce a novel layered oxide cathode material, Na0.78Ni0.23Mn0.69O2. This new compound provides a high reversible capacity of 138 mAh g-1 and an average potential of 3.25 V vs Na+/Na with a single smooth voltage profile. Its remarkable rate and cycling performances are attributed to the elimination of the P2-O2 phase transition upon cycling to 4.5 V. The first charge process yields an abnormally excess capacity, which has yet to be observed in other P2 layered oxides. Metal K-edge XANES results show that the major charge compensation at the metal site during Na-ion deintercalation is achieved via the oxidation of nickel (Ni2+) ions, whereas, to a large extent, manganese (Mn) ions remain in their Mn4+ state. Interestingly, electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS) results reveal differences in electronic structures in the bulk and at the surface of electrochemically cycled particles. At the surface, transition metal ions (TM ions) are in a lower valence state than in the bulk, and the O K-edge prepeak disappears. On the basis of previous reports on related Li-excess LIB cathodes, it is proposed that part of the charge compensation mechanism during the first cycle takes place at the lattice oxygen site, resulting in a surface to bulk transition metal gradient. We believe that by optimizing and controlling oxygen activity, Na layered oxide materials with higher capacities can be designed.",

        "abstract": "An intriguing mechanism for enabling fast Na kinetics during oxygen redox (OR) is proposed to produce high‐power‐density cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) based on the P2‐type oxide models, Na2/3[Mn6/9Ni3/9]O2 (NMNO) and Na2/3[Ti1/9Mn5/9Ni3/9]O2 (NTMNO) using the “potential pillar” effect. The critical structural parameter of NTMNO lowers the Na migration barrier in the desodiated state because the electrostatic repulsion of O(2p)O(2p) that occurs between transition metal layers is combined with the chemically stiff Ti4+(3d)O(2p) bond to locally retain the strong repulsion effect. The NTMNO interlayer distance moderately decreases upon charging with oxygen oxidation, whereas that of NMNO decreases at a much faster rate, which can be explained by the dependence of OR activity on the coordination environment. Fundamental electrochemical experiments clearly indicate that the Ti doping of the bare material significantly improves its rate capability during OR, and detailed electrochemical and structural analyses show much faster Na kinetics for NTMNO than for NMNO. A systematic comparison of the two cathode oxides based on experiments and first‐principles calculations establishes the “potential pillar” concept of not only improving the sluggish Na kinetics upon OR reaction but also harnessing the full potential of the anionic redox for high‐power‐density SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate (NaMnHCF) has emerged as a research hotspot among Prussian blue analogs for sodium-ion battery cathode materials due to its advantages of high voltage, high specific capacity, and abundant raw materials. However, its practical application is limited by its poor electronic conductivity. In this study, we aim to solve this problem through the in situ growth of NaMnHCF on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using a simple coprecipitation method. The results show that the overall electronic conductivity of NaMnHCF is significantly improved after the introduction of CNTs. The NaMnHCF@10%CNT sample presents a specific capacity of 90 mA h g−1, even at a current density of 20 C (2400 mA g−1). The study shows that the optimized composite exhibits a superior electrochemical performance at different mass loadings (from low to high), which is attributed to the enhanced electron transport and shortened electron pathway. Surprisingly, the cycling performance of the composites was also improved, resulting from decreased polarization and the subsequent reduction in the side reactions at the cathode/electrolyte interface. Furthermore, we revealed the evolution of potential plateau roots from the extraction of crystal water during the charge–discharge process of NaMnHCF based on the experimental results. This study is instructive not only for the practical application of NaMnHCF materials but also for advancing our scientific understanding of the behavior of crystal water during the charge–discharge process.",

        "abstract": "Layered transition‐metal (TM) oxides are ideal hosts for Li+ charge carriers largely due to the occurrence of oxygen charge compensation that stabilizes the layered structure at high voltage. Hence, enabling charge compensation in sodium layered oxides is a fascinating task for extending the cycle life of sodium‐ion batteries. Herein a Ti/Mg co‐doping strategy for a model P2‐Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 cathode material is put forward to activate charge compensation through highly hybridized O2pTM3d covalent bonds. In this way, the interlayer OO electrostatic repulsion is weakened upon deeply charging, which strongly affects the systematic total energy that transforms the striking P2–O2 interlayer contraction into a moderate solid‐solution‐type evolution. Accordingly, the cycling stability of the codoped cathode material is improved superiorly over the pristine sample. This study starts a perspective way of optimizing the sodium layered cathodes by rational structural design coupling electrochemical reactions, which can be extended to widespread battery researches.",

Further, it improves the energy density correlated with the well utilization of all Na in the compound. For Na3V2(PO4)2F3(NVPF), the extraction of the third Na, reported as the electrochemical inactivated, can be realized at a high voltage region while forming an irreversible tetragonal phase. In this study, we introduce Ti doping to the Na2VTi(PO4)2F3(NVTPF) material; we reveal that the Ti-doped NVTPF could effectively suppress the irreversible phase transformation, thus successfully harnessing Na in a wide voltage range. Experimental study discloses that the Ti-substituted Na2VTi(PO4)2F3 could take up the Na+ from Amam phase to Cmc21 phase between 1.0 V and 4.8 V reversibly accounting for the 2 Na+ transportation that shows favorable Na+ kinetics and structural stability.

Combining molten salts with solid electrolytes has led to novel processes for the preparation of sodium, magnesium and other metals. It is known that the alkaline earth chlorides dissolve substantial quantities of their own oxides, leading to electrolytes that are oxygen ion conductors, under certain conditions, and these electrolytes have been used to remove oxygen from oxide cathodes to give pure metals. Surprisingly, it has been found that when the cathodes consist of mixtures of alloys, the product is an alloy or intermetallic compound. This approach may offer a more cost effective way of preparing high value added materials. Intercalation of alkali and alkaline earth elements into oxides and graphite is discussed. The former could be used for the refining of metals and the latter for the preparation of carbon nanotubes.",

However, issues such as easy electrolyte solubility and low intrinsic conductivity contribute to high polarization and rapid capacity decay. Herein, we have designed a flexible self‐supporting cathode based on perylene‐3,4,9,10‐tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), interfacial engineering enhanced by polypyrrole (PPy), and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), forming the interconnected and flexible PTCDA/PPy/CNTs using polymerization reaction and vacuum filtration methods, effectively curbing those challenges. When used as the cathode of sodium‐ion batteries, PTCDA/PPy/CNTs exhibit excellent rate capability (105.7 mAh g−1 at 20 C), outstanding cycling stability (79.4% capacity retention at 5 C after 500 cycles), and remarkable wide temperature application capability (86.5 mAh g−1 at −30°C and 115.4 mAh g−1 at 60°C). The sodium storage mechanism was verified to be a reversible oxidation reaction between two Na+ ions and carbonyl groups by density functional theory calculations, in situ infrared Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and in situ Raman spectroscopy. Surprisingly, the pouch cells based on PTCDA/PPy/CNTs exhibit good mechanical flexibility in various mechanical states.

        "abstract": "This study evaluates the effect of equimolar substitution of manganese by cobalt or nickel in hexacyanoferrate (HCF) open frameworks as electrode materials for Na-ion batteries. As the stability of Mn-N bonds is crucial to obtain long term stability and cyclability of manganese (Mn-HCF), the samples were analyzed thoroughly using several spectroscopic and structural methods. The XPS and infrared experiments reveal that the charge density around Fe is modulated by the presence of Co or Ni, which is associated with their high polarizing power, leading to decreased cell distortion as revealed by XRD. The Rietveld refinement demonstrated that the octahedra built by 3d metals and the cyanide nitrogen were distorted with the axial bond distances being larger than the equatorial distances. This octahedral distortion promotes the spin behavior of 3/2 for Mn2+ confirmed by magnetic experiments; the arising of this spin state is attributed to d orbital splitting determined by UV-Vis experiments. Therefore, the changes upon Mn substitution are related to the modification of the covalent character of Mn-N bonds, modulated by the effect of the Ni and Co polarizing power. All these properties improve the electrochemical stability of the Ni or Co substituted materials as Na-ion batteries, leading to higher capacity retention even at higher C-rates (5C) and good capacity recovery, in comparison with those obtained for Mn-HCF.",

Herein, we introduce P2-Na0.75[Li0.15Ni0.15Mn0.7]O2, an oxygen-redox-based layered oxide cathode material for SIBs. The effect of Ni doping on the electrochemical performance was investigated by comparison with Ni-free P2-Na0.67[Li0.22Mn0.78]O2. The Na0.75[Li0.15Ni0.15Mn0.7]O2 delivered a specific capacity of ~160 mAh g-1 in the voltage region of 1.5–4.6 V at 0.1C in Na cells. Combined experiments (galvanostatic cycling, neutron powder diffraction (NPD), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (7Li NMR)) and theoretical studies (density functional theory, DFT calculations) confirmed that Ni substitution not only increases the operating voltage and decreases voltage hysteresis but also improves the cycling stability by reducing Li migration from transition metal (TM) to Na layers. This research demonstrates the effect of Li and Ni co-doping in P2-type layered materials and suggests a new strategy of using Mn-rich cathode materials via oxygen redox with optimization of doping elements for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Technical bottlenecks of polyselenide shuttling and material volume variation significantly hamper the development of emerging sodium–selenium (Na–Se) batteries. The nanopore structure of substrate materials is demonstrated to play a vital role in stabilizing Se cathodes and approaching superior Na-ion storage properties. Herein, an ideal nanorod-like trimodal hierarchical porous carbon (THPC) host is fabricated through a facile one-step carbonization method for advanced Na–Se batteries. The THPC possesses a trimodal nanopore structure encompassing micropores, mesopores, and macropores, and functions as a good accommodator of Se molecules, a reservoir of polyselenide intermediates, a buffer for volume expansion of Se species during sodiation, and a promoter for electron/ion transfer in the electrochemical process. As a result, Na–Se batteries assembled with the Se–THPC composite cathode realize high utilization of Se, fast redox kinetics, and excellent cyclability. Furthermore, the Na-ion storage mechanism of the well-designed Se–THPC composite is profoundly revealed by in situ visual characterization techniques.",

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) based on the multielectron reactions between V2+ and V5+ has been considered a promising cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, it still suffers from unsatisfactory stability, caused by the poor reversibility of the V5+/V4+ redox couple and structure evolution. Herein, we propos a strategy that combines high-entropy substitution and electrolyte optimization to boost the reversible multielectron reactions of NVP. The high reversibility of the V5+/V4+ redox couple and crystalline structure evolution are disclosed by in situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectra and in situ X-ray diffraction. Meanwhile, the electrochemical reaction kinetics of high-entropy substitution NVP (HE-NVP) can be further improved in the diglyme-based electrolyte. These enable HE-NVP to deliver a superior electrochemical performance (capacity retention of 93.1% after 2000 cycles; a large reversible capacity of 120 mAh g-1 even at 5.0 A g-1). Besides, the long cycle life and high power density of the HE-NVP∥natural graphite full-cell configuration demonstrated the superiority of HE-NVP cathode in SIBs. This work highlights that the synergism of high-entropy substitution and electrolyte optimization is a powerful strategy to enhance the sodium-storage performance of polyanionic cathodes for SIBs.",

Combining a series of advanced characterization techniques such as ex situ 51V solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray absorption near-edge structure, and in situ X-ray diffraction, we reveal that V3+/V4+ and V4+/V5+ redox couples in the materials can be accessed, leading to a 1.5-electron reaction. It is also found that a light change on the local electronic and structural states or phase change could be observed after the first cycle, resulting in the fast capacity fade at room temperature. We also showed that the irreversibility of the phase changes could be largely suppressed at low temperature, thus leading to a much improved electrochemical performance.",

        "abstract": "An environmentally benign, highly conductive, and mechanically strong binder system can overcome the dilemma of low conductivity and insufficient mechanical stability of the electrodes to achieve high performance lithium ion batteries (LIBs) at a low cost and in a sustainable way. In this work, the naturally occurring binder sodium alginate (SA) is functionalized with 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (ProDOT) via a one-step esterification reaction in a cyclohexane/dodecyl benzenesulfonic acid (DBSA)/water microemulsion system, resulting in a multifunctional polymer binder, that is, SA-PProDOT. With the synergetic effects of the functional groups (e.g., carboxyl, hydroxyl, and ester groups), the resultant SA-PProDOT polymer not only maintains the outstanding binding capabilities of sodium alginate but also enhances the mechanical integrity and lithium ion diffusion coefficient in the LiFePO4 (LFP) electrode during the operation of the batteries. Because of the conjugated network of the PProDOT and the lithium doping under the battery environment, the SA-PProDOT becomes conductive and matches the conductivity needed for LiFePO4 LIBs. Without the need of conductive additives such as carbon black, the resultant batteries have achieved the theoretical specific capacity of LiFePO4 cathode (ca. 170 mAh/g) at C/10 and ca. 120 mAh/g at 1C for more than 400 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Li‐ion batteries (LIBs) that can operate under low temperature (LT) conditions are essential for applications in orbital missions, subsea areas, and electric vehicles. Unfortunately, severe capacity loss is witnessed due to tremendous kinetic barriers that emerge at LT. Herein, to surmount such kinetic limitations, a low dielectric environment is tamed throughout the bulk electrolyte, which efficaciously brought the Li+ desolvation energy down to 30.76 kJ mol−1. At the meantime, the adoption of sodium cations (Na+) is proposed as a hetero‐cation additive, and a Li‐Na hybrid and fluoride‐rich interphase is further identified via preferential reduction of Na+‐(solvent/anion) clusters, which is found to efficiently facilitate Li+ migration through the LiF/NaF grain boundaries. Based on a N/P ratio of 1.1, the graphite/LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM) full cell (cathode loading of ≈18.5 mg cm−2) delivers a capacity as high as 125.1 mAh g−1 under −20 °C with prolonged cycling to 100 cycles. Finally, a 270 Wh kg−1 graphite/NCM pouch cell is assembled, which affords a discharge capacity of 108.7 mAh g−1 under −40 °C during the initial cycles. With an eye to both fundamental and practical aspects, this work will propel additional advancements and allow LIBs to fill more roles under extreme operation temperatures than ever before.",

        "title": "Insights into P-Type Iron- and Manganese-Based Layered Sodium Cathodes",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries are a low-cost alternative to lithium-ion batteries in large-scale electric energy storage applications due to the natural-abundant sodium resources and similar working principle to LIBs during cycling [1]. Until now, many different cathodes for SIBs have been studied, including layered transition metal oxides (NaxTMO2, x<1), Prussian blue-type compounds, polyanionic and organic compounds [2]. Among them, NaxTMO2 has been extensively reported, due to its layered structure, easy synthesis, promising electrochemical properties, and feasibility for commercial production [3]. According to the occupation of Na ions and oxygen stacking, NaxTMO2 can be classified into P2 and O3 types, where P2 structure contasins trigonal prismatic sites of sodium ions and ABBA oxygen stacking sequence and O3 structure represents octahedral sites of sodium ions and ABCABC oxygen stacking sequence [4]. At low potentials (<2.0V), there is a phase transition P2-P2’ connected with the manganese redox activity and the Jahn-Teller distortion [5]. Compared with O3-type structure, P2-type NaxTMO2 provides higher specific capacity and better structural stability due to the lower diffusion barriers through Na-ion prismatic sites [6].\n Iron- and manganese-based layered oxides for sodium-ion batteries have attracted renewed interest due to their low cost and environmental friendliness. However, the phase change at high voltage and the Jahn-Teller effect lead to shortening cycle life and poor rate capability. We design a structure optimization of the Na2/3Mn1/2Fe1/2O2 cathode through a partial substitution of Fe3+ to explore the mechanism of redox activity of P2-type Mn/Fe-based layered cathodes. We present the investigation of the effect of simultaneous cationic substitution on the electrochemical performance and structural stability of P2-Na2/3Mn1/2Fe1/2O2. The obtained material exhibits a solid solution mechanism during desodiation/resodiation process and delivers an initial discharge capacity of 168 mA h g-1 at 0.1C and a capacity retention of 80% after 50 cycles. The modified P2 composition has stable cycle performance in the potential window from 1.5V to 4.5V. The main focus here is to understand the fundamental electrochemical mechanism of this layered cathode material by exploring the redox processes of transition metal cations and oxygen anions upon cycling. In situ X-ray synchrotron radiation diffraction is used to explore the structural changes during cycling. In situ X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy is used to elucidate the local electronic structure of Fe and Mn atoms as it evolves throughout this electrochemical process. 23Na solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is used to investigate Na coordination environments during desodiation/resodiation. Ex situ soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy results reveal the participation of oxygen anions in the electrochemical reactions. Thus, we explore the redox reactions of transition metals and oxygen to explain the mechanism and the electrochemical performance for the P2-type Mn/Fe-based layered cathodes.\n \n References\n \n [1] J.-M.

Under the effect of the electrostatic interaction, organic cathode material, 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), is tightly attached to MXene nanosheets. Owing to the high electronic conductivity and special two-dimensional (2D) structure of MXene nanosheets, the issues of PTCDA cathode are effectively relieved. When applied in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), the MXene@PTCDA heterostructure exhibits significantly enhanced rate capability and cycling performance than bare PTCDA. The heterostructures proposed here can be applied to other (K, Zn, Al, Mg, Ca, etc.) battery systems.

However, their drawbacks of low Se loading, dissolution of intermediate sodium polyselenides in the electrolyte and volumetric expansion of Se impede their real applications. To address these issues, herein, we report a multifunctional Se host with MoSe2 nanosheets coupled with nitrogen-doped porous carbon hollow spheres for the first time. The N-doped hollow carbon sphere structure could provide a large space for Se loading (Se content up to 72 wt%) and accommodate the volume expansion of Se species upon cycling. MoSe2 was chosen as a polar coupling component for the carbon matrix, owing to its low conversion reaction voltage. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the MoSe2 nanosheets coupled with hollow spheres could enhance the adsorption energy of the host to polyselenides chemically, which benefits the immobilization of polyselenides. Therefore, as a cathode for Na-Se batteries, the as-prepared composite exhibits excellent energy storage performance with long cycling life and superior rate performance. Our study of introducing transition metal selenides into Na-Se batteries may stimulate the designing of diverse Se-based cathodes.",

        "abstract": "Sodium (Na) super-ionic conductor structured Na3MnTi(PO4)3 (NMTP) cathodes have garnered interest owing to their cost-effectiveness and high operating voltages. However, the voltage hysteresis phenomenon triggered by Mn Na · ${\\mathrm{Mn}}_{{\\mathrm{Na}}}^{\\mathrm{\\cdot}}$ anti-site defects ( Mn Na · ${\\mathrm{Mn}}_{{\\mathrm{Na}}}^{\\mathrm{\\cdot}}$ -ASD), namely, the occupation of Mn2+ in the Na2 vacancies in NMTP, leads to sluggish diffusion kinetics and low energy efficiency. This study employs an innovative electronic confinement-restrained strategy to achieve the regulation of Mn Na · ${\\mathrm{Mn}}_{{\\mathrm{Na}}}^{\\mathrm{\\cdot}}$ -ASD. Partial replacement of titanium (Ti) with electron-rich vanadium (V) favors strong electronic interactions with Mn2+, restraining Mn2+ migration.

        "title": "Activation of Sodium Storage Sites in Prussian Blue Analogues via Surface Etching.",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion battery technologies are known to suffer from kinetic problems associated with the solid-state diffusion of Na+ in intercalation electrodes, which results in suppressed specific capacity and degraded rate performance. Here, a controllable selective etching approach is developed for the synthesis of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) with enhanced sodium storage activity. On the basis of time-dependent experiments, a defect-induced morphological evolution mechanism from nanocube to nanoflower structure is proposed. Through in situ X-ray diffraction measurement and computational analysis, this unique structure is revealed to provide higher Na+ diffusion dynamics and negligible volume change during the sodiation/desodiation processes. As a sodium ion battery cathode, the PBA exhibits a discharge capacity of 90 mA h g-1, which is in good agreement with the complete low spin FeLS(C) redox reaction. It also demonstrates an outstanding rate capability of 71.0 mA h g-1 at 44.4 C, as well as an unprecedented cycling reversibility over 5000 times.",

        "title": "Regulating Phase Transition and Oxygen Redox to Achieve Stable High‐Voltage O3‐Type Cathode Materials for Sodium‐Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "O3‐type layered oxides are promising cathode materials for sodium‐ion batteries. However, unsatisfying cyclic stability hinders its practical application, mainly resulting from harmful phase transition and irreversible oxygen redox, especially in high‐voltage regions. Herein, a co‐doped strategy by incorporating Li+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Sb5+ into the O3‐Na0.8Ni0.4Fe0.2Mn0.4O2 cathode materials is proposed. Both suppressing the undesired phase transition over 4.1 V (vs Na/Na+) and reducing the anisotropic strain are achieved with the novel Na0.8Ni0.3Fe0.2Mn0.3Li0.1Mg0.02Ca0.05Sb0.03O2 (LMCS NFM). Moreover, restricted but highly reversible oxygen redox is observed due to strong attraction from Sb5+ and special “Li–O‐vacancy” and “Mg–O‐vacancy” configurations. The strategy brings about excellent high‐voltage cyclic stability with a reversible capacity of 130 mAh g−1 and a capacity retention of 85% after 250 cycles at 4.2 V, and less thermal runaway risk and moisture sensitivity, increasing the probability of O3‐type oxide cathode practical applications.",

        "abstract": "High-voltage cathodes with high power and stable cyclability are needed for high-performance sodium-ion batteries. However, the low kinetics and inferior capacity retention from structural instability impede the development of Mn-rich phosphate cathodes. Here, we propose light-weight fluorine (F) doping strategy to decrease the energy gap to 0.22 eV from 1.52 eV and trigger a “Mn-locking” effect—to strengthen the adjacent chemical bonding around Mn as confirmed by density functional theory calculations, which ensure the optimized Mn ligand framework, suppressed Mn dissolution, improved structural stability and enhanced electronic conductivity. The combination of in situ and ex situ techniques determine that the F dopant has no influence on the Na+ storage mechanisms. As a result, an outstanding rate performance up to 40C and an improved cycling stability (1000 cycles at 20C) are achieved. This work presents an effective and widely available light-weight anion doping strategy for high-performance polyanionic cathodes.",

        "abstract": "The NaxNi0.25Mn0.75O2 cathode material draws ongoing interest owing to its considerable specific capacity along with its elevated average operating voltage. However, its application is limited by weak rate performance and quick capacity fading. In this study, a series of NaxNi0.25Mn0.75O2 (x = 0.65, 0.70, 0.75, 0.80) cathode materials are prepared by the solid-phase method based on an orthogonal experiment. The optimum preparation process is investigated by optimizing factors such as Na content, calcination temperature, calcination time, and heating rate. The Nae/Naf ratio is adjusted, and the Na+ at different sites are rearranged to reduce the Na+/vacancy ordering by changing the Na content on the basis of process optimization. Owing to the fast migration kinetics of Nae sites, experimental results indicate that the P2-Na0.75Ni0.25Mn0.75O2 cathode material, which has Na+ occupying more thermodynamically stable Nae sites, demonstrates superior battery performance. High initial discharge specific capacity (157.2 mAh g-1) along with favorable cycle performance of the Na0.75Ni0.25Mn0.75O2 cathode material can be achieved by modifying the Nae site occupancy and optimizing the experimental conditions. Together with the microscopic control of Na+ occupancy, this novel orthogonal experiment design offers a fresh perspective and approach to a thorough comprehension of cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

However, its specific capacity is limited to the reversible inserting and extracting of two sodium ions per formula unit, which hampers the improvement of its energy density. In this study, we propose a new NASICON-type Na4MnCr(PO4)2F3 (NMCPF) cathode and systematically investigate its key properties using first-principles calculations. NMCPF exhibits the ability to extract/insert three sodium ions per formula unit, resulting in a high specific capacity of 180.34 mAh/g, and demonstrates three-electron redox reactions involving three redox couples of Mn2+/3+ (3.05 V), Mn3+/4+ (4.11 V), and Cr3+/4+ (4.64 V). Consequently, its energy density can reach 709.33 Wh/kg. In addition, NMCPF exhibits a small volume change of 8.2% during the charging/discharging process and sodium ion diffusion properties comparable to those of NVPF. This study demonstrates the potential of NMCPF as a promising cathode material with high energy density for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Based on the favorable ionic conductivity and structural stability, sodium superionic conductor (NASICON) materials especially utilizing multivalent redox reaction of vanadium are one of the most promising cathodes in sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). To further boost their application in large‐scale energy storage production, a rational strategy is to tailor vanadium with earth‐abundant and cheap elements (such as Fe, Mn), reducing the cost and toxicity of vanadium‐based NASICON materials. Here, the Na3.05V1.03Fe0.97(PO4)3 (NVFP) is synthesized with highly conductive Ketjen Black (KB) by ball‐milling assisted sol‐gel method. The pearl‐like KB branch chains encircle the NVFP (p‐NVFP), the segregated particles possess promoted overall conductivity, balanced charge, and modulated crystal structure during electrochemical progress. The p‐NVFP obtains significantly enhanced ion diffusion ability and low volume change (2.99%). Meanwhile, it delivers a durable cycling performance (87.7% capacity retention over 5000 cycles at 5 C) in half cells. Surprisingly, the full cells of p‐NVFP reveal a remarkable capability of 84.9 mAh g−1 at 20 C with good cycling performance (capacity decay rate is 0.016% per cycle at 2 C). The structure modulation of the p‐NVFP provides a rational design on the superiority of others to be put into practice.",

        "abstract": "Single-crystal lithium-rich layered oxides (LLOs) with excellent mechanical properties can enhance their crystal structure stability. However, the conventional methods for preparing single-crystal LLOs, require large amounts of molten salt additives, involve complicated washing steps, and increase the difficulty of large-scale production. In this study, a sodium tungstate (Na2 WO4 )-assisted sintering method is proposed to fabricate high-performance single-crystal LLOs cathode materials without large amounts of additives and additional washing steps. During the sintering process, Na2 WO4 promotes particle growth and forms a protective coating on the surface of LLOs particles, effectively suppressing the side reactions at the cathode/electrolyte interface. Additionally, trace amounts of Na and W atoms are doped into the LLOs lattice via gradient doping. Experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that Na and W doping stabilizes the crystal structure and enhances the Li+ ions diffusion rate. The prepared single-crystal LLOs exhibit outstanding capacity retention of 82.7% (compared to 65.0%, after 200 cycles at 1 C) and a low voltage decay rate of 0.76 mV per cycle (compared to 1.80 mV per cycle). This strategy provides a novel pathway for designing the next-generation high-performance cathode materials for Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).",

        "abstract": "P2 layered oxides have attracted more and more attention as cathode materials of high-power sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). During the charging process, the release of sodium ions leads to layer slip, which leads to the transformation of P2 phase into O2 phase, resulting in a sharp decline in capacity. However, many cathode materials do not undergo P2 -O2 transition during charging and discharging, but form a \"Z\" phase. It is proved that the iron-containing compound Na0.67 Ni0.1 Mn0.8 Fe0.1 O2 formed the \"Z\" phase of the symbiotic structure of the P phase and O phase during high-voltage charging through ex-XRD and HAADF-STEM. During the charging process, the cathode material undergoes a structural change of P2 -OP4 -O2 . With the increase of charging voltage, the O-type superposition mode increases to form an ordered OP4 phase, and the P2 -type superposition mode disappears after further charging to form a pure O2 phase. 57 Fe-Mössbauer spectroscopy revealed that no migration of Fe ions is detected. The O-Ni-O-Mn-Fe-O bond formed in the transition metal MO6 (M = Ni, Mn, Fe) octahedron can inhibit the elongation of the Mn-O bond and improve the electrochemical activity so that P2-Na0.67 Ni0.1 Mn0.8 Fe0.1 O2 has an excellent capacity of 172.4 mAh g-1 and a coulombic efficiency close to 99% at 0.1C.",

It is found that the electrolytes containing NaClO4 and NaPF6 exhibit ionic conductivities ranging from 5 mS cm(-1) to 7 mS cm(-1) at ambient temperature. The electrochemical stability window of the different electrolytes is studied by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements with respect to a variety of working electrodes (WE) such as glassy carbon (GC), graphite and a carbon gas diffusion layer (GDL). Electrolytes containing NaPF6 and NaClO4 are found to be electrochemically stable with respect to GC and GDL electrodes up to 4.5 V vs. Na/Na(+), with some side reactions starting from around 3.0 V for the latter salt. The results further show that aluminium is preferred over different steels as a cathode current collector. Copper is stable up to a potential of 3.5 V vs. Na/Na(+). In view of practical Na-ion battery systems, the electrolytes are electrochemically tested with Na0.7CoO2 as a positive electrode.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) see intensive research and commercialization efforts, aiming to establish them as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries. Among the reported cathode material families for SIBs, Na-deficient P2-type layered oxides are promising candidates, benefiting from fast sodium diffusion and therefore high charge/discharge rates. However, upon sodium extraction at high potentials, a transition from the P2 to O2 phase occurs, with the corresponding change in cell volume resulting in particle fracture and capacity degradation. A possible solution to this is to increase configurational entropy by introducing more elements into the transition-metal layer (so-called high-entropy concept), leading to some kind of structural stabilization. In this work, the acoustic emission (AE) of a series of P2-type layered oxide cathodes with increasing configurational entropy [Na0.67(Mn0.55Ni0.21Co0.24)O2, Na0.67(Mn0.45Ni0.18Co0.24Ti0.1Mg0.03)O2 and Na0.67(Mn0.45Ni0.18Co0.18Ti0.1Mg0.03Al0.04Fe0.02)O2] is recorded during SIB operation and correlated to the materials properties, namely change in c lattice parameter and cracking behavior. A structure-property relationship between entropy, manifested in the extent of phase transition, and detected AE is derived, supported by the classification of signals by peak frequency. This classification in combination with microscopy imaging allows to distinguish between inter- and intragranular fracture. Relatively more intergranular and less intragranular crack formation is observed with increasing configurational entropy.",

In situ HEXRD and ex situ TEM measurements indicate that an irreversible phase transition occurs upon sodium insertion-extraction of Na0.66Ni0.33Mn0.67O2. Zinc doping of this system results in a high structural reversibility. XAFS measurements indicate that both materials are almost completely dependent on the Ni(4+)/Ni(3+)/Ni(2+) redox couple to provide charge/discharge capacity. SS-NMR measurements indicate that both reversible and irreversible migration of transition metal ions into the sodium layer occurs in the material at the fully charged state. The irreversible migration of transition metal ions triggers a structural distortion, leading to the observed capacity and voltage fading.

P2 type material possesses its preponderant open diffusion pathway that leads to great rate performance. Herein we reported a novel P2 phase cathode material Na0.75Ni1/3Ru1/6Mn1/2O2 (NRM). The NRM cathode could deliver a high capacity of 161.5 mAh g-1, represents excellent rate performance (when the rate increases from 0.2C to 10C the capacity keeps 74%) and maintains 79.5% for 500 cycles even at 10C high rate. In-situ X-ray diffraction was also conducted to reveal the structural evolution during cycling. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique was carried out and the calculated Na+ diffusion coefficient is extremely high among Mn-based layered oxides. This material expresses good electrochemical property notably excellent rate performance, which will well promote the commercialization of SIBs, especially the fast-charging or high-power batteries.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries have recently emerged as a promising alternative to lithium‐based batteries, driven by an ever‐growing demand for electricity storage systems. The present workproposes a cobalt‐free high‐capacity cathode for sodium‐ion batteries, synthesized using a high‐entropy approach. The high‐entropy approach entails mixing more than five elements in a single phase; hence, obtaining the desired properties is a challenge since this involves the interplay between different elements. Here, instead of oxide, oxyfluoride is chosen to suppress oxygen loss during long‐term cycling. Supplement to this, lithium is introduced in the composition to obtain high configurational entropy and sodium vacant sites, thus stabilizing the crystal structure, accelerating the kinetics of intercalation/deintercalation, and improving the air stability of the material. With the optimization of the cathode composition, a reversible capacity of 109 mAh g−1 (2–4 V) and 144 mAh g−1 (2–4.3 V) is observed in the first few cycles, along with a significant improvement in stability during prolonged cycling. Furthermore, in situ and ex situ diffraction studies during charging/discharging reveal that the high‐entropy strategy successfully suppresses the complex phase transition. The impressive outcomes of the present work strongly motivate the pursuit of the high‐entropy approach to develop efficient cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries.",

These materials require excess Li compared to stoichiometric composition to improve the electrochemical performance in terms of rate capability and cycling stability. Although lithium-to-transition metal ratios up to 1.15 can be used to optimize the performance, less than 80% of this lithium is electrochemically active during cycling up to a 4.4 V upper cut off. This study explores whether some percentage of the inactive Li can be replaced by sodium to make these materials more cost-effective and bring potential improvements in electrochemical performance. Various amounts of excess Li were substituted by sodium in the structure. The results show that sodium can be integrated into the layered oxide structure without forming any impurity phases and effectively decreases the cation mixing observed in these layered structures. However, this does compromise cycling stability and rate capability. Na tends to occupy Li sites rather than transition metal sites, resulting in electrochemical instability and capacity loss. Even though excess Li is not electrochemically active, it cannot be effectively replaced by sodium without compromising battery performance of Li1+x(Ni0.6Mn0.4)1-xO2 materials.",

Mn-based oxide cathodes have received wide attention due to their sustainable nature, low cost, elemental abundance, structural diversity/polymorphism, and rich oxidation states (2+ to 7+), offering tunable redox potential [1]. Here, we have investigated different oxide-based cathode insertion compounds for secondary metal-ion batteries.\n i) We have demonstrated tunnel-type sodium insertion material Na44MnO2(NMO) as an intercalation host for Li-ion and K-ion batteries. The solution combustion synthesized Na0.44MnO2 assuming an orthorhombic structure (space group Pbam), exhibited rod-like morphology. After electrochemical ion exchange from NMO, we obtained Na0.11K0.27MnO2 (NKMO) and Na0.18Li0.51MnO2 (NLMO) cathodes for K-ion batteries and Li-ion batteries, respectively [2]. These new compositions, NKMO and NLMO, showed excellent cycling stability with capacities of ∼74 and 141 mAh g–1 (first cycle, C/20 current rate). The underlying mechanistic features concerning charge storage and structural modifications in these cathode compositions were probed by combining ex-situ structural, spectroscopy, and electrochemical tools [3].\n ii) Using composite formation, we have tried to improve the P2-type layered material. Here, the stable Na7(Li1/18Mn1/18Ni3/18Fe2/18χ1/18)O2–xNa2MoO4 biphasic composite was synthesized using Mo doping.

        "abstract": "The Fe-based Prussian blue (Fe-PB) composite is considered as one of the most potential cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries because of its abundant iron resources and high theoretical capacity. However, the crystal water and vacancy in the Fe-PB structure will lead to poor capacity and cycle stability. In this work, a Cu-modified Fe-PB composite (FeCu-PB@CuO) is successfully prepared through regulating the Fe-PB structure by Cu doping and engineering the surface by CuO coating. The density functional theory calculation results confirm that Cu preferentially replaces FeHS in the Fe-PB lattice and Cu doping reduces the bandgap. Our experiment results reveal that CuO coating can provide more active sites, inhibit side reactions, and potentially enhance the activity of FeHS. Due to the synergistic effect of Cu doping and CuO coating, FeCu-PB@CuO has a considerable initial discharge capacity of 123.5 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1. In particular, at 2 A g-1, it delivers an impressive initial capacity of 84.3 mAh g-1, and the capacity decreasing rate of each cycle is only 0.02% over 1500 cycles. Therefore, the synergistic modification strategy of metal ion doping and metal oxide coating has tremendous application potential and can be extended to other electrode materials.",

It is worth noting that after 180 cycles of charging and discharging at a gradually increasing current density such as 50-1000 mA g-1, it can still return to the original level after returning to 50 mA g-1. Excellent electrochemical performance and capacity stability show that NMTO-5 material is a promising electrode material.",

Employing this microreactor, Fe-PBAs were synthesized with a meticulous approach that led to a material possessing a well-defined morphology and a stoichiometry of Na1.54Fe[Fe(CN)6]0.93. The material exhibited a notable reduction in vacancy defects and minimized oxidation levels. Upon electrochemical evaluation, the Fe-PBA crafted within the microreactor demonstrated an impressive specific capacity of 94.1 mAh/g at a current density of 0.5 C and showcased a long-term cyclability with 72.6% capacity retention over 2000 cycles. Comparative analysis revealed that the structural and electrochemical properties of Fe-PBA prepared in the microreactor outperformed those of samples prepared using traditional reactors.

        "title": "Uncovering the Structural Evolution in Na-Excess Layered Cathodes for Rational Use of an Anionic Redox Reaction.",
        "abstract": "A new paradigm based on an anionic O2-/On- redox reaction has been highlighted in high-energy-density cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries, achieving a high voltage (~4.2 V vs. Na+/Na) with a large anionic capacity during the first charge process. The structural variations during (de)intercalation are closely correlated with stable cycleability. To determine the rational range of the anion-based redox reaction, the structural origins of Na1-xRu0.5O1.5 (0≤x≤1.0) were deduced from its vacancy(□)/Na atomic configurations, which trigger different coulombic interactions between the cations and anions. In the cation-based Ru4+/Ru5+ redox reaction, the □-solubility into fully sodiated Na2RuO3 predominantly depends on the crystallographic 4h-site when 0.0≤x≤0.25, and coulombic repulsion of the linear O2--□-O2- configuration is accompanied by increased volumetric strain. Further Na extraction (0.25≤x≤0.5) induces a compensation effect leading to Na2/3[Na□Ru2/3]O2 with the □-formation of 2b and 2c sites, which drastically reduce the volumetric strain. In the O2-/On- anionic redox region (0.5≤x≤0.75), Na removal at the 4h site generates a repulsive force in O2--□-O2- that increases the interlayer distance. Finally, in the 0.75≤x≤1.0 region, the anionic O charges are unprotected by repulsive forces and their consumption causes severe volumetric strain in Na1-xRu0.5O1.5. Coupling our mechanistic understanding of the structural origin with the □- and Na-site preferences and the coulombic interaction between lattice O and vacancies in Na1-xRu0.5O1.5, we determined the rational range of the anionic redox reaction in layered cathode materials for rechargeable battery research.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have captured widespread attention for grid-scale energy storage owing to the wide distribution and low cost of sodium resources. Delivery of high energy density with stable retention remains a challenge in developing cathode candidates for rechargeable SIBs. Inspired by the concept of \"cationic potential\", here, we present a hierarchical crystalline domain in hexagonal particles with target chemical composition (Na0.8Li0.03Mg0.05Ni0.28Fe0.05Mn0.54Ti0.05O2) from the inner bulk O3 phase (71.1 wt %) to the outer P2-type shell (28.9 wt %) of the structure. Benefiting from the mitigated mechanical stress of the predominant bulk O3 phase under the protection of the surficial P2 crystalline domain at the microscale during Na+ (de)intercalation, the brittle fracture, plastic yielding, and structural damage of the bulk O3 phase are effectively prohibited during battery cycling, thereby achieving good structural integrity. As a consequence, the biphasic P2/O3-Na0.8Li0.03Mg0.05Ni0.28Fe0.05Mn0.54Ti0.05O2 material exhibits satisfactory electrochemical properties, with a high energy density of 506 Wh kg-1 and good capacity retention of 85.5% over 200 cycles.

However, the inferior electronic conductivity and sluggish reaction kinetics limit its practical applications. Herein, we successfully constructed a three-dimensional cross-linked porous architecture NMTP material (AsN@NMTP/C) by a natural microbe of Aspergillus niger (AsN), and the structure of different NMTP cathodes was optimized by adjusting different transition metal Mn/Ti ratios. Both approaches effectively altered the three-dimensional NMTP structure, not only improving electronic conductivity and controlling Na+ diffusion pathways but also enhancing the electrochemical kinetics of the material. The resultant AsN@NMTP/C-650, sintered at 650 °C, exhibits better electrochemical performance with higher reversible three-electron reactions corresponding to the voltage platforms of Ti4+/3+, Mn3+/2+, and Mn4+/3+ around 2.1, 3.6, and 4.1 V (vs Na+/Na), respectively. The capacity retention rate is up to 89.3% after 1000 cycles at a 2C rate. Moreover, a series of results confirms that the Na3.4Mn1.2Ti0.8(PO4)3 cathode has the most excellent electrochemical performance when the Mn/Ti ratio is 1.2/0.8, with a high capacity of 96.59 mAh g-1 and 97.1% capacity retention after 500 cycles.",

However, SIBs operating under elevated temperature aggravate the electrolyte decomposition with unstable cathode‐electrolyte interphase (CEI), causing a rapid capacity degradation. Herein, anion receptor tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (TPFPB) is selected as electrolyte additive to construct robust NaF‐rich CEI. The strong interactions between anion and TPFPB via the electron‐deficient boron atoms weaken ClO4− solvation and promote the coordination capability between solvents and Na+ cations, demonstrating greatly improved oxidative stability. Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode in TPFPB‐containing electrolyte delivers long‐term stability with a capacity retention of 86.9% after 100 cycles at a high cut‐off voltage of 4.2 V (vs. Na+/Na) and a high temperature of 60 °C.

        "abstract": "Sodium layered oxide with anion redox activity (SLO‐A) stands out as a promising cathode material for sodium‐ion batteries due to its impressive capacity and high voltage resulting from Mn‐ and O‐redox processes. However, the SLO‐A faces significant challenges in cycling stability and rate performance, primarily due to the poor reversibility and sluggish kinetics of the O‐redox. In this study,a novel Ti‐doped material, Na2/3Li2/9Mn53/72Ti1/24O2 (NLMTO), exhibiting remarkable characteristics such as a notable rate capacity (130 mAh g−1 at 3C, where 1C equals 200 mA g−1) and excellent cycling retention (85.4% after 100 cycles at 0.5C) is introduced. Employing electrochemical differential analyses, the contributions to the superior performance arising from the Mn‐ and O‐redox processes are quantitatively delineated. The optimized performance of NLMTO is attributed, in part, to the enhanced stability of both bulk and interface structures. The introduction of Ti through substitution not only contributes to this stability but also allows for the fine‐tuning of the material's electron configurations. This is achieved by augmenting the density of states near the Fermi energy level, as well as elevating the O 2p and Mn 3d orbits. This research advances sodium‐ion battery technology.",

The migration energy barrier and Na ion diffusion kinetics are studied using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique.

Here, we introduce a 4.0 V class high-voltage cathode material with a newly recognized sodium superionic conductor (NASICON)-type structure with cubic symmetry (space group P 2 1 3), Na 3 V(PO 3 ) 3 N. We synthesize an N-doped graphene oxide wrapped Na 3 V(PO 3 ) 3 N composite with a uniform carbon coating layer, and it shows both excellent rate performance and outstanding cycling stability. Its air/water stability and all-climate performance are carefully investigated in detail. Near-zero volume change (~0.40%) is clearly observed for the first time based on in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, and the in-situ X-ray absorption spectra reveal the V 3.2+ /V 4.2+ redox reaction with high reversibility. Its three-dimensional sodium diffusion pathways are explicitly demonstrated with distinctive low energy barriers. Higher reversible capacity and a higher working platform can surely be achieved if the electrolyte possesses a wider voltage tolerance window above 4.8 V. Our comprehensive results indicate that this high-voltage new NASICON-type Na 3 V(PO 3 ) 3 N composite can be considered as a competitive candidate cathode material for sodium-ion batteries and will receive more extensive attention and studies in the future.",

        "abstract": "The practical application of room temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries are prevented by the sulfur insulation, the severe shuttling effect of high‐order sodium polysulfides (Na2Sn, 4 ≤ n ≤ 8), and the sluggish reaction kinetics. Therefore, designing an ideal host material to suppress the polysulfides shuttle process and accelerate the redox reactions of soluble NaPSs to Na2S2/Na2S is of paramount importance for RT Na–S batteries. Here, a quasi‐solid‐state transformation of NaPSs is realized by building high efficiency MoC‐W2C heterostructure in freestanding multichannel carbon nanofibers via electrospinning and calcination methods (MoC‐W2C‐MCNFs). The multichannel carbon nanofibers are interlinked micro‐mesoporous structures that can accommodate volume change of electrode materials and confine the entire redox process of NaPSs (restraining the polysulfides shuttle process). Meanwhile, the MoC‐W2C heterostructure with abundant heterointerfaces can facilitate electron/ion transport and accelerate conversion of NaPSs. Consequently, the S/MoC‐W2C‐MCNFs cathode delivers a high capacity of 640 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 0.2 A g−1 and an excellent reversible performance of 200 mAh g−1 after ultralong 3500 cycles at 4 A g−1.

        "abstract": "There are still many problems that hinder the development of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), including poor rate performance, short-term cycle lifespan, and inferior low-temperature property. Herein, excellent Na-storage performance in fluorophosphate (Na3 V2 (PO4 )2 F3 ) cathode is achieved by lattice regulation based on charge balance theory. Lattice regulation of aliovalent Mn2+ for V3+ increases both electronic conductivity and Na+ -migration kinetics. Because of the maintaining of electrical neutrality in the material, aliovalent Mn2+ -introduced leads to the coexistence of V3+ and V4+ from charge balance theory. It decreases the particle size and improves the structural stability, suppressing the large lattice distortion during cathode reaction processes. These multiple effects enhance the specific capacity (123.8 mAh g-1 ), outstanding high-rate (68% capacity retention at 20 C), ultralong cycle (only 0.018% capacity attenuation per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1 C) and low-temperature (96.5% capacity retention after 400 cycles at -25 °C) performances of Mn2+ -induced Na3 V1.98 Mn0.02 (PO4 )2 F3 when used as cathode in SIBs.

In this study, we investigate the origin of capacity fading in P2-type layered sodium cathode materials for SIBs using a micron-sized single-crystalline P2-Na x Mn 3/4 Ni 1/4 O 2 model cathode active material. Using various electrochemical techniques, we identify the following aging effects upon cycling: (i) a state of charge (SOC)- independent increase in polarization, (ii) a SOC-dependent increase in polarization at high voltage, and (iii) a loss of active material due to electronic disconnection after prolonged cycling. With high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, we identify surface densification, resulting in 5 − 10 nm thick surface layers on cycled cathode active materials as the origin for SOC-independent increase of polarization. The corresponding oxygen loss is in accordance with gas evolution in differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) measurements. Furthermore, with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) electrode cross sections, we identify (partly) reversible cracking at a high SOC as the cause for increased polarization depending on SOC. Operando X-ray diffraction (XRD) identifies significant anisotropic volume change, which suggests mechanical stress as the cause for cracking at a high SOC and loss of active material after prolonged cycling.

        "abstract": "Rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs), with abundant aluminum reserves, low cost, and high safety, give them outstanding advantages in the postlithium batteries era. However, the high charge density (364 C mm−3) and large binding energy of three‐electron‐charge aluminum ions (Al3+) de‐intercalation usually lead to irreversible structural deterioration and decayed battery performance. Herein, to mitigate these inherent defects from Al3+, an unexplored family of superlattice‐type tungsten selenide‐sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) (S‐WSe2) cathode in RABs with a stably crystal structure, expanded interlayer, and enhanced Al‐ion diffusion kinetic process is proposed. Benefiting from the unique advantage of superlattice‐type structure, the anionic surfactant SDBS in S‐WSe2 can effectively tune the interlayer spacing of WSe2 with released crystal strain from high‐charge‐density Al3+ and achieve impressively long‐term cycle stability (110 mAh g−1 over 1500 cycles at 2.0 A g−1). Meanwhile, the optimized S‐WSe2 cathode with intrinsic negative attraction of SDBS significantly accelerates the Al3+ diffusion process with one of the best rate performances (165 mAh g−1 at 2.0 A g−1) in RABs. The findings of this study pave a new direction toward durable and high‐performance electrode materials for RABs.",

        "title": "Suppressing Cation Migration and Reducing Particle Cracks in a Layered Fe-Based Cathode for Advanced Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have huge potential in large-scale energy storage applications. Layered Fe-based oxides are one of the desirable cathode materials due to abundance in the earth crust and high activity in electrochemical processes. However, Fe-ion migration to Na layers is one of the major hurdles leading to irreversible structural degradation. Herein, it is revealed that distinct Fe-ion migration in cycling NaFeO2 (NFO) should be mainly responsible for the strong local lattice strain and resulting particle cracks, all of which results in the deterioration of electrochemical performance. More importantly, a strategy of Ru doping could effectively suppress the Fe-ion migration and then reduce the local lattice strain and the particle cracks, finally to greatly enhance the sodium storage performance. Atomic-scale characterization shows that NFO electrode after cycling presents the intense lattice strain locally, accompanied by the remarkable particle cracks. Whereas, Ru-doped NFO electrode maintains the well-ordered layered structure by inhibiting the Fe-O distortion, so as to eliminate the resulting side effect. As a result, Ru-doped NFO could greatly improve the comprehensive electrochemical performance by delivering a reversible capacity of 120 mA h g-1 , about 80% capacity retention after 100 cycles. The findings provide new insights for designing high-performance electrodes for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Development of high-performance cathode materials is one of the key challenges in the practical application of sodium-ion batteries. Among all the cathode materials, layered sodium transition-metal oxides are particularly attractive. However, undesired phase transitions are often reported and have detrimental effects on the structure stability and electrochemical performance. Cu substitution of zinc in the P2-type Na0.6Mn0.7Ni0.15Zn0.15-xCuxO2 (x = 0, 0.075, and 0.15) composites was investigated in this study for mitigating the biphase transition and enhancing the electrochemical performance of sodium-ion batteries. The coupling effect of Zn and Cu enables an excellent capacity retention of 96.4% of the initial discharge capacity after 150 cycles at 0.1 C in the Na/Na0.6Mn0.7Ni0.15Zn0.075Cu0.075O2 cell. The biphase transition that occurred in the high voltage range has been significantly suppressed after the incorporation of Cu in Na0.6Mn0.7Ni0.15Zn0.15O2, which was confirmed by in situ X-ray diffraction studies. Moreover, the substitution of the inert element Zn with electrochemically active Cu leads to the suppression of anionic redox and the occurrence of Cu2+/3+ redox reaction, and the electrolyte decomposition is impeded after the introduction of electrochemically active Cu in the Na0.6Mn0.7Ni0.15Zn0.15-xCuxO2 composite cathode. The enhanced electrochemical performance in the Na0.6Mn0.7Ni0.15Zn0.075Cu0.075O2 electrode can be ascribed to the coexistence of Zn and Cu and alleviated volumetric change as well as suppressed electrode/electrolyte side reaction after Cu substitution.",

The process involves in-situ production of sodium oxides in the controlled oxygen environment at the cathode. Subsequently, the cathode composed of sodium oxide compositions is assembled into a Na-metal architecture to do performance study and analysis. Our results indicated that the designed Na-metal battery demonstrates stable performance over 50 cycles with an overpotential of less than 100 mV and a coulombic efficiency exceeding 99%. Various electrochemical and physicochemical characterization techniques, including Raman spectroscopy, X-Ray diffraction analysis (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), were employed to gain insight into cell chemistry and mixed ion-electron conduction mechanism.

        "abstract": "Iron trifluoride (FeF3), a conversion-type cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), is based on cheap and abundant Fe and provides high theoretical capacity. However, the applications of FeF3-based SIBs have been hindered by their low-capacity utilization and poor cycling stability. Herein, we report greatly enhanced performance of FeF3 in multiple types of ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes at both room temperature (RT) and elevated temperatures. The Pyr1,4FSI electrolyte demonstrated the best cycling stability with an unprecedented decay rate of only ∼0.023% per cycle after the initial stabilization and an average coulombic efficiency of ∼99.5% for over 1000 cycles at RT. The Pyr1,3FSI electrolyte demonstrated the best cycling stability with a capacity decay rate of only ∼0.25% per cycle at 60 °C. Cells using Pyr1,3FSI and EMIMFSI electrolytes also showed promising cycling stability with capacity decay rates of ∼0.039% and ∼0.030% per cycle over 1000 cycles, respectively. A protective and ionically conductive cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer is formed during cycling in ILs, diminishing side reactions that commonly lead to gassing and excessive CEI growth in organic electrolytes, especially at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the increased ionic conductivity and decreased viscosity of ILs at elevated temperatures help attain higher accessible capacity. The application of ILs sheds light on designing a protective CEI for its use in stable SIBs.",

Nevertheless, they still suffer fast capacity loss and voltage decay, as a result of the layered structure instability upon extended electrochemical cycling. The mechanism underlying such instability remains poorly understood. Here we unravel the TM migrations and structural evolution of a quaternary NaNi0.3Co0.12Mn0.18Fe0.4O2 compound during electrochemical cycling using atomic resolution electron microscopy and associated spectroscopies. We discover successive migrations of TM ions to Na layers that account for structure and performance degradations. The Fe ions migrate into the interstices of both tetrahedra and octahedra of the layers, whereas the Ni ions dominantly in the octahedral ones, and the Mn and Co ions mostly remain in the TM layers. Direct atomic-level observations of the TM migration process upon cycling offer a deep insight into designing high capacity and high cycle lifespan cathode materials for sodium ion batteries.",

A double-tilt TEM heating holder was used to directly characterize the changes in the morphology and the crystallographic and electronic structures of the materials with increase in temperature. The electron diffraction patterns and the electron energy loss spectra demonstrated the presence of cobalt oxides (Co3O4, CoO) and even metallic cobalt (Co) at higher temperatures as a result of reduction of Co ions and loss of oxygen. The bright-field TEM images revealed that the surface of NaxCoO2 becomes porous at high temperatures. Higher cutoff voltages result in degrading thermal stability of NaxCoO2. The observations herein provide a valuable insight that thermal stability is one of the important factors to be considered in addition to the electrochemical properties when developing new electrode materials for novel battery systems.",

However, the high diffusion barrier has hindered its application. In this work, we have theoretically studied the relationship between the strain and the diffusion barrier/path of sodium ions in layered CrN2 by first-principles calculation. Our results show that the strain can not only effectively decrease the diffusion barrier but also change the sodium diffusion path, which can be realized by alkali metal intercalation. Moreover, the diffusion barrier is as low as 0.04 eV with the Cs atoms embedding in layered CrN2 (Cs1/16CrN2), suggesting an excellent candidate cathode for SIBs. In addition, the decrease of the barrier mainly originated from the fact that interlayer electronic coupling weakened with the increase of interlayer spacing. Our findings provide an effective way to enhance sodium diffusion performance, which is beneficial for the design of SIB electrode materials.",

A significant improvement in structural and electrochemical performance is required to broaden the future applications of sodium‐based layered oxide materials for Na‐ion batteries. In this work, O3‐type NaNi(1‐x)/2Mn(1‐x)/2MoxO2 (x=0, 0.05,0.1) layered oxide cathode materials were synthesized by solid‐state reaction method, and its structural, thermal and electrochemical performance in Sodium (Na) ion battery was investigated. The structural analysis reveals that a single phase highly crystalline O3‐type cathode material with irregular particle shape was formed. The introduction of molybdenum (Mo) improves the thermal stability of cathode materials, which can be attributed to the improved TMO2 layers that provide stability to the material. The addition of Mo to Na layered oxide cathode materials influences their electrochemical performance. In comparison, the developed cathode materials, the NaNi0.475Mn0.475Mo0.05O2, exhibited excellent specific discharge capacity (∽154mAh/g) at C/20 rate, (an increase of ∽20% when compared to the NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2) which can be attributed to the increased capacitance effect by the addition of Mo. The EIS study reveals that the diffusion of Na+ into/from the host structure is rapid during the first cycle and then gradually reduces with subsequent cycling due to the formation of the SEI layer, which hinders Na+ migration. This has a potential effect on the improved electrochemical performance of the material.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

Herein, composed with similar composition, ARRs induced oxygen behaviors within O3-Na0.6Li0.2Fe0.4Ru0.4O2 and P2-Na0.6Li0.35Fe0.1Ru0.55O2 are systematically investigated by varying ex/in-situ spectroscopic characterizations. Conducted with lower charging cut-off voltage (4.0 V), P2-type cathode will be easier to trigger the reversible oxygen behaviors and delivers a larger capacity, better rate performance as well as stable cyclability, in contrast to the O3-type cathode. Moreover, within O3-type structure, increasing charging potential (beyond 4.3 V) would induce additional anionic oxidation capacity, but inevitably lead to the irreversible evolution of gaseous O2 and superoxo. With the unique feature, this work provides a promising strategy design for fabricating cathodes with optimal microstructural arrangement, which could further push forward the changes in macro/nano structure and even the ideal performance.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as a compelling alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), exhibiting comparable electrochemical performance while capitalizing on the abundant availability of sodium resources. In SIBs, P2/O3 biphasic cathodes, despite their high energy, require furthur improvements in stability to meet current energy demands. This study introduces a systematic methodology that leverages the meta-heuristically assisted NSGA-II algorithm to optimize multi-element doping in electrode materials, aiming to transcend conventional trial-and-error methods and enhance cathode capacity by the synergistic integration of P2 and O3 phases. A comprehensive phase analysis of the meta-heuristically designed cathode material Na0.76Ni0.20Mn0.42Fe0.30Mg0.04Ti0.015Zr0.025O2 (D-NFMO) is presented, showcasing its remarkable initial reversible capacity of 175.5 mAh g-1 and exceptional long-term cyclic stability in sodium cells. The investigation of structural composition and the stabilizing mechanisms is performed through the integration of multiple characterization techniques. Remarkably, the irreversible phase transition of P2→OP4 in D-NFMO is observed to be dramatically suppressed, leading to a substantial enhancement in cycling stability. The comparison with the pristine cathode (P-NFMO) offers profound insights into the long-term electrochemical stability of D-NFMO, highlighting its potential as a high-voltage cathode material utilizing abundant earth elements in SIBs. This study opens up new possibilities for future advancements in sodium-ion battery technology.",

However, the phase transformations during repeated (dis)charge steps lead to rapid capacity decay and deteriorated Na+ diffusion kinetics. Moreover, the electrode manufacturing based on polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) binder system has been reported with severely defluorination issue as well as the energy intensive and expensive process due to the use of toxic and volatile N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent. It calls for designing a sustainable, better performing, and cost-effective binder for positive electrode manufacturing. In this work, we investigated inorganic sodium metasilicate (SMS) as a viable binder in conjunction with P2-Na0.67Mn0.55Ni0.25Fe0.1Ti0.1O2 (NMNFT) cathode material for SIBs. The NMNFT-SMS electrode delivered a superior electrochemical performance compared to carboxy methylcellulose (CMC) and PVDF based electrodes with a reversible capacity of ~161 mAh/g and retaining ~83% after 200 cycles. Lower cell impedance and faster Na+ diffusion was also observed in this binder system. With these findings, SMS binder can be proposed as a powerful multifunctional binder to enable positive electrode manufacturing of SIBs and to overall reduce battery manufacturing costs.",

Here, tunnel-type sodium insertion material Na0.44MnO2 is demonstrated as an intercalation host for Li-ion and K-ion batteries. The rod-shaped Na0.44MnO2 was synthesized by a solution combustion method assuming an orthorhombic structure (space group Pbam), which led to Na0.11K0.27MnO2 (NKMO) and Na0.18Li0.51MnO2 (NLMO) cathodes for K-ion batteries and Li-ion batteries, respectively, via facile electrochemical ion exchange from Na0.44MnO2.

The underlying mechanistic aspects (structural changes and charge storage mechanism) in these cathode compositions were probed by combining ex situ structural, spectroscopy, and electrochemical tools.

Nevertheless, it undergoes complicated phase transitions and pronounced structural degradation during the cycling of charge/discharge process, rendering severe volumetric strain and poor cycling performance. Herein, a zero‐strain high‐entropy NaNi0.2Fe0.2Mn0.35Cu0.05Zn0.1Sn0.1O2 cathode for SIBs is presented by high‐entropy phase stabilization engineering. It is verified that this low‐nickel cobalt‐free high‐entropy cathode can deliver a highly reversible phase evolution, zero volumetric strain, and a significantly improved cycling performance in full cells (87% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 3.0 C). Combining X‐ray absorption spectra and first‐principles calculations, the varied elemental functions in the high‐entropy framework are clearly elucidated, namely, Ni/Fe/Cu acts as charge compensators, while Mn/Zn/Sn serve as interlayer slipping inhibitors through enhanced charge localization besides their stable valence states. By addressing the volumetric strain and cycling instability concerns for O3‐type cathode materials, this work presents a promising strategy for inhibiting irreversible phase transitions and structural degradation in intercalation electrodes, which significantly boosts the development of commercially feasible cathodes for high‐performance SIBs.",

Here, a facile and effective approach that can be used to overcome these disadvantages by introducing an aqueous carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binder is reported. The resulting conductive network serves to accelerate the diffusion of Na+ ions across the interface as well as in the bulk. The strong binding force of the CMC and stable solid permeable interface protect the electrode from degradation, leading to an excellent capacity of 75 mA h g−1 at an ultrahigh rate of 70 C (1 C = 128 mA g−1) and a long lifespan of 3500 cycles at 30 C while sustaining 79% of the initial capacity value.

Na3FePO4CO3 and Na3MnPO4CO3 are estimated to be promising candidates for the cathode materials of sodium ion batteries because of the moderate voltages, good stability and high safety during the cycling process of two sodium ions per formula unit. For the purpose of improving the rate performances, Na3MnPO4CO3 was chosen as an example to explore its surface performance. The surface energies, equilibrium morphology, redox potentials and electronic conductivities of surfaces are explored in detail. The results suggest that (010), (001), (111) and (110) orientations are the dominating surfaces in the Wulff shape, while the surfaces (010) and (001) possess high second surface redox potentials, corresponding to the unsatisfactory specific capacity and ionic conductivity. Moreover, low surface band gaps are discovered in all orientations, which gives a good explanation for the enhanced electronic conductivity as a consequence of decreasing particle size. In addition, the (110), (101) and (12-1) surfaces display significantly lower surface band gaps and comparatively lower second redox potentials, thus enlarging the relative surface areas of surfaces (110), (101) and (12-1) could be an efficient methodology to further improve the specific capacity and electronic conductivity of the Na3MnPO4CO3 material.",

        "abstract": "Vanadium-based phosphates are being extensively studied as an important family of sodium-ion battery (SIB) cathodes. Among many compositions, NaVOPO4 is considered because of various polymorphs and the high redox potential of V4+/5+. However, due to relatively poor intrinsic kinetics and electronic conductivity, approaches such as nanostructuring and carbon composites are commonly used to avoid fast performance degradation. Being different from mainstream approaches, this work utilizes the knowledge gained from potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) and applies layered KVOPO4, a PIB cathode material, as a SIB cathode material. The results demonstrate that KVOPO4 experiences an electrochemical K+-Na+ exchange during the initial cycle and a Na-dominated (de)intercalation process in the following cycles. The initial exchange results in a small amount of K+ (∼0.1 K per formula) remaining in the interlayer space and owing to the larger size of K+ than Na+, the residual K+ effectively acts as ‘pillars’ to expand interlayer spacing and facilitates the Na (de)intercalation, leading to enhanced reversible Na storage and diffusion kinetics of KVOPO4 compared to its Na counterpart NaVOPO4. KVOPO4 delivers an initial discharge capacity of 120 mAh g−1 (90% of the theoretical capacity) at 10 mA g−1 and retains 88% capacity after 150 cycles. It also delivers 52 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 91% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 100 mA g−1, completely outperforming NaVOPO4.",

This study comprehensively investigates NaNMC811 from multiple perspectives. For the first time, the phase evolution ( P 3 ¯ m 1 $P\\overline{3}m1$ - F m 3 ¯ m $Fm\\overline{3}m$ - R 3 ¯ m $R\\overline{3}m$ ) during the solid-state synthesis is systemically investigated, which elucidates in-depth the mechanisms of the thermal sodiation process. Furthermore, an Al-gradient doping of NaNMC811 was successfully implemented through Al2O3 coating on the cathode active material (CAM) precursor. The modified Al-NaNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (Al-NaNMC811) exhibits excellent electrochemical dynamics and performance, maintaining a specific capacity above 100 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 C (1.5-4.1 V) while providing a promising capacity retention of 63%. Additionally, the material demonstrates excellent rate capabilities, retaining a specific capacity of 107 mAh g-1 at 5 C. Compared to pristine NaNMC811, the modified Al-NaNMC811 is proven to have improved electrochemical kinetics with a higher Na+ diffusion coefficient due to dilated (003) interplanar spacing, and a more stable structure during the electrochemical charge-discharge processes, which is attributed to stronger Al-O bond energy. Understanding phase formations during the synthesis and comprehensive insight in the gradient doping for O3-type NaNMC811 CAMs guides further development of next-generation SIBs materials.",

Various strategies have been developed to form ion-exchanged NVOPF which can enhance the ionic and electronic conductivity. However, the underlying ion transport mechanism and complex structural transitions during battery operation remained uninvestigated. In this work, we prepared lithium-exchanged NVOPF (namely NLVOPF) which shows improved ionic conductivity and increased capacity at high discharging rates. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) revealed the distinctive presence of two kinds of Li-exchanged sites in the NLVOPF, which are attributed to the occupied lithium ions at the Na1 and Na2 sites (namely Li1 and Li2, respectively). The Li1 site was metastably replaced in the first cycle, yet the Li2 site participated in ion insertion/extraction in the subsequent cycles. Our characterizations show that the dynamic doping of lithium in NLVOPF could contribute to the improved cycling stability and capacity retention.",

However, its poor electronic conductivity and severe volume expansion during sodium storage need to be addressed before its intensive application could be realized. Herein, we synthesize boron-doped NVP through a facile electrospinning method. By adding boric acid into the reaction mixture during electrospinning followed by carbonization, boron could be directly inserted into the carbon matrix, giving rise to B-doped carbon nanofiber wrapped NVP. By tuning the doping amount, the boron-containing configurations can be facilely manipulated which play different roles in promoting the sodium storage properties of the composite. Based on the calculation results, BC 2 O enhances sodium diffusion by lowering the energy barrier, while BCO 2 improves the structural stability. Due to these specific functionalities of the configurations, the as-prepared composite with a balanced amount of BC 2 O and BCO 2 demonstrates superior sodium storage capacity of 113 mA h g -1 at 1 C, outstanding long cycling performance of 103 mA h g -1 at 10 C and retains 91 mA h g -1 after 1500 cycles.

        "abstract": "Copper Sulfide (CuS) semiconductors have garnered interest, but the effect of transition metal doping on charge carrier kinetics and bandgap remains unclear. In this study, the interactions between dopant atoms (Nickel, Cobalt, and Manganese) and the CuS lattice using spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis are explored. The findings show that sp-d exchange interactions between band electrons and the dopant ions, which replace Cu2+, are key to altering the material's properties. Specifically, these interactions result in a reduced bandgap by shifting the conduction and valence band edges and increasing carrier concentration. It is observed that undoped CuS nanoflowers exhibit a carrier lifetime of 2.16 ns, whereas Mn-doped CuS shows an extended lifetime of 2.62 ns. This increase is attributed to longer carrier scattering times (84 ± 5 fs for Mn-CuS compared to 53 ± 14 fs for CuS) and slower trapping (∼1.5 ps) with prolonged de-trapping (∼100 ps) rates. These dopant-induced energy levels enhance mobility and carrier lifetime by reducing recombination rates. This study highlights the potential of doped CuS as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries and emphasizes the applicability of metal sulfides in energy solutions.",

        "abstract": "Layered P2-Na0.67Mn0.67Ni0.33O2 has been considered an attractive cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, it is still burdened with hazardous phase transformation of P2-O2 under high voltage and harmful reactions at the interface of the electrode and electrolyte. These result in unfavorable structural degradation and rapid capacity decay. Herein, a gradient Mg2+ doping approach is proposed to trigger a structural transformation. During the annealing process, the bulk-diffused Mg2+ and surface residual Mg2+ induce the formation of the P2/P3@MgO structure. Consequently, this method combines the merits of the composite phases, bulk doping, and surface modification. In consequence, Na+ diffusion kinetics and electrochemical performances are remarkably enhanced. The cells using P2/P3@MgO show 69.7% capacity retention at 0.2 C within a voltage range of 1.5-4.5 V for 100 cycles, compared with the 42.6% for P2-Na0.67Mn0.67Ni0.33O2.

However, there still exists a knowledge gap regarding the detailed synthesis conditions and the comprehensive performance of the full cell using this material.

Additionally, a full cell using the optimized cathode material was studied, showing promising performance. This research sheds light on the significance of synthesis parameters in tailoring the electrochemical properties of O3-structured NaNi0.33Fe0.33Mn0.33O2 for sodium-ion batteries.

        "abstract": "O3-type layered oxides with high initial sodium content are promising cathode candidates for Na-ion batteries. However, affected by the undesired transition metal slab sliding and reaction with H2O/CO2, their further application is typically hindered by unsatisfactory cycling stability upon charging to high voltage and poor storage stability under humid air. Herein, we demonstrate a Fe/Ti cosubstitution strategy to simultaneously enhance the electrochemical performance and storage stability of pristine O3-NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 cathode material, via employing high redox potential and inactive stabilized dopants. The resultant Fe/Ti cosubstituted Na0.95Ni0.40Fe0.15Mn0.3Ti0.15O2 undergoes highly reversible O3-P3-OP2 phase transitions with a small cell volume change of 2.8%, instead of complex O3-O'3-P3-P'3-P3'-O1 phase transitions in NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2. Consequently, the cathode displays a high specific capacity of 161.6 mAh g-1 with an average working voltage of 3.28 V and 81.8% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 5C. Furthermore, the cathode material remains very stable after exposure to air for 7 days and even after soaking in water for 1 h, owing to the prohibition of sodium losing by elevating redox potential and contracting sodium layer spacing.

Here, a quantitative analysis of Zn2+ and H+ transport in a disordered sodium vanadate (NaV3O8) cathode material has been reported. Collectively, synchrotron X-ray analysis shows that both Zn2+ and H+ storages follow an intercalation storage mechanism in NaV3O8 and proceed in a sequential manner, where intercalations of 0.26 Zn2+ followed by 0.24 H+ per vanadium atom occur during discharging, while reverse dynamics happens during charging. Such a unique and synergistic dual-ion sequential storage favors a high capacity (265 mA h g-1) and an energy density (221 W h kg-1) based on the NaV3O8 cathode and a great cycling life (a capacity retention of 78% after 2000 cycles) in Zn/NaV3O8 full cells.",

Currently the discharge capacity of commercial HT-Na-S battery achieves only one third of its theoretical capacity due to polysulfides formation, understanding of which is limited due to technical difficulty in direct imaging polysulfides. Herein, in situ transmission electron microscopy implemented with a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) heating device is used to investigate the electrochemical reactions of HT-Na-S batteries. The formation and evolution of transient polysulfides during cycling are revealed in real-time. Upon discharge, sulfur transforms to long-chain polysulfides, short-chain polysulfides, and finally Na2 S or its mixture with polysulfides, and the process is reversible during charge at high temperatures. Surprisingly, by introducing nanovoids into the sulfur cathode to buffer the large volume change thus preserving the integrity of the electronic/ionic pathways and reducing the diffusion distance of Na+ ions, the sulfur cathode is fully discharged to Na2 S rather than the conventionally observed Na2 S2 at 300 °C. Moreover, the electrochemical reaction is swift and highly reversible. The in situ studies provide not only new understanding to the polysulfide electrochemistry, but also critical strategies to boost the capacity and cyclability of HT-Na-S batteries for large-scale energy storage applications.",

And the electron transfer between V3+/4+ redox couple in NVP could be generally achieved, owing to the confined crystal variation during battery service. However, the more favorable V4+/5+ redox couple is still in hard‐to‐access situation due to the high barrier and further brings about the corresponding inefficiency in energy densities. In this work, the multilevel redox in NVP frame (MLNP) alters reaction pathway to undergo homeostatic solid solution process and breaks the high barrier of V4+/5+ at high voltage, taking by progressive transition metal (V, Fe, Ti, and Cr) redox couple. The diversified reaction paths across diffusion barriers could be realized by distinctive release/uptake of inactive Na1 site, confirmed by the calculations of density functional theory. Thereby its volume change is merely 1.73% during the multielectron‐transfer process (≈2.77 electrons). MLNP cathode could achieve an impressive energy density of 440 Wh kg−1, driving the leading development of MLNP among other NASICON structure SIBs.

Notably, Cu‐TBA with a rhombus topology exhibits a high specific surface area (613 m2 g−1) and metallic band structure. Additionally, Cu‐TBA outperforms its hexagonal counterpart, Cu‐HHTP (HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11‐hexahydroxyltriphenylene), demonstrating superior reversible capacity (153.6 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1) and outstanding cyclability with minimal capacity decay even after 3000 cycles at 1 A g−1. This work elucidates a new strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of 2D c‐MOFs cathode materials by narrowing the energy gap of organic linkers, effectively expanding the utilization of 2D c‐MOFs for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Aqueous Zn-ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries in stationary storage. However, limited storage capacity and cyclic life impede their large-scale implementation. We report reversible electrochemical insertion of multi-ions into sodium vanadate (NaV3O8) cathode materials for AZIBs, achieving a maximum storage capacity of 450 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 and a capacity retention of 82% after 500 cycles at 0.4 A g-1. In addition to Zn2+ and H+ insertion, in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) collectively provide explicit evidence on vanadyl ions (VO2+) conversion-intercalation at the NaV3O8 cathode, showing the deintercalation of VO2+ from NaV3O8 and the consequent conversion of VO2+ into V2O5 on charging, and vice versa on discharging. Our study is the first to report on the cation conversion-intercalation mechanism in AZIBs. This reversible multi-ion storage mechanism provides a design principle for developing high-capacity aqueous electrode materials by engaging both the intercalation and conversion of charge carriers.",

Recently, a new strategy to design flexible, binder-, and additive-free three-dimensional electrodes with nanoscale surface engineering has been exploited in boosting the storage performance of electrode materials. In this paper, we design a new type of free-standing carbon quantum dot coated VO2 interwoven nanowires through a simple fabrication process and demonstrate its potential to be used as cathode material for lithium and sodium ion batteries. The versatile carbon quantum dots that are vastly flexible for surface engineering serve the function of protecting the nanowire surface and play an important role in the diffusion of electrons. Also, the three-dimensional carbon cloth coated with VO2 interwoven nanowires assisted in the diffusion of ions through the inner and the outer surface. With this unique architecture, the carbon quantum dot nanosurface engineered VO2 electrode exhibited capacities of 420 and 328 mAh g(-1) at current density rate of 0.3 C for lithium and sodium storage, respectively.

The carbon additives affect only the morphology and textural properties of the composites. The performance of composites in sodium and lithium cells is evaluated at elevated temperatures.

In sodium half-cells, NFPP/rGO delivers a reversible capacity of 95 mAh/g at 20 °C and 115 mAh/g at 40 °C with a cycling stability of 95% and 88% at a rate of C/2. In lithium half-cells, the capacity reaches a value of 120 mAh/g at 20 and 40 °C, but the cycling stability becomes worse, especially at 40 °C.

        "abstract": "Although there are many cathode candidates for sodium-ion batteries (NIBs), NaCrO2 remains one of the most attractive materials due to its reasonable level of capacity, nearly flat reversible voltages, and high thermal stability. However, the cyclic stability of NaCrO2 needs to be further improved in order to compete with other state-of-the-art NIB cathodes. In this study, we show that Cr2O3-coated and Al-doped NaCrO2, which is synthesized through a simple one-pot synthesis, can achieve unprecedented cyclic stability. We confirm the preferential formation of a Cr2O3 shell and a Na(Cr1-2xAl2x)O2 core, rather than xAl2O3/NaCrO2 or Na1/1+2x(Cr1/1+2xAl2x/1+2x)O2, through spectroscopic and microscopic methods. The core/shell compounds exhibit superior electrochemical properties compared to either Cr2O3-coated NaCrO2 without Al dopants or Al-doped NaCrO2 without shells because of their synergistic contributions. As a result, Na(Cr0.98Al0.02)O2 with a thin Cr2O3 layer (5 nm) shows no capacity fading during 1000 charge/discharge cycles while maintaining the rate capability of pristine NaCrO2. In addition, the compound is inert against humid air and water. We also discuss the reasons for the excellent performance of Cr2O3-coated Na(Cr1-2xAl2x)O2.",

        "title": "Cu/F Dual-Doping on the Ni–Mn Based Layered Oxide As Cathode Material for Sodium-Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "As demands for energy storage are ever-increasing, sodium ion batteries (SIB) have been widely conducted for superior electrochemical performance and reduction in cost compared to lithium ion batteries (LIBs), one of the most commonly used energy storage devices nowadays. Among all the parts in batteries, cathode materials play a crucial role with regard to performance. Here, layered transition metal oxides (LTMOs) (NaxTMO2, TM = Cu, Mn, Fe, Ti, Co, Cr, Ni, etc.) have kept catching researchers’ eyes due to their mature developments in commercial LIBs over decades.\n P2-type Ni/Mn-based LTMOs (such as Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2, NNMO) exhibit high theoretical specific capacity (~173 mAh g−\n 1) with environmentally friendly and cheap elements. However, they show limited stability upon charging over 4.2 V, directly restricting their energy density and lowering operating voltage. Besides, disadvantages such as poor rate performance and air/moisture sensitivity are remaining improvements for commercialization. Hence, our study mainly focuses on improvements for shortages of NNMO by applying a facile cation-and-anion co-doping strategy. Via transition metal Cu ion doping, the cycling stability of NNMO can be improved without sacrificing too much capacity, and the air stability can also be improved. In addition, F doping to replace oxygen can further enhance the structural stability and increase the rate performance by modifying interlayer spacing of the layered structure. A facile sol-gel method with heat treatment is used to synthesize cation-and-anion co-doped NNMO. The material characterization shows successful synthesis after cation and anion doping. In addition, the long cycle test shows that capacity retention increases from ~50% to ~90% over 100 cycles after Cu doping. The specific discharge capacity also increases from ~110 mAh/g to ~130 mAh/g at 0.1C with a slight increase in cycle retention from ~75% to ~77% after F doping. Also, the capacity at 20C could be maintained at ~50 mAh/g, around 45% of the initial capacity at 0.1C. The detailed charge storage mechanism will be studied by applying operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. As for the moisture sensitivity part, the XRD spectra indicate that no noticeable structural changes or impurity formation occurred after air exposure for one month, showing good air stability. Furthermore, operando XRD is conducted to confirm structural reversibility during charging and discharging.\n In summary, by applying a simple Cu/F co-doping strategy, Na0.67Ni0.13Cu0.20Mn0.67O2-xFx exhibits sufficient cycle stability for over 100 cycles as well as excellent rate capability even at a high current density of 20C, which proves itself a promising candidate as high-performance cathode material in SIBs. In addition, the cheap and environmentally friendly elemental usage (Ni, Mn and Cu) and air-stability enhancement also increase possibility of this material for large-scale energy storage application in industry.",

        "abstract": "Manganese dioxide with high theoretical capacity has drawn a great deal of attention for aqueous zinc‐ion batteries (ZIBs). Nevertheless, their sluggish diffusion kinetics, low electrical conductivity and limited active sites are still hindering the potential application in batteries. Herein, amorphous MnO2 nanosheets with abundant oxygen vacancies are facilely prepared by using carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC) as a capping agent. During the growth process, CMC can preferentially attach to the (003) facet of MnO2 to guide its crystal growth and morphology. The small nanosheets can expose abundant edge sites, along with the surface oxygen vacancies, to facilitate the insertion/extraction of H+ and Zn2+ in ZIBs. Moreover, the presence of CMC can stabilize the Mn3+ to inhibit the Jahn–Teller effect in the preparation process. As a result, CMC‐MnO2 based ZIB can provide a specific capacity of 324 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, and achieve 86.2% retention after a long cycle test of 1000 cycles. Furthermore, the energy storage mechanism may be attributed to the insertion/extraction of H+/Zn2+, dissolution/deposition of MnO2 and Zn4SO4(OH)6·nH2O, and irreversible transformation of vermiculite during long cycles. This work may open new perspectives for the development of MnO2‐based cathodes in ZIBs.",

Herein, one new P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn5/9Al1/9O2 (NMA) cathode material is successfully prepared via a simple and facile liquid-state method. The prepared NMA is layered transition metal oxide, which can keep stable crystal structure during sodiation/desodiation as demonstrated by the ex situ X-ray diffraction, and its electrochemical properties can be further enhanced by connecting the cake-like NMA microparticles with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) using a ball milling method.

The much improved properties should be attributed to the reduced particle size and improvement of electrical conductivity and apparent Na(+) diffusion due to RGO incorporation, which is comprehensively verified by the electrochemical technologies of galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry at various scan rate as well as ex-situ X-ray diffraction studies.",

Herein, a kind of NASICON-type Na2.5V1.5Ti0.5(PO4)3/C (NVTP-0.5) hierarchical microsphere consisting of abundant primary nanoparticles is designed, realizing a reversible 3.2-electron reaction with high stability. The optimized NVTP-0.5 cathode demonstrates an ultrahigh discharge capacity of 192.42 mAh g-1, energy density of up to 497.3 Wh kg-1 at 20 mA g-1, and capacity retention ratio of 94.1% after 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1. Additionally, the NVTP-0.5 cathode delivers excellent tolerance to extreme temperatures while also achieving a high-energy density of 400 Wh kg-1 (based on the cathode mass) in a full-cell configuration. Systematic in situ/ex situ analysis results confirm the multisodium storage processes of NVTP-0.5 involving successive redox reactions (V2+/V3+, Ti3+/Ti4+, and V3+/V4+ redox couples) and reversible structure evolution (solid-solution and biphasic mechanisms), which contribute to the high capacity and excellent cycling stability.

        "abstract": "Low-temperature synthesis of polyanionic cathodes for sodium-ion batteries is highly desirable but often plagued by prolonged reaction times and suboptimal crystallinity. To address these challenges, a novel self-adaptive coordination field regulation (SACFR) strategy based on a dynamic lock-and-release (DLR) mechanism is introduced. Specifically, urea is used as a DLR carrier during synthesis, which dynamically \"locks\" and \"releases\" vanadium ions for controlled release, simultaneously \"locking\" H+ ions to enhance phosphate group release, thereby creating a self-adaptive coordination field that can intelligently respond to real-time demands of the reaction system. This dynamic coordination behavior contributes to both an improvement in reaction kinetics and a significant reduction in Gibbs free energy change (ΔG). As a result, the kinetic efficiency and thermodynamic spontaneity of the reaction are greatly enhanced, enabling the efficient synthesis of high-crystalline Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) at 90 °C within just 3 hours. The as-prepared NVOPF cathode exhibits exceptional rate performance and ultra-stable cycling stability across a broad temperature range. Furthermore, the successful kilogram-scale synthesis underscores the practical potential of the innovative strategy.

        "abstract": "Abstract Using first‐principles calculations, biaxial tensile (ϵ=2 and 4 %) and compressive (ϵ=−2 and −4 %) straining of Na2MnSiO4 lattices resulted into radial distance cut offs of 1.65 and 2 Å, respectively, in the first and second nearest neighbors shell from the center. The Si−O and Mn−O bonds with prominent probability density peaks validated structural stability. Wide‐band gap of 2.35 (ϵ=0 %) and 2.54 eV (ϵ=−4 %), and narrow bandgap of 2.24 eV (ϵ=+4 %) estimated with stronger coupling of p–d σ bond than that of the p–d π bond, mainly contributed from the oxygen p‐state and manganese d‐state. Na+‐ion diffusivity was found to be enhanced by three orders of magnitude as the applied biaxial strain changed from compressive to tensile. According to the findings, the rational design of biaxial strain would improve the ionic and electronic conductivity of Na2MnSiO4 cathode materials for advanced rechargeable sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Adapting solid‐state Li‐metal batteries is an attractive way to pursue higher energy density and safety compared to liquid‐based ones. With high ionic conductivity and excellent stability with Li, Ta‐doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZTO) is an effective option. However, the poor solid–solid interface contact induced by the lithiophobic Li2CO3 layer hinder its practical application. Herein, a versatile strategy is proposed based on the hydrolysis of sodium tetrafluoroborate (NaBF4), aiming to convert the Li2CO3 into multifunctional hybrid layer containing LiF, LiBO2, and NaF. Among them, LiF and LiBO2 serve as the primary Li ion conductors, the introduction of NaF with high surface energy not only enhances the interface wettability, but also further elevates the critical dendrite strength against Li dendrites. All three components serve as excellent electronic insulators, suppressing electron invasion at the interface and preventing Li dendrite growth in the solid electrolyte. As expected, the interfacial impedance of the NaBF4 treated symmetric cell is reduced to 6.0 Ω cm2, the critical current density (CCD) comes to 2.0 mA cm−2, and cycles over 3000 h at 0.3 mA cm−2 and 1500 h at 0.5 mA cm−2 respectively.

        "abstract": "Increasing generation of permanent magnet waste has resulted in an urgent need to preserve finite resources. Reforming these wastes as feedstock to produce renewables is an ideal strategy for addressing waste and energy challenges. Herein, our work reports a smart and sustainable strategy to convert iron in magnet wastes into Prussian blue analogues that can serve as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Moreover, a method to control feed rates is proposed to generate high-quality materials with fewer [Fe(CN)6] vacancies at a feed rate of 3 mL min-1. The recycled Na1.46Fe[Fe(CN)6]0.85·□0.15 shows low vacancies and excellent cycling stability over 300 cycles (89% capacity retention at 50 mA g-1). In operando, evidence indicates that high-quality Prussian blue allows fast sodium-ion mobility and a high degree of reversibility over the course of cycling, although with a three-phase-transition mechanism.

The titanium dioxide coating inhibits the shuttle effect via the chemisorption of intermediates and catalyzes the conversion of polyselenides. Furthermore, the longan shell-derived porous carbon promotes the transfer of electrons and buffers the volume change during cycling. As a result, the well-designed cathode displays a high capacity of 637.8 mAh g−1, excellent cyclic stability, and outstanding rate performance (158.8 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1).

        "abstract": "The P2‐type layered transition metal oxide cathodes confront formidable challenges, including irreversible deleterious phase transitions, transition metals migration, and sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics, which hamper their rapid commercial application in sodium ion batteries (SIB). In this work, an entropy tuning with dual‐site substitution strategy is proposed to address the aforementioned issues. In the tailored [Na0.67Zn0.05]Ni0.22Cu0.06Mn0.66Ti0.01O2 (NZNCMTO) cathodes, the strategic incorporation of Zn ions serves to occupy Na sites, intentionally disrupting the Na/vacancy ordering and establishing a reinforcing “pillar” effect within the layered framework. Furthermore, the substitution of Cu and Ti for Ni and Mn bolsters covalent bonding with the lattice oxygen, thereby impeding the migration of the transition metal ions and leading to a near‐zero strain structural evolution during charge and discharge process. Density functional theory calculations confirmed that entropy‐tuned NZNCMTO substantially lowered the migration energy barrier for Na+ ions diffusion and improved electronic conductivity. Consequently, the NZNCMTO cathode exhibits an impressive high practical capacity of 91.54 mAh g−1 at a high discharge rate of 10 C, along with outstanding cycling stability, maintaining near 100% capacity retention over 500 cycles at a current density of 10 C.

Herein, B substituted Na3V2P3–xBxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) as stable cathode materials for Na‐ion battery is presented. A combined experimental and theoretical investigations on Na3V2P3–xBxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) are undertaken to reveal the evolution of crystal and electronic structures and Na storage properties associated with various concentration of B. X‐ray diffraction results indicate that the crystal structure of Na3V2P3–xBxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1/3) consisted of rhombohedral Na3V2(PO4)3 with tiny shrinkage of crystal lattice. X‐ray absorption spectra and the calculated crystal structures all suggest that the detailed local structural distortion of substituted materials originates from the slight reduction of V–O distances. Na3V2P3‐1/6B1/6O12 significantly enhances the structural stability and electrochemical performance, giving remarkable enhanced capacity of 100 and 70 mAh g−1 when the C‐rate increases to 5 C and 10 C. Spin‐polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that, as compared with the pristine Na3V2(PO4)3, the superior electrochemical performance of the substituted materials can be attributed to the emergence of new boundary states near the band gap, lower Na+ diffusion energy barriers, and higher structure stability.",

The existence of the low conductivity NiCl2 layer and the growth of the Ni and the NaCl particles limit the broader application of Na-NiCl2 battery. Herein, nickel-carbon nanofiber composite networks (NCCNs) are synthesized by a multisolution electrospinning method to construct a novel three-dimensional cathode for Na-NiCl2 battery. The battery with the NCCNs-based cathode shows significant improvement on rate and cycle performance at 190 oC. A capacity twice than that of a conventional electrode after 100 cycles and 80% of the initial capacity after 400 cycles are observed at a current of 57 mA g-1. The NCCNs-based cathode even normally works more than 350 cycles without obvious degradation at a high current of 338 mA g-1, that is, a rate of 2C. Furthermore, in-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals faster electron and ion transport process precisely on the charging and discharging processes of the NCCNs-based cathode. It is found that the NCCNs can not only play the role of a continuous conductivity network, but also limit the growth of grains.

Synchrotron operando X‐ray diffraction demonstrates that Te substitution can suppress the O3−P3−O1‐phase transition during charge and discharge processes effectively, benefited from the strong TeO covalent bonds. The resulted Na2.2Ni2Sb0.2Te0.8O6 cathode exhibits a high capacity retention of 70.9% after 1000 cycles at 1C, with an elevated operating voltage of ≈3.8 V.

Here, it is demonstrated that through electron spin polarization, at no additional energy cost, an external magnetic field (M on) generated by a permanent magnet can significantly improve the SPSs adsorption capacity and reaction dynamics of a ferrimagnetic sulfur host. More specifically, the preparation of a carbon nanofiber/CoFe2O4/S (CNF/CoFe2O4/S) cathode with unprecedented performance and stability at ambient temperature is detailed when M on. It is experimentally and theoretically demonstrated that the magnetic field polarizes the electrons of Co ions, enhancing the adsorption of SPSs and their catalytic conversion. CNF/CoFe2O4/S cathodes with spin polarization provide unprecedented decay rates down to 0.0039% per cycle at 1.0 C for 2700 cycles. The performance of SSBs is further tested, which has 248 mAh g−1 under 1.0 C after 100 cycles when M on. Furthermore, it is evidenced that even when removing the external magnetic field, the magnetic polarization effect persists, opening the door for practical applications.

In this work, we systematically studied the theoretical capacity and sodium ion diffusion barrier in a new family of layered transition metal compounds, named MX2 (M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, and Fe; X = C, N, and O), as the cathode materials of SIBs. The results indicate that all 2H-phase MX2 materials possess a high theoretical capacity of over 300 mA h g−1. Moreover, it is found that the 2H-phase CrN2 exhibits a desirable sodium ion diffusion barrier, indicating high mobility of sodium ions. In addition, the layered CrN2 has a remarkable voltage window (3.1–3.8 V) and outstanding electrochemical performance arising from the charge transfer between Na and N atoms, which is induced by the large electronegativity of nitrogen. Our research provides a promising candidate for application in SIB cathode materials in the future.",

        "abstract": "As for sodium-ion battery cathodes, the structure evolution during cycling plays a vital role in their electrochemical performance. Herein, through a strategy for engineering the crystal structure coupled with chemical element substitution, we design a layered P2@P3 integrated spinel Na 0.5 Ni 0.1 Co 0.15 Mn 0.65 Mg 0.1 O 2 oxide cathode. This novel electrode shows excellent sodium-ion half/full battery performance due to the synergistic effects of its triphase intergrowth structure and cation substitution strategy. Based on combined analyses by scanning transmission electron microscopy with atomic resolution, as well as ex-situ synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectra and in-situ synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction patterns, the inherent layered P2@P3 integrated spinel structure, charge compensation mechanism, structural evolution, and phase transition are clearly articulated and confirmed. This study provides an in-depth understanding of the structure-performance relationship in this special structure and opens up a novel field via manipulating structural evolution for the design of high-performance battery cathodes.",

        "abstract": "Solid‐state sodium‐ion/metal batteries (SSSBs) are highly desirable for next‐generation energy storage systems, while very limited Na‐ion solid‐state electrolytes are explored. The borohydride‐based solid electrolytes are expected to achieve the high energy density target, due to their low redox potential, low Young's modulus as well as high stability toward alkali metals. However, the biggest challenge of borohydride‐based electrolyte is the low ionic conductivity. In this study, an anti‐perovskite solid‐state electrolyte (SSE) material rich in vacancy defects is explored, Na2BH4NH2, to solve above problems. Benefitting from rich vacancy defects, a high ionic conductivity of 7.56 × 10−4 S cm−1 with a low activation energy for Na+ migration of 0.67 eV at 90 °C are achieved. The NaSn|Na2BH4NH2|NaSn symmetric cell cycles at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2 for 500 h. Moreover, the universality of Na2BH4NH2 electrolyte is verified by TiS2 cathode, indicating that Na2BH4NH2 has good compatibility with electrode material. These outstanding performances suggest that it is a viable strategy to increase the ionic conductivity by forming vacancy defects, leading to the further development of solid electrolytes with superior properties.",

        "abstract": "Sodium all-solid-state batteries may become a novel storage technology overcoming the safety and energy density issues of (liquid-based) sodium ion batteries at low cost and good resource availability. However, compared to liquid electrolyte cells, contact issues and capacity losses due to interface reactions leading to high cell resistance are still a problem in solid-state batteries. In particular, sulfide-based electrolytes, which show very high ionic conductivity and good malleability, exhibit degradation reactions at the interface with electrode materials and carbon additives. A new group of solid electrolytes, i.e., sodium halides, shows wider potential windows and better stability at typical cathode potentials. A detailed investigation of the interface reactions of Na3SbS4 and Na2.4Er0.4Zr0.6Cl6 as catholytes in cathodes and their cycling performance in full cells is performed. X-ray spectroscopy, time-of-flight spectrometry, and impedance spectroscopy are used to study the interface of each catholyte with a transition metal oxide cathode active material. In addition, impedance measurements were used to study the separator electrolyte Na3SbS4 with the catholyte Na2.4Er0.4Zr0.6Cl6. In conclusion, cathodes with Na2.4Er0.4Zr0.6Cl6 show a higher stability at low C-rates, resulting in lower interfacial resistance and improved cycling performance.",

        "abstract": "Sodium vanadate NaV6O15 (NVO) is one of the most promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries because of its low cost and high theoretical capacity. Nevertheless, NVO suffers from fast capacity fading and poor rate capability. Herein, a novel free-standing NVO/multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composite film cathode was synthesized and designed by a simple hydrothermal method followed by a dispersion technique with high safety and low cost. The kinetics analysis based on cyclic voltammetry measurements reveals that the intimate integration of the MWCNT 3D porous conductive network with the 3D pillaring tunnel structure of NVO nanorods enhances the Na+ intercalation pseudocapacitive behavior, thus leading to exceptional rate capability and long lifespan. Furthermore, the NVO/MWCNT composite exhibits excellent structural stability during the charge/discharge process. With these benefits, the composite delivers a high discharge capacity of 217.2 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 in a potential region of 1.5-4.0 V. It demonstrates a superior rate capability of 123.7 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1. More encouragingly, it displays long lifespan; impressively, 96% of the initial capacity is retained at 5 A g-1 for over 500 cycles.

        "abstract": "Abstract Layered oxides of sodium‐ion batteries suffer from severe side reactions on the electrode/electrolyte interface, leading to fast capacity degradation. Although surface reconstruction strategies are widely used to solve the above issues, the utilization of the low‐cost wet chemical method is extremely challenging for moisture‐sensitive Na‐based oxide materials. Here, the solvation tuning strategy is proposed to overcome the deterioration of NaNi1/3Mn1/3Fe1/3O2 in water‐based solution and conduct the surface reconstruction. When capturing the water molecules by the solvation structure of cations, here is Li+, the structural collapse and degradation of layered oxides in water‐based solvents are greatly mitigated. Furthermore, Li(H2O)3EA+ promotes the profitable Li+/Na+ exchange to build a robust surface, which hampers the decomposition of electrolytes and the structural evolution upon cycling. Accordingly, the lifespan of Li‐reinforced materials is prolonged to three times that of the pristine one. This work represents a step forward in understanding the surface reconstruction operated in a water‐based solution for high‐performance sodium layered oxide cathodes.",

However, concerns remain over its long-term electrochemical performance and structural factors which impact sources of resistance in the material and subsequently rate performance. Refined control of the [Fe(CN)6] vacancies and water content could help in realizing its market potential. In this context, we have studied a low-defect Berlin green (BG) Na0.30(5)Fe[Fe(CN)6]0.94(2)·nH2O with varied water content corresponding to 10, 8, 6, and 2 wt%. The impact of water on the electrochemical properties of BG was systematically investigated. The electrodes were cycled within a narrow voltage window of 3.15-3.8 V vs. Na/Na+ to avoid undesired phase transitions and side reactions while preserving the cubic structure. We demonstrate that thermal dehydration leads to a significantly improved cycling stability of over 300 cycles at 15 mA g-1 with coulombic efficiency of >99.9%. In particular, the electrode with the lowest water content exhibited the fastest Na+-ion insertion/extraction as evidenced by the larger CV peak currents during successive scans compared to hydrated samples.

Herein, copper dissolution is successfully suppressed by forming Cu2+‐coordinated sodium alginate (Cu‐SA) on the surface of CuF2 particles during the electrode fabrication process, by using water as a slurry solvent and sodium alginate (SA) as a binder. The trace dissolved Cu2+ in water from CuF2 can in situ cross‐link with SA binder forming a conformal Cu‐SA layer on CuF2 surface. After water evaporation during the electrode dry process, the Cu‐SA layer is Li‐ion conductor but Cu2+ insulator, which can effectively suppress the dissolution of Cu‐ions in the organic 4 m LiClO4/ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate electrolyte, enhancing the reversibility of CuF2.

For the expected sodium vanadium bronzes (NaxV2O5) precipitation, the preparation of xNV was performed by keeping the system in the molten state at 1200 °C for one hour, followed by a temperature decrease in the electric furnace to room temperature at a cooling rate of 10 °C min−1. XRD patterns of the 15NV ceramic exhibited the formation of Na0.33V2O5 and NaV3O8 crystalline phases. Moreover, the V K-edge XANES showed that the absorption edge energy of ceramics 15NV recorded at 5479 eV is smaller than that of V2O5 at 5481 eV, evidently indicating a partial reduction from V5+ to V4+ due to the precipitation of Na0.33V2O5. In the cyclic voltammetry, reduction peaks of 15NV were observed at 1.12, 1.78 V, and 2.69 V, while the oxidation peak showed up only at 2.36 V. The values of the reduction peaks were related to the NaV3O8 crystalline phase. Moreover, the diffusion coefficient of Na+ (DNa+) gradually decreased from 8.28 × 10−11 cm2 s−1 to 1.23 × 10−12 cm2 s−1 with increasing Na2O content (x) from 5 to 45 mol%. In the evaluation of the active cathode performance of xNV in SIB, ceramics 15NV showed the highest discharge capacity 203 mAh g−1 at a current rate of 50 mA g−1. In the wider voltage range from 0.8 to 3.6 V, the capacity retention was maintained at 50% after 30 cycles, while it was significantly improved to 90% in the narrower voltage range from 1.8 to 4.0 V, although the initial capacity decreased to 56 mAh g−1. It is concluded that the precipitation of the Na0.33V2O5 phase improved the structural and electrical properties of 15NV, which provides a high capacity for the Na-ion battery when incorporated as a cathode active material.",

However, the poor structural stability is a major drawback to their widespread application. To address this issue, B3+ is successfully introduced into the tetrahedral site of Na0.67 Fe0.5 Mn0.5 O2 , demonstrating the effectiveness of small-radius ion doping in improving electrochemical performance. The obtained Na0.67 Fe0.5 Mn0.5 B0.04 O2 exhibits excellent cycling performance with 88.8% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1 C and prominent rate performance. The structure-property relationship is constructed subsequently by neutron powder diffraction, in situ X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, which reveal that the Jahn-Teller distortion and the consequent P2-P2' phase transformation are effectively mitigated because of the occupancy of B3+ at the interstitial site. Furthermore, it is found that the transition metal layers are stabilized and the transition metal dissolution are suppressed, resulting in excellent cycling performance. Besides, the prominent rate performance is attributed to the enhanced diffusion kinetics associated with the rearrangement of Na+ . This work provides novel insight into the action mechanism of interstitial site doping and demonstrates a universal approach to improve the electrochemical properties of P2-type manganese-based sodium cathode materials.",

Among them, NiQAP as the cathode material exhibits impressive electrochemical properties applied in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), including the high initial/stable discharge specific capacities (180.0/225.6 mAh g-1 ) at 0.05 A g-1 , a long-term cycle stability up to 10,000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1 with a high reversible capacity of 100.1 mAh g-1 , and good rate capability of 99.6 mAh g-1 even at 5.0 A g-1 . Moreover, the Na-ion storage mechanism of NiQAP is also performed by the density functional theory (DFT) calculation, showing multiple-active sites of C≐O and C≐N (in the quinone and phenazine structure) and NiO4 (in the coordination unit) for Na-ion storage. These results highlight the importance of organic electrode material with the coordination units and provide a foundation for further studying the CCPs with multiple active sites for energy storage systems.",

        "abstract": "Manganese-based layered oxides are considered promising cathodes for sodium ion batteries due to their high capacity and low-cost manganese and sodium resources. Triggering the anionic redox reaction (ARR) can exceed the capacity limitation determined by conventional cationic redox. However, the unstable ARR charge compensation and Jahn-Teller distortion of Mn3+ ions readily result in structural degradation and rapid capacity fade. Here, we report a P2-type Na0.8Li0.2Mn0.7Cu0.1O2 cathode that shows a capacity retention of 84.5% at 200 mA/g after 200 cycles. Combining in situ X-ray diffraction and multi other ex situ characterizations, we reveal that the enhanced cycling stability is ascribed to a slow release of cationic redox activity which can well suppress the Jahn-Teller distortion and favor the ARR reversibility. Furthermore, density-functional theory calculations demonstrate that the inhibited interlayer migration and reduced band gap facilitate the stability and kinetic behavior of ARR. These findings provide a perspective for designing high-energy-density cathode materials with ARR activity.",

However, high water and vacancies content of PBAs lower their energy density and bring safety issues, impeding their large-scale application in SIBs. Herein, a facile \"potassium-ions assisted\" strategy is proposed to synthesize highly crystallized PBAs. By manipulating the dominant crystal plane and suppressing vacancies, the as-prepared PBAs exhibits increased redox potential resulting in high energy density up to ~450 Wh kg-1, which is at the same level of the well-known LiFePO4 cathodes for lithium-ion batteries. Remarkably, unconventional highly-reversible phase evolution and redox-active pairs were identified by multiple in-situ techniques for the first time. The preferred guest-ion storage sites and migration mechanism were systematically analysed through theoretical calculations.

Additional cost cutbacks are achievable by employing natural materials as active cathode materials for NIBs. In this work, we report the use of natural pyrolusite (β-MnO2) as a precursor for the synthesis of a NaMnO blend (a mixture of layered P2-Na0.67Mn0.85Al0.15O2 without any doping technique combined with a post-spinel NaMn2O4 without any high-pressure synthesis). The synthesized powder was characterized by XRD, evidencing these two phases, along with two additional phases. Tests for Na-ion insertion registered a reversible discharge capacity of 104 mA h/g after 10 cycles with a well-defined plateau at 2.25 V. After 500 cycles at a C/4 current density, a high Coulombic efficiency between 96 and 99% was achieved, with an overall 25% capacity retention loss. These pilot tests are encouraging; they provide economic relief since the natural material is abundant (low-cost). Desirable, energetic assurances and ecological confirmations are obtainable if these materials are implemented in large-scale stationary applications. The synthesis technique does not use any toxic metals or toxic solvents and has limited side product formation.",

        "abstract": "Aqueous zinc ion battery (AZIB) has been widely investigated in recent years because of its advantages of green, safe and abundant raw materials. It is necessary to continue to study how to prepare cathode materials with excellent performance and high cycling stability toward future commercialization. In this work, we proposed a strategy that uses sodium lignosulfonate as both carbon and sodium source to obtain a sodium pre-intercalated vanadium oxide/carbon (VO/LSC) composite as the cathode of AZIB. The carbon matrix could improve the electronic conductivity of vanadium oxide, while the sodium lignosulfonate can provide sodium ions pre-intercalated into the layered vanadium oxide simultaneously. Through this strategy, we obtained a vanadium-based cathode materials with high stability and excellent rate capability. The VO/LSC cathode delivered high capacities of 350 and 112.8 mAh g -1 at 0.1 and 4.0 A g -1 resepectively. We selected zinc sulfate and zinc trifluoromethyl sulfonate as electrolytes respectively, and analyzed the influence of electrolytes on the performance of VO/LSC. What's more, we used the oxygen in the environment to oxidize the low-priced vanadium oxide to achieve a self-charging AZIB. This paper provide a valuable strategy for the design of vanadium-base cathode material for AZIB, which can broaden the research and application of AZIB.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal layered oxides (NaxTMO2), boasting a high theoretical specific capacity and affordability, have emerged as prominent cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Their potential, however, is hindered when operating at higher voltage range (4.0–4.3 V) due to irreversible phase transition, heterogeneous surface reconstruction, and side reaction. Herein, using a straightforward room‐temperature liquid‐phase reductive method, a dual conformal protective layer is in situ constructed on the surface of NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2(NFM). This layer comprises both a spinel structure and an amorphous CoxB coating, thereby achieving a layered‐spinel‐CoxB configuration. The spinel structure provides 3D Na+ transport channels and works as a pillar to anchor the intrinsic layered structure. Simultaneously, the external CoxB layer effectively mitigates O loss, transition metal ion dissolution, and undesired side reactions on the surface. Benefiting from the synergistic effects on both the material's bulk and surface, the 1wt% CoxB coated cathode displays superior stability. After 300 cycles, the capacity retention is 79.6% between 2 and 4 V, significantly outperforming pristine‐NFM's(p‐NFM) 51.4%. When charged to 4.3 V, its capacity retention stands at 70%, much higher than that of p‐NFM (51.2%). This work provides new insights into exploiting high‐voltage stable cathode through constructing a dual conformal protective layer for high energy density SIBs.",

For P3-Na0.67 Ni0.5 Mn0.5 O2 , a large trigonal superstructure with 2√3 a×2√3 a×2 c is observed, whereas for P2-Na2/3 Ni1/3 Mn2/3 O2 there is a superstructure with reduced lattice parameters. In sodium cells, P3 and P2 phases intercalate sodium reversibly at a well-expressed voltage plateau. Preservation of the P3-type structure during sodium intercalation determines improving cycling stability of the P3 phase within an extended potential range, in comparison with that for the P2 phase, for which a P2-O2 phase transformation has been found. Between 2.0 and 4.0 V, P3 and P2 phases display an excellent rate capability. In lithium cells, the P3 phase intercalates lithium, accompanied by a P3-O3 structural transformation. The in situ generated O3 phase, containing lithium and sodium simultaneously, determines the specific voltage profile of P3-Nax Ni0.5 Mn0.5 O2 . The P2 phase does not display any reversible lithium intercalation. The P3 phase demonstrates a higher capacity at lower rates in lithium cells, whereas in sodium cells P3-Nax Ni0.5 Mn0.5 O2 operates better at higher rates.

However, the practical application of this material is limited by its poor cyclic stability and insufficient rate capability. Here, a strategy to substitute the Fe3+ in NaNi0.25Fe0.5Mn0.25O2 with Al3+ is adopted to address these issues. The substitution of Fe3+ with Al3+ enhances the framework stability and phase transition reversibility of the parent NaNi0.25Fe0.5Mn0.25O2 material by forming a stronger TM-O bond, which improves the cycling stability. Moreover, partial Al3+ substitution increases the interslab distance, providing a spacious path for Na+ diffusion and resulting in fast diffusion kinetics, which lead to improved rate capability. Consequently, the target NaNi0.25Fe0.5-xAlxMn0.25O2 sample with optimal x = 0.045 exhibits a remarkable electrochemical performance in a Na-ion cell with a large reversible capacity of 131.7 mA h g-1, a stable retention of approximately 81.6% after cycling at 1C for 100 cycles, and a rate performance of 81.3 mA h g-1 at 10C.

        "abstract": "In the development of practical sodium‐ion batteries, electrochemical performance and cost efficiency of the electrode materials are vital considerations. Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have emerged as promising cathode materials due to their affordability, high theoretical capacity, and cycling stability. However, low crystallinity can negatively impact their performance. This study introduces a straightforward “chelating agent‐assisted” method for producing highly crystalline PBAs. The resulting cathode boasts excellent characteristics, including a high capacity of 150 mAh g−1, an initial Coulombic efficiency of 87.2 %, a long cycling lifespan of 1000 cycles, and superior rate performance. Furthermore, the study shows that the low structure distortion and high sodium diffusion coefficient can be attributed to the suppression of structural defects, as evidenced by in situ synchrotron powder diffraction. We believe these findings have the potential to enable the widespread use of PBAs in sodium‐ion batteries for an affordable and large‐scale energy storage system.",

The chelating-agent-assisted co-precipitate method is an effective way to obtain low-defect PBAs that can limit the appearance of too many vacancies and water molecules and achieve an optimized Na-storage performance. However, for this method, the mechanism of chelating-agent-assisted synthesis is still unclear. Herein, the synthesis process of nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) has been investigated by in-situ infrared spectroscopy detection, with the results showing that the chelating agent oxalate makes the nucleation process slows down and effectively inhibits the formation of the Fe-C≡N-Ni frame in the aging process, producing highly-crystallized and low-defect NiHCF samples. The high-quality NiHCF presents high specific capacity as 86.3 mAh g-1 (the theoretical value ~85 mAh g-1), an ultra-stable cyclic retention of 90% over 800 cycles, and a remarkable high capacity retention as 74.6% at a current density of 4250 mA g-1 (50 C).

In this investigation we report on the influence of morphology on cycle performance for the layered NaxMnO2+z. Hollow spheres of NaxMnO2+z with a diameter of ∼5 μm were compared to flake-like NaxMnO2+z. It was found that the electrochemical behavior of both materials as measured by cyclic voltammetry is comparable. However, the cycle stability of the spheres is significantly higher, with 94 mA h g(-1) discharge capacity after 100 cycles, as opposed to 73 mA h g(-1) for the flakes (50 mA g(-1)). The better stability can potentially be attributed to better accommodation of volume changes of the material due to its spherical morphology, better contact with the added conductive carbon, and higher electrode/electrolyte interface owing to better wetting of the active material with the electrolyte.",

        "abstract": "Enhancing the energy density of layered oxide cathode materials is of great significance for realizing high-performance sodium-ion batteries and promoting their commercial application. Lattice oxygen redox at high voltage usually enables a high capacity and energy density. But the structural degradation, severe voltage decay, and the resultant poor cycling performance caused by irreversible oxygen release seriously restrict the practical application. Herein we introduce a novel fence-type superstructure (2a × 3a type supercell) into O3-type layered cathode material Na0.9Li0.1Ni0.3Mn0.3Ti0.3O2 and achieve a stable cycling performance at a high voltage of 4.4 V. The fence-type superstructure effectively inhibits the formation of the vacancy clusters resulting from out-of-plane Li migration and in-plane transition metal migration at high voltage due to the wide d-spacing, thereby significantly reducing the irreversible release of lattice oxygen and greatly stabilizing the crystal structure. The cathode exhibits a high energy density of 545 Wh kg-1, a high rate capability (112.8 mAh g-1 at 5C) and a high cycling stability (85.8%@200 cycles with a high initial capacity of 148.6 mAh g-1 at 1C) accompanied by negligible voltage attenuation (98.5%@200 cycles).

Due to the wide usage of LICs, LICs with promising energy density are urgently needed; however, at this stage, the achievement of this type of LICs is the main challenge. In this study, we increased the energy density of LICs via both material optimization and charge storage mechanism exploration. Moreover, porous carbon with a high surface area of over 2800 m2 g-1 was fabricated from alkali lignin via a traditional KOH activation method assisted by self-activation. A wide voltage window of 1.0-4.8 V was applied where the synergistic storage of anions and cations was achieved. This shows that a deep discharge down to 1.0 V is necessary for the complete desorption of anions, which also triggers the adsorption of cations (Li+), resulting in increased capacity. However, a compromise must be made in the energy efficiency due to intensified battery polarization upon deep discharging.

        "abstract": "In lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), separator is used to provide a barrier between the anode and cathode and provide freedom for the transport of lithium‐ions, which serves a key function in inhibiting internal short circuit and improving the battery safety. The limited wettability of commercial polyolefin separators in electrolytes restricts its utilization in extreme environmental conditions. In our work, we choose polypropylene (PP) as the precursor and can address the issue of poor wettability through suitable modification methods. Tannic acid (TA) and diethylenetriamine (DETA) were utilized to coat PP separator via hierarchical self‐assembly approach, and the coating is further stabilized by taking advantage of the specific oxidizing properties of sodium periodate. This method scarcely increases the separator thickness or sacrifices the microporous structure of the original separator. The improved separator not only exhibits outstanding wetting capability and relatively high ion conductivity (1.24 mS cm−1), but also has the highest lithium‐ion migration number of 0.74. This indicates that when the modified separator is applied to LIBs, its electrochemical performance is significantly enhanced. The enhancement in electrochemical performance of LIBs is attributed to the strong absorption and retention ability of the coating on the separator. The reversible capacity of Li/PP‐TD2 separator/LiFePO4 battery is 144.3 mAh g−1 at 2C, which is higher than that of PP separator (117.1 mAh g−1) under the same current density. Even after 200 cycles, the PP‐TD2 separator with two‐layer assembly modification still maintains a higher coulombic efficiency of 97.55% and a discharge capacity of 96.6%. This hierarchical self‐assembly modification of PP provides an effective approach for fabricating high‐performance separator.",

Therefore, the Mg doping improves the structural stability and its cycling performance in 1.5-4.5 V. The disordering arrangement endows Na0.49Mn0.86Mg0.06□0.08O2 with a higher Na+ diffusivity and improved rate performance. Our study reveals that oxygen oxidation is highly dependent on the ordering/disordering arrangements in the cathode materials. This work provides insights into the balance of anionic and cationic redox for enhancing the structural stability and electrochemical performance in the SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries are now considered as a low‐cost alternative to lithium‐ion technologies for large‐scale energy storage applications; however, their safety is still a matter of great concern for practical applications. In this paper, a safer sodium‐ion battery is proposed by introducing a nonflammable phosphate electrolyte (trimethyl phosphate, TMP) coupled with NaNi0.35Mn0.35Fe0.3O2 cathode and Sb‐based alloy anode. The physical and electrochemical compatibilities of the TMP electrolyte are investigated by igniting, ionic conductivity, cyclic voltammetry, and charge–discharge measurements. The results exhibit that the TMP electrolyte with FEC additive is completely nonflammable and has wide electrochemical window (0–4.5 V vs. Na/Na+), in which both the Sb‐based anode and NaNi0.35Mn0.35Fe0.3O2 cathode show high reversible capacity and cycling stability, similarly as in carbonate electrolyte. Based on these results, a nonflammable sodium‐ion battery is constructed by use of Sb anode, NaNi0.35Mn0.35Fe0.3O2 cathode, and TMP + 10 vol% FEC electrolyte, which works very well with considerable capacity and cyclability, demonstrating a promising prospect to build safer sodium‐ion batteries for large‐scale energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "The key to development of high-voltage P2-type Na0.66Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 is the modification methods that can effectively improve its electrochemical reversibility. Herein, a doping-integrated coating strategy based on zinc element is proposed to modify P2-type Na0.66Ni0.33Mn0.67O2, which can be achieved by a facile one-step solid-state reaction. The formation mechanism of Na0.66Ni0.26Zn0.07Mn0.67O2@0.06ZnO (NNZM@0.06ZnO) is investigated, revealing that the spinel and P3 intermediate phases appear prior to the formation of the P2 phase. Ni2+ can be preferentially incorporated into the P2 structure in competition with Zn2+ at high temperature, resulting in a uniform enrichment of ZnO on the surface. A small amount of Zn2+ doping significantly suppresses the Na+/vacancy ordering effect and improves the structural reversibility. Furthermore, the electrolyte decomposition is effectively reduced because of the presence of the ZnO coating layer, leading to the formation of a thin cathode electrolyte interphase film that is favorable to fast Na+ diffusion. In virtue of the Zn2+ doping and in situ formed ZnO coating, NNZM@0.06ZnO exhibits excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 83.7% after 100 cycles at 100 mA g-1 and rate performance with a discharge capacity of 56.4 mAh g-1 at 2000 mA g-1, which significantly outperforms the uncoated Na0.66Ni0.26Zn0.07Mn0.67O2 and the Na0.66Ni0.26Zn0.07Mn0.67O2/0.06ZnO with the coating layer introduced by mechanical milling.

        "abstract": "Because of the large abundance of sodium (Na) as a source material and the easy fabrication of Na‐containing compounds, the sodium (Na) battery is a more environmentally friendly and sustainable technology than the lithium‐ion battery (LIB). Na‐metal batteries (SMBs) are considered promising to realize a high energy density to overtake the cost effectiveness of LIBs, which is critically important in large‐scale applications such as grid energy storage. However, the cycling stability of the Na‐metal anode faces significant challenges particularly under high cycling capacities, due to the complex failure models caused by the formation of Na dendrites. Here, a universal surface strategy, based on a self‐regulating alloy interface of the current collector, to inhibit the formation of Na dendrites is reported. High‐capacity (10 mAh cm−2) Na‐metal anodes can achieve stable cycling for over 1000 h with a low overpotential of 35 mV. When paired with a high‐capacity Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode (7 mAh cm−2), the SMB delivers an unprecedented energy density (calculated based on all the cell components) over 200 Wh kg−1 with flooded electrolyte, or over 230 Wh kg−1 with lean electrolyte. The dendrite‐free SMB also shows high cycling stability with a capacity retention per cycle over 99.9% and an ultrahigh energy efficiency of 95.8%.",

        "abstract": "P2‐type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 is a dominant cathode material for sodium‐ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity and energy density. However, charging P2‐type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 to voltages higher than 4.2 V (vs. Na+/Na) can induce detrimental structural transformation and severe capacity fading. Herein, stable cycling and moisture resistancy of Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 at 4.35 V (vs. Na+/Na) are achieved through dual‐site doping with Cu ion at transition metal site (2a) and unusual Zn ion at Na site (2d) for the first time. The Cu ion doping in 2a site stabilizes the metal layer, while more importantly, the unusual alkali‐metal site doping by Zn ion serves as O2‐Zn2+O2‐ “pillar” for enhancing electrostatic cohesion between two adjacent transition metal layers, preventing the crack of active material along the a–b‐plane and restraining the generation of O2 phase upon deep desodiation. This unique dual‐site‐doped [Na0.67Zn0.05]Ni0.18Cu0.1Mn0.67O2 cathode exhibits a prominent cyclability with 80.6% capacity retention over 2000 cycles at an ultrahigh rate of 10C, demonstrating its great potential for practical applications.

        "abstract": "The cathode material P2-Nax Co2/3 Mn2/9 Ni1/9 O2, which could be used in Na-ion batteries, was investigated through synchrotron-based hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES). Nondestructive analysis was made through the electrode/electrolyte interface of the first electrochemical cycle to ensure access to information not only on the active material, but also on the passivation layer formed at the electrode surface and referred to as the solid permeable interface (SPI). This investigation clearly shows the role of the SPI and the complexity of the redox reactions. Cobalt, nickel, and manganese are all electrochemically active upon cycling between 4.5 and 2.0 V; all are in the 4+ state at the end of charging. Reduction to Co(3+), Ni(3+), and Mn(3+) occurs upon discharging and, at low potential, there is partial reversible reduction to Co(2+) and Ni(2+). A thin layer of Na2 CO3 and NaF covers the pristine electrode and reversible dissolution/reformation of these compounds is observed during the first cycle. The salt degradation products in the SPI show a dependence on potential. Phosphates mainly form at the end of the charging cycle (4.5 V), whereas fluorophosphates are produced at the end of discharging (2.0 V).",

Rapid precipitation may lead to a large number of vacancies and a large amount of interstitial water in the material, resulting in poor electrochemical performance in batteries. Hence, sodium citrate is used to compete with [Fe(CN)6]4- to slow down the coordination rates of Ni2+ and Mn2+ ions with ferrous cyanide ions. The feasibility of the experiment is also confirmed by theoretical analysis. Benefiting from stable crystal structure and the removal of interstitial water, the as-prepared Na2NixMnyFe(CN)6 sample exhibits a high reversible capacity of 150 mA h g-1. In addition, a high rate performance of 77 mA h g-1 is achieved at a current density of 1600 mA g-1. Most noteworthy, the Coulombic efficiency and specific capacity gradually increase in the first few cycles, which can be ascribed to the formation of a passivation layer on the surface of the electrode. Continuous testing in an electrolyte solution of 1 M NaPF6 dissolved in sulfone reveals that the presence of a passivation film is very important for the stability of the electrode.",

        "abstract": "Significance Layered sodium transition metal oxides constitute an important class of materials with applications including electrochemical energy storage, high-temperature superconductivity, and electrocatalysis. However, electrodeposition of these compounds, an approach commonly used to grow oxides, has been elusive due to their atmosphere instability and intrinsic incompatibility with aqueous electrolytes. Using a molten sodium hydroxide electrolyte, we demonstrate electrodeposition of O3 (O′3)- and P2-type layered sodium transition metal oxides and apply these electrodeposits as high areal capacity cathodes in sodium-ion batteries. The electrodeposits are micrometers thick, polycrystalline, and structurally similar to materials synthesized classically at high temperature. This work enables fabrication of previously inaccessible alkali and alkaline earth ion intercalated, higher valent transition group oxides in important thick film form factors. We introduce an intermediate-temperature (350 °C) dry molten sodium hydroxide-mediated binder-free electrodeposition process to grow the previously electrochemically inaccessible air- and moisture-sensitive layered sodium transition metal oxides, NaxMO2 (M = Co, Mn, Ni, Fe), in both thin and thick film form, compounds which are conventionally synthesized in powder form by solid-state reactions at temperatures ≥700 °C. As a key motivation for this work, several of these oxides are of interest as cathode materials for emerging sodium-ion–based electrochemical energy storage systems. Despite the low synthesis temperature and short reaction times, our electrodeposited oxides retain the key structural and electrochemical performance observed in high-temperature bulk synthesized materials. We demonstrate that tens of micrometers thick >75% dense NaxCoO2 and NaxMnO2 can be deposited in under 1 h. When used as cathodes for sodium-ion batteries, these materials exhibit near theoretical gravimetric capacities, chemical diffusion coefficients of Na+ ions (∼10−12 cm2⋅s−1), and high reversible areal capacities in the range ∼0.25 to 0.76 mA⋅h⋅cm−2, values significantly higher than those reported for binder-free sodium cathodes deposited by other techniques. The method described here resolves longstanding intrinsic challenges associated with traditional aqueous solution-based electrodeposition of ceramic oxides and opens a general solution chemistry approach for electrochemical processing of hitherto unexplored air- and moisture-sensitive high valent multinary structures with extended frameworks.",

However, critical challenges, such as the formation of passivation layers during battery operation and anode-electrolyte-cathode incompatibilities, limit the practical application of Mg-metal anodes for MIBs. Motivated by the promise of group XIV elements (namely, Si, Ge, and Sn) as anodes for lithium- and sodium-ion batteries, here, we conduct systematic first-principles calculations to explore the thermodynamics and kinetics of group XIV anodes for MIBs and to identify the atomistic mechanisms of the electrochemical insertion reactions of Mg ions. We confirm the formation of amorphous Mg xX phases (where X = Si, Ge, and Sn) in anodes via the breaking of the stronger X-X bonding network replaced by weaker Mg-X bonding. Mg ions have higher diffusivities in Ge and Sn anodes than in Si, resulting from weaker Ge-Ge and Sn-Sn bonding networks. In addition, we identify thermodynamic instabilities of Mg xX that require a small overpotential to avoid aggregation (plating) of Mg at anode/electrolyte interfaces. Such comprehensive first-principles calculations demonstrate that amorphous Ge and crystalline Sn can be potentially effective anodes for practical applications in MIBs.",

Among the reported cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries, Na3V2(PO4)2FO2 is considered as one of the most promising materials due to its high operation voltage and good cyclability. Here, the de-sodiumization process of Na3V2(PO4)2FO2 has been systematically examined using first-principles calculations to uncover the fundamental questions at the atomic level. Four stable intermediate products during the de-sodiumization process are firstly determined based on the convex hull, and three voltage platforms are then predicted. Except for two voltage platforms (3.37 V and 3.75 V) close to the experimental values, the platform up to 5.28 V exceeds the stability window (4.8 V) of a typical electrolyte, which was not observed experimentally. Excitingly, the change of volume is only 2% during the sodiumization process, which should be the reason for the good cycling stability of this material. Electronic structure analysis also reveals that the valence states of V ions will be changed from V5+ to V4+ during the sodiumization process, resulting in a weak Jahn-Teller distortion in VO5F octahedra, and then making the lattice-constants asymmetrically change. More seriously, combined with a bandgap of 2.0 eV, the conduction band minimum mainly composed of V-t2g non-bonding orbitals has strong localized characteristics, which should be the intrinsic origin of poor electron transport properties for NaxV2(PO4)2FO2. Nonetheless, benefiting from the layer-like structure features with F-segmentation, this material has an ultrafast sodium ionic conductivity comparable to that of NASICON, with an activation energy of only 82 meV. Therefore, our results indicate that maintaining layer-like features and regulating V atoms will be important directions to improve the performance of NaxV2(PO4)2FO2.",

        "abstract": "The development of high-rate cathodes particularly with remarkable wide-temperature-tolerance sodium-storage capability plays a significant role in commercial applications of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we devise a scaled-up electrospinning avenue to fabricate nanocrystal-constructed ultralong layered NaCrO2 nanowires (NWs) toward SIBs as a wide-temperature-operating cathode. The resultant one-dimensional (1D) NaCrO2 nanoarchitecture is endowed with orientated and shortened electronic/ionic transport and remarkable structural tolerance to stress change over sodiation-desodiation processes. Benefiting from these structural superiorities, the NaCrO2 NWs are featured with prominent Na+-storage behaviors in the wide-operating-temperature range from -15 to 55 °C. Promisingly, the NaCrO2 NWs exhibit extraordinary high-rate capacities of ∼108.8 and ∼87.2 mAh g-1 at 10 and 50 C rates at 25 °C, and even 94.6 (55 °C) and ∼60.1 (-15 °C) mAh g-1 at 10 C, along with outstanding cyclic stabilities with capacity retentions of ∼80.6% (-15 °C), 88.4% (25 °C), and ∼86.9% (55 °C). The overall performance of our NaCrO2 is superior to other reported NaCrO2-based cathodes, even with conductive nanocarbon coating. Encouragingly, a competitive energy density of ∼161 Wh kg-1 can be obtained by the NaCrO2 NWs-based full cell.

        "abstract": "There is a significant interest to develop high-performance and cost-effective electrode materials for next-generation sodium ion batteries. Herein, we report a facile synthesis method for nanosized V2O5/C composite cathodes and their electrochemical performance as well as energy storage mechanism. The composite exhibits a discharge capacity of 255 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 0.05 C, which surpasses that of previously reported layered oxide materials. Furthermore, the electrode shows good rate capability; discharge capacity of 160 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 1 C. The reaction mechanism of V2O5 upon sodium insertion/extraction is investigated using ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and synchrotron based near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. Ex situ XRD result of the fully discharged state reveals the appearance of NaV2O5 as a major phase with minor Na2V2O5 phase. Upon insertion of sodium into the array of parallel ladders of V2O5, it was confirmed that lattice parameter of c is increased by 9.09%, corresponding to the increase in the unit-cell volume of 9.2%. NEXAFS results suggest that the charge compensation during de/sodiation process accompanied by the reversible changes in the oxidation state of vanadium (V(4+) ↔ V(5+)).",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) as a promising technology for large-scale energy storage have received unprecedented attention. However, the cathodes in SIBs generally suffer from detrimental cathode-electrolyte interfacial side reactions and structural degradation during cycling, which leads to severe capacity fade and voltage decay. Here, we have developed an ultra-stable Na0.72Ni0.20Co0.21Mn0.55Mg0.036O2 (NCM-CS-GMg) cathode material in which a Mg-free core is encapsulated by a shell with gradient distribution of Mg using coprecipitation method with Mg-hysteretic cascade feedstock followed by calcination. From the interior to outer surface of the shell, as the content of electrochemically inactive Mg gradually increases, the Na+ deintercalation amount gradually decreases after charged. Benefiting from this surface gradient desodiation, the surface transition metal (TM) ion migration from TM layers to Na layers is effectively inhibited, thus suppressing the layered-to-rock-salt phase transition and the resultant microcracks. Besides, the less formation of high-valence TM ions on the surface contributes to a stable cathode-electrolyte interface. The as-prepared NCM-CS-GMg exhibits remarkable cycling life over 3000 cycles with a negligible voltage drop (0.127 mV per cycle). Our findings highlight an effective way to developing sustainable cathode materials without compromising on the initial specific capacity for SIBs.",

Here, a strategy is reported to realize high‐performance dual‐carbon SIHCs using 3D porous graphitic carbon cathode and anode materials derived from metal–azolate framework‐6s (MAF‐6s). First, MAF‐6s, with or without urea loading, are pyrolyzed to synthesize MAF‐derived carbons (MDCs). Then, cathode materials are synthesized via the controlled KOH‐assisted pyrolysis of MDCs (K‐MDCs). K‐MDCs, 3D graphitic carbons, resulting in a record‐high surface area (5214 m2 g−1) being ≈four‐fold higher than pristine MAF‐6, oxygen‐doped sites for high capacity, rich mesopores affording fast ion transport, and high capacity retention over 5000 charge/discharge cycles. Moreover, 3D porous MDC anode materials are synthesized from N‐containing MAF‐6 and exhibited to allow cycle stability over 5000 cycles. Furthermore, dual‐carbon MDC//K‐MDC SIHCs with different loadings (3 to 6 mg cm−2) are demonstrated to achieve high energy densities exceeding those of sodium‐ion batteries and supercapacitors.

Large oligomers of organosulfur can be formed during charging, and they are readily blocked by the nanosized ion‐conducting clusters in the Nafion membrane. In addition, large organosulfur monomers can also be blocked. Only 5.4% of TBBT diffuses through the Nafion membrane after 800 h. The Na|TBBT cell sustains 77% of the theoretical capacity after 300 cycles (2420 h). Moreover, the Na|TBBT redox flow cell shows promising rechargeability.

        "abstract": "Room‐temperature sodium–sulfur batteries are potential candidate for sustainable large‐scale energy storage systems due to their high energy density and low cost. However, the shuttling effect of high‐order polysulfides (Na2Sn, 4 < n ≤ 8) usually leads to rapid capacity fading, while the reaction kinetics of low‐order polysulfides (Na2Sn, 1 ≤ n ≤ 4) are slow. In this work, microporous‐mesoporous carbon derived from mangosteen peels is reported as cathode materials for RT Na–S batteries. The designed micro‐mesoporous structure not only effectively suppresses the shuttling effect of sodium polysulfides (NaPS), but also has high electrical conductivity and porosity, which facilitates electron/ion diffusion. Oxygen functional groups on the surface provide high catalytic activity for efficient low‐order NaPS conversion. The obtained Na–S battery exhibits high reversible capacity with excellent long‐term cycle performance (526.1 mAh g−1 at 4 A g−1 after 1000 cycles) and outstanding rate performance (676.59 mAh g−1 at 16 A g−1).

The results show that Na2O2 has good chemical and storage stability under a dry atmosphere and has no negative effect on the electrochemical performance of the cathode. Compared with the pristine cathode, the Na2O2-decorated cathode exhibits higher discharge capacity, superior capacity retention, and rate capability in a full cell with a carbon anode. Our cathode Na compensation strategy provides an effective avenue to make up for the irreversible Na+ loss cause by the formation of solid electrolyte interphase on the anode, thereby promoting the electrochemical performance and energy density of NIFCs toward the large-scale application.",

After screening various organic carbonates, a mixture of 30:70 wt.% ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate was chosen as the solvent. The optimal salt concentration, yielding the highest conductivity of 9.6 mS·cm−1 at 20 °C, was 0.8 mol·kg−1. Vinylene carbonate was selected as a SEI-stabilizing additive, and the electrolyte demonstrated stability up to 4.4 V vs. Li+/Li. LiFePO4 and LiMn0.6Fe0.4PO4 were identified as suitable cobalt-free cathode materials. They were processed using sodium carboxymethyl cellulose as a binder and water as the solvent. Performance testing of various cathode compositions was conducted using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic cycling with the LiPCP-based electrolyte and a standard LiPF6-based one. The optimized cathode compositions, with an 87:10:3 ratio of active material to conductive additive to binder, showed good compatibility and performance with the new electrolyte. Aqueous-processed LiFePO4 and LiMn0.6Fe0.4PO4 achieved capacities of 160 mAh·g−1 and 70 mAh·g−1 at C/10 after 40 cycles, respectively.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have important application prospects in large-scale energy storage due to their advantages, such as safety, affordability, and abundant resources. Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have a stable and open framework structure, making them a very promising cathode material. However, high-performance manganese-based Prussian blue cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries still suffer from significant challenges due to several key issues, such as a high number of vacancy defects and a high crystal water content. This article investigates the effects of the Fe-Mn molar ratio, Mn ion concentration, and reaction time on the electrochemical performance of MnHCF during the coprecipitation process. When Fe:Mn = 1:2, c(Mn2+) = 0.02 mol/L, and the reaction time is 12 h, the content of interstitial water molecules in the sample is low, and the Fe(CN)6 defects are few. At 0.1 C, the prepared electrode has a high initial discharge specific capacity (121.9 mAh g−1), and after 100 cycles at 0.2 C, the capacity retention rate is 65% (~76.2 mAh g−1). Meanwhile, the sample electrode exhibits excellent reversibility. The discharge capacity can still be maintained at around 75% when the magnification is restored from 5 C to 0.1 C. The improvement in performance is mainly attributed to two aspects: On the one hand, reducing the Fe(CN)6 defects and crystal water content is conducive to the diffusion and stable structure of N. On the other hand, reducing the reaction rate can significantly delay the crystallization of materials and optimize the nucleation process.",

        "abstract": "Solid-state electrolytes are crucial for next generation batteries with high energy density, long lasting and improved safety. The compatibility of most solid electrolytes with metallic anodes such as Li and Na metals, and cathodes such as sulfur, makes them suitable for high-capacity batteries (e.g., Li-S). They also address the safety concerns of current batteries by eliminating the flammable organic solvents in liquid electrolytes and by preventing/limiting dendrite formation.\n The lithium and sodium containing complex metal hydrides (e.g., LiBH4, NaBH4, LiCB11H12) have recently gained attention as solid-state electrolyte. They show high ionic conductivities but only at elevated temperatures (typically above 110 °C). Extending the high ionic conductivities to ambient temperatures is pivotal to the application of this fascinating class of solid electrolytes [1].\n In this contribution, we will use LiBH4 and NaBH4 as examples to show that the ionic conductivities of complex hydrides can be greatly enhanced through interface effects resulting from the formation of nanocomposites with metal oxides. This strategy can lead to several orders of magnitude increase in the room temperature ionic conductivity [2]. Using DSC, DRIFT, solid-state NMR, and XRS (Xray Raman scattering), I will discuss how nanocomposite formation and presence of interfaces modifies either the phase stability, the defect concentration and/or leads to the formation of tertiary phase, and thereby increase profoundly the ion mobility of the complex hydrides. Systematic studies with different oxide nanoscaffolds and surface modified metal oxides, reveal that these effects can be optimized by tuning/engineering the nanostructure and interfaces in the nanocomposites. [3-4]. We will show that the effects also depend on a complex interplay between the stability of the metal hydride and surface properties of the metal oxide.

        "abstract": "In the search for new cathode materials for sodium ion batteries, the exploration of polyanionic compounds has led to attractive candidates in terms of high redox potential and cycling stability. Herein we report the synthesis of the two new sodium transition-metal pentaborates Na3MB5O10 (M = Fe, Co), where Na3FeB5O10 represents the first sodium iron borate reported at present. By means of synchrotron X-ray diffraction, we reveal a layered structure consisting of pentaborate B5O10 groups connected through M2+ in tetrahedral coordination, providing possible three-dimensional Na-ion migration pathways. Inspired by these structural features, we examined the electrochemical performances versus sodium and showed that Na3FeB5O10 is active at an average potential of 2.5 V vs Na+/Na0, correlated to the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple as deduced from ex situ Mössbauer measurements. This contrasts with the case for Na3CoB5O10, which is electrochemically inactive. Moreover, we show that their electrochemical performances are kinetically limited, as deduced by complementary ac/dc conductivity measurements, hence confirming once again the complexity in designing high-performance borate-based electrodes.",

        "abstract": "In selecting electrolytes for Na‐ion batteries, simply importing the analogue of common Li‐ion battery electrolytes to Na‐ion batteries does not address safety concerns like toxicity and flammability. Electrolytes based on sodium bis(oxalato)borate (NaBOB) in organophosphates like triethyl phosphate (TEP) largely alleviate these specific safety concerns. However, it may be beneficial to obtain solutions with higher ionic conductivities than NaBOB in TEP, and compare the performance in Na‐ion batteries with high mass loading electrodes. Here, we have shown that N,N‐dimethyl formamide (DMF), N,N‐dimethyl acetamide (DMAc), and N‐methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) cosolvents almost double the ionic conductivity (from ~3.5 mS/cm to ~7 mS/cm) without sacrificing the flame‐retarding properties of the base NaBOB in TEP electrolyte. The physical properties of these cosolvent electrolyte mixtures are investigated, along with the electrochemical performance of these electrolytes full‐cells based on hard carbon anodes and Prussian white cathodes with near‐commercial areal capacity (~2 mAh/cm2).",

        "abstract": "\n Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are being viewed as a prime alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their resource availability, cost-effectiveness, safety, and superior power performance. Layered transition metal oxide cathode materials, in particular, have garnered interest for their high theoretical capacity and extended cycle life. This study focuses on the O3-type Na0.90Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48O2(NCFMO), synthesized using the polyvinylpyrrolidone combustion method, showcasing notable specific capacity and capacity retention of over 80% after 200 cycles at 1C. Hard carbon has been identified as a potential candidate for commercialization among various anode materials, due to its high reversible capacity and stable structure. We assembled and evaluated a coin SIB full cell comprised of an NCFMO cathode and hard carbon anode (HC), which demonstrated optimal electrochemical performance at a positive-to-negative capacity ratio of 0.9. The study also explored the influence of the electrolyte on electrochemical performance, with NaClO4 (0.1 M NaClO4 in PC = 100Vol% with 2.0þC) found to deliver the best results. Further, we assessed the heat generation characteristics of the NCFMO/HC full cell, revealing higher total heat generation during charging compared to discharging.

        "abstract": "Considering the abundance of iron and manganese within the Earth's crust, the cathode O3-NaFe0.5Mn0.5O2 has shown great potential for large-scale energy storage. Following the strategy of introducing specific heteroelements to optimize the structural stability for energy storage, the work has obtained an O3-type NaFe0.4Mn0.49Cu0.1Zr0.01O2 that exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance and air stability. It displays an initial reversible capacity of 147.5 mAh g-1 at 0.1C between 2 and 4.1 V, a capacity retention ratio exceeding 69.6% after 100 cycles at 0.2C, and a discharge capacity of 70.8 mAh g-1 at a high rate of 5C, which is superior to that of O3-NaFe0.5Mn0.5O2. The codoping of Cu/Zr reserves the layered O3 structure and enlarges the interlayer spacing, promoting the diffusion of Na+. In addition, the structural stability and air stability observed by Cu-doping is well maintained via the incorporation of extra Zr favoring a highly reversible phase conversion process. Thus, this work has demonstrated an efficient strategy for developing cobalt/nickel-free high-capacity and air-stable cathodes for sodium-ion batteries.",

In this work, its application in the structuring, coating and agglomeration of cathode materials for all-solid-state battery (ASSB) production is investigated, with the aim of increasing the homogeneity and conductivity of the composites and ultimately improving battery performance. In this process, different particle systems consisting of lithium iron phosphate (LFP), carbon black (CB) and sodium chloride (NaCl) are dispersed in the gas phase and brought together in a mixing zone as particle-laden aerosol jets. The cathode material’s structure is studied through scanning electron microscopy combined with a focussed ion beam (SEM–FIB). Electrical conductivity measurements of the resulting composites assess the degree of mixing and the changes in tortuosity, while a laser light diffractor and a cascade impactor analyse the particle size distribution (PSD). The jet-based process effectively produces hetero-agglomerates with the possibility of creating different composite structures by adjusting the process parameters. The mass concentration influences not only the structure, but also the PSD in the flow and the electrical conductivity of the composite. The results serve as a basis for future experiments with solid electrolytes to comprehensively evaluate the process and the resulting battery materials.",

        "abstract": "O'3-Na3Ni2SbO6 with a honeycomb cation order, as a potential cathode, presents simplified phase-transition steps and a high average voltage. To mitigate the intrinsic phase irreversibility, Mg, Zn, and Co have been introduced to displace part of the Ni, which inevitably reduces the theoretical capacity related to the Ni2+/Ni3+ redox reaction. In this work, an unusual dual-site substitution is carried out to increase the P'3-O'3 structure reversibility without sacrificing the practical capacity. In addition, it is found that special stacking faults along the c-axis direction can be induced by doping to result in incomplete Sb/Ni disorder, though the honeycomb order remains in every TM (transition-metal) layer. The codoped Na2.85Cs0.15Ni1.9Mg0.1SbO6 has a high degree of disorder, which breaks the ideal monoclinic symmetry (C2/m) and partly upgrades its structure to higher-symmetry models. Profiting from the influence of stacking disorder and doping ions on the coordination environment around Na, more gradual and smaller variations of the lattice parameters appear upon Na-ion extraction/insertion. Consequently, this cathode displays a high initial discharge capacity (120 mAh g-1), long-term cycling stability, and excellent rate performance (66 mAh g-1 under 10 C). These findings reveal that not only a full TM-disordered arrangement but also this incomplete stacking disorder can effectively improve the performance of a layered cathode.",

Rietveld refinement reveals that Na3.12Mn2.44(P2O7)2 adopts a triclinic structure ( P1̅ space group), which possesses spacious ion diffusion channels for facile sodium migration. The off-stoichiometric phase is able to offer more reversible Na+, delivering an enhanced reversible capacity of 114 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C, and because of the strong \"inductive effect\" that (P2O7)4- groups imposing on the Mn3+/Mn2+ redox couple, Na3.12Mn2.44(P2O7)2/C presents high platforms above 3.6 V, contributing a remarkable energy density of 376 W h kg-1, which is among the highest Fe-/Mn-based polyanion-type cathode materials.

        "abstract": "Safety hazards caused by flammable electrolytes have been major obstacles to the practical application of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The adoption of nonflammable all-phosphate electrolytes can effectively improve the safety of SIBs; however, traditional low-concentration phosphate electrolytes are not compatible with carbon-based anodes. Herein, we report an anion-cation interaction modulation strategy to design low-concentration phosphate electrolytes with superior physicochemical properties. Tris(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) phosphate (TFEP) is introduced as a cosolvent to regulate the ion-solvent-coordinated (ISC) structure through enhancing the anion-cation interactions, forming the stable anion-induced ISC (AI-ISC) structure, even at a low salt concentration (1.22 M). Through spectroscopy analyses and theoretical calculations, we reveal the underlying mechanism responsible for the stabilization of these electrolytes. Impressively, both the hard carbon (HC) anode and Na4Fe2.91(PO4)2(P2O7) (NFPP) cathode work well with the developed electrolytes. The designed phosphate electrolyte enables Ah-level HC//NFPP pouch cells with an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of over 99.9% and a capacity retention of 84.5% after 2000 cycles. In addition, the pouch cells can operate in a wide temperature range (-20 to 60 °C) and successfully pass rigorous safety testing.

        "abstract": "Fierce phase transformation and limited sodium ion diffusion dynamics are critical obstacles that hinder the practical energy storage applications of P2-type layered sodium transition metal oxides (NaxTMO2). Herein, a synergistic strategy of electronic state tailoring and pillar effect was carefully implemented by substituting divalent Mg2+ into Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 material with unique oriented hollow rodlike structures. Mg2+substitution can not only facilitate the anionic oxygen redox reactions and electronic conductivity through increasing the electronic states at Femi energy but also act as pillars within TMO2 layers to alleviate the severe phase transformation to improve structure stability. Moreover, the oriented hollow structure incorporating sufficient buffer spaces and rationally exposed electrochemically active facets effectively alleviates the stresses induced by low volume changes of 8% and provides more open channels for Na+ ion diffusion without crossing multiple grain boundaries. Hence, the Na0.67Mg0.08Ni0.25Mn0.67O2 cathode showed a superior rate capability with high energy density and cycling stability for sodium-ion storage. The underlying mechanisms of these achievements were deciphered through diversified dynamic analysis and the first principle calculations, providing new insights into P2-type NaxTMO2 cathodes for the infinite prospect as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Rapid capacity fading and structural collapse, along with other deep‐rooted challenges in the high‐voltage region, are insufficient to meet the requirements for commercial applications of O3‐type layered cathodes. Hereby, rare earth metal (RE) within the IIIB group are utilized as the robust dopants for O3‐NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) to achieve the purpose of reconstructing the crystal lattice and regulating the interlayer structure. The inactive RE3+ acts as a pillar, reinforces the TMO6 octahedron, and broadens the Na+ diffusion layer in the configuration of O‐Na‐O‐TM (RE)‐O‐Na‐O, giving rise to the enhanced crystal stability and accelerating the transmission of sodium ions. More impressively, the scandium incorporation is working as a “vitamin” that improves Ni/Fe redox reversibility, alleviating the irreversible P3‐O3’‐P3’ phase transformation and further restraining the disordered Fe migration into the neighboring Na layer, which is firmly validated by in situ X‐ray diffraction coupled with the synchrotron X‐ray absorption spectroscopy. Consequently, the as‐designed NFM‐Sc exhibits impressive rate capability (82.5 mAh g−1 at 10 C) and excellent cycle stability with 80.2% capacity retention after 500 cycles at the high voltage of 4.2 V. Given this, the elaborate work may shed new insight into the operational mechanism of rare metal through strategically regulating the structure for sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The Mn-based polyanion compound Na3MnTi(PO4)3 (NMTP) with a Na superionic conductor (NASICON) structure has attracted incremental attention as a potential cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. However, the occupation of Mn2+ on Na+ vacancies usually leads to severe voltage hysteresis, which in turn results in significant capacity loss, slow Na+ diffusion kinetics, and poor cycling stability. Herein, anion-substituted compounds Na3MnTi(PO4)3-x(SiO4)x (x = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) are synthesized. It reveals that the SiO44- substitution could induce partial oxidation of Mn2+ to Mn3+, and the latter has a lower occupancy preference on Na+ vacancies. By the proposed charge compensation strategy, the Mn2+ occupation on Na+ vacancies can be significantly suppressed. As a result, the voltage hysteresis is substantially inhibited, and greatly improved electrochemical performance is achieved. This study offers an alternative strategy to address the voltage hysteresis associated with NMTP and other Mn-based NASICON cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "Mixed-anion-group Fe-based phosphate materials, such as Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7, have emerged as promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the synthesis of pure-phase material has remained a challenge, and the phase evolution during sodium (de)intercalation is debating as well. Herein, a solid-solution strategy is proposed to partition Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 into 2NaFePO4·Na2FeP2O7 from the angle of molecular composition. Via regulating the starting ratio of NaFePO4 and Na2FeP2O7 during the synthesis process, the nonstoichiometric pure-phase material could be successfully synthesized within a narrow NaFePO4 content between 1.6 and 1.2. Furthermore, the proposed synthesis strategy demonstrates strong applicability that helps to address the impurity issue of Na4Co3(PO4)2P2O7 and nonstoichiometric Na3.4Co2.4(PO4)1.4P2O7 are evidenced to be the pure phase. The model Na3.4Fe2.4(PO4)1.4P2O7 cathode (the content of NaFePO4 equals 1.4) demonstrates exceptional sodium storage performances, including ultrahigh rate capability under 100 C and ultralong cycle life over 14000 cycles. Furthermore, combined measurements of ex-situ nuclear magnetic resonance, in-situ synchrotron diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy clearly reveal a two-phase transition during Na+ extraction/insertion, which provides a new insight into the ionic storage process for such kind of mixed-anion-group Fe-based phosphate materials and pave the way for the development of high-power sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "How to tune the activity and reversibility of oxygen anion redox (OAR) is a critical issue for O3‐type sodium‐ion battery (SIB) cathodes. Herein, the key role of electronegativity‐difference configuration on the activation of OAR is find out, and further tune electronegativity‐difference configuration with La incorporation to construct non‐bonded O 2p orbitals and achieve the reversible anionic redox in O3‐type NaMn1/3Fe1/3Ni1/3O2. Owing to the special extranuclear electronic structure of La3+ [Xe], the La electron cloud is difficult to be disturbed by the O electron cloud, and some O electrons do not participate in the formation of ionic bonds, thus retaining the non‐bonded electrons of O 2p and activating OAR. Moreover, La3+ doping also decreases the Coulomb force between Na+ and O2− favoring Na+ migration as well as strengthening the La─O bonds inhibiting the irreversible phase transition. La2O3 coating layer also plays a role on inhibiting the reaction between molecular oxygen and the electrolyte, and making OAR reversible. After modification, the cycling stability is significantly improved (86.9% vs 27.3%@2C@200cycles; 90.8% vs 52.9%@5C@300 cycles). This study presents some insights on OAR activation mechanism and offers a facile strategy to improve the activity and reversibility of OAR for designing high performance SIBs cathodes.",

In this study, Cu and Mg modifications were introduced to inhibit the P2-O2 phase transition and increase the lattice spacing, thereby reducing the resistance of sodium ion de-embedding and intercalation to improve the overall electrochemical performance of the battery. A series of P2-type Na0.67Ni0.33-xMn0.67CuxO2 and Na0.67Ni0.33-xMn0.67MgxO2 cathode materials were synthesized through solid-state reaction. Cu substitution significantly alters the structural stability and electrochemical properties. In the voltage range from 1.5 to 4.2 V and at 0.1 C, the initial discharge specific capacity of Na0.67Ni0.18Mn0.67Cu0.15O2 was 167 mAh·g-1, with 86 mAh·g-1 remaining after 100 cycles at 1 C. Additionally, a high discharge specific capacity of 207 mAh·g-1 was achieved with 0.075 Mg doping, suggesting that part of O2- participated in the internal electrochemical reaction. Furthermore, the rate performance of Na0.67Ni0.28Mn0.67Mg0.05O2 was found to be the best. This phenomenon was attributed to the inactive Mg2+ retaining more Na+ in the interlayer, inhibiting crystal structure transformation and Jahn-Teller distortion. The larger radius of Mg2+ increased the layer spacing, widened the Na+ de-embedding channels, and increased the diffusion coefficient.",

We deconvolve the cation/anion redox mechanisms of Li+-insertion in alkali-rich chalcogenides by modulating the transition metal–sulfide electronic band structure via systematic metal substitution for iron in Li2Fe1–xMxS2. Key electrochemical characteristics (cation/anion redox potential, Li+-insertion capacity, reversibility) will be correlated with electronic and structural properties as a function of chalcogenide composition using such techniques as X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman scattering. Experimental results will be compared with density functional theory (DFT) calculations of analogous model systems. Understanding the relationship between band structure and reversible charge-storage will guide the design of alkali-rich chalcogenides that are candidates to transition into commercial Li-ion batteries. Due to the absence of oxygen in the chalcogenide crystal structure, batteries that use these as cathode materials will be inherently safer to operate at elevated temperatures and challenging charge–discharge duty cycles. \n \n C.J.

However the NaxMn[Fe(CN)6]y prepared by simple co-precipitation of Mn2+ and [Fe(CN)6]4- usually show poor cycling performance which hinder their practical application. In this work, electrochemical performance of a Na1.6Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.9 (PBM) sample prepared by simple precipitation method was greatly improved by coating with Na3(VOPO4)2F (NVOPF) via a solution precipitation method. The as-prepared PBM@NVOPF with a coating quantity of 2.0 % molar ratio showed enhanced rate capability and superior cyclic stability. The discharge capacities of PBM@NVOPF were 101.5 mAh g-1 (1C) and 91.4 mAh g-1 (10C), with capacity retention of 84.3% after 500 cycles at 1C, 20 °C. It also exhibited excellent cyclic stability at elevated temperature with initial capacity of 109.5 mAh g-1 and capacity retention of 78.8% after 200 cycles at 1C, 55 °C. In comparison, uncoated PBM showed discharge capacity of 105.7 mAh g-1 (1C) and 76.7 mAh g-1 (10C), with capacity retention of only 42.0% after 500 cycles at 1C, 20 °C. The high temperature performance of bare PBM was very poor the capacity retention was only 35.7% after 40 cycles due to serious Mn/Fe dissolution which caused structural deterioration of PBM. NVOPF coating protected the PBM from suffering corrosion in the electrolyte thus ensured the framework stability of PBM during long term cycling and contributed to the excellent electrochemical performance.",

However, their rate capability and durability are limited by tortuous Na+ diffusion channels and complicated phase evolution during Na+ extraction/insertion. Here we report our findings in unravelling the mechanism for dramatically enhancing the stability and rate capability of O3-NaNi0.5Mn0.5-xSbxO2 (NaNMS) by substitutional Sb doping, which can alter the coordination environment and chemical bonds of the transition metal (TM) ions in the structure, resulting in a more stable structure with wider Na+ transport channels. Furthermore, NaNMS nanoparticles are obtained by surface energy regulation during grain growth. The synergistic effect of Sb doping and nanostructuring greatly reduces the ionic migration energy barrier while increasing the reversibility of the structural evolution during repeated Na+ extraction/insertion. An optimized NaNMS-1 electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 212.3 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C and 74.5 mAh g-1 at 50 C with minimal capacity loss after 100 cycles at a low temperature of -20 °C.

Additionally, NVFP‐HE can also retain 66.7% of initial capacity after 10 000 charge–discharge cycles at 50C. It is important to highlight that the high entropy mitigates the performance decay that arises from the irreversible phase change at 4 V. Interestingly, NVFP‐HE//HC full cell delivers 81 mAh g−1 at 0.2C.

DFT calculations suggest that the intermediate phase, Na1.5 FePO4 F, adopts the space group of P21 /c, which is a subgroup (P21 /b11, No. 14) of Pbcn (No. 60), the space group of the starting phase, Na2 FePO4 F, and this space group provides a good fit to the experimental XRD and NMR results.

        "abstract": "As global energy storage demand increases, sodium‐ion batteries are often considered as an alternative to lithium‐ion batteries. Hexacyanoferrate cathodes, commonly referred to as Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), are of particular interest due their low‐cost synthesis and promising electrochemical response. However, because they consist of ~50 wt% cyanide anions, a possible release of highly toxic cyanide gases poses a significant safety risk. Previously, we observed the evolution of (CN)2 during cycling via differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), but were unable to determine a root cause or mechanism. In this work, we present a systematical investigation of the gas evolution of Prussian white (PW) with different water content via DEMS. While H2 is the main gas detected, especially in hydrated PW and during overcharge (4.6 V vs. Na+/Na), the evolution of CO2 and (CN)2 depends on the electrolyte conductive salt. The use of oxidative NaClO4 instead of NaPF6 is the leading cause for the formation of (CN)2. Mass spectrometric evidence of trace amounts of HCN is also found, but to a much lower extent than (CN)2, which is the dominant safety risk when using NaClO4‐containing electrolyte. Despite being a good model salt, it is not a viable option for commercial applications.",

        "abstract": "The practical application of Li-S batteries, which hold great potential as energy storage devices, is impeded by various challenges, such as capacity degradation caused volume change, polysulfide shuttling, poor electrode kinetics, and safety concerns. Binder plays a crucial role in suppressing volume change of cathode side, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries. In this research, a novel network binder (SA-Co-PEDOT) composed of sodium alginate is presented, Co2+ ions as cross-linking agent and PEDOT as an electronic conductor. The theoretical analysis and experimental testing confirm that the SA-Co-PEDOT binder with synergistic combination of catalytic center and electron transfer network effectively mitigates large volumetric changes during cycling while simultaneously enhancing electrode kinetics through controlling the deposition morphology of sulfur end product and its nucleation and dissolution. As a result, it achieves a capacity of 844 mAh g-1 after 150 cycles at 0.2 C. Moreover, the electrode with SA-Co-PEDOT binder subjected a bending test maintains a capacity of 395 mAh g-1 after 500 cycles at 0.5 C, exhibiting an impressively low decay rate of only 0.11%. Even with an ultra-low content of 2 wt.% SA-Co-PEDOT binder, the electrode still maintains a capacity of 999.7 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.5 C.",

Nevertheless, the inevitable interface problems like sluggish interfacial electrochemical reaction kinetics and poor interfacial ion storage capacity seriously hinder its application. Construction of chemical bonding is a highly effective way to solve interface problems. Herein, NVPOF with interfacial V-F-C bonding (CB-NVPOF) is developed. The CB-NVPOF cathode exhibits high rate capability (65 mA h g-1 at 40C) and long-term cycling stability (a capacity retention of 77% after 2000 cycles at 20C). Furthermore, it shows impressive electrochemical performance at temperatures as low as -40 °C, delivering a capacity of 56 mA h g-1 at 10C and a capacity retention of ∼80% after 500 cycles at 2C. The interfacial V-F-C bond engineering significantly advances the electronic conductivity, Na+ diffusion, as well as interface compatibility at -40 °C.

Sodium dihydrogen phosphate is of good contact with lithium-rich materials in the process of high-temperature melting to facilitate surface sodium doping which is conducive to stabilizing the surface structure through lithium-sodium exchange. At the same time, the phosphate coating produced by lithium-sodium exchange and dehydration on the outer surface of the material can effectively inhibit the corrosion of the electrolyte.

        "abstract": "An anionic redox reaction is an extraordinary method for obtaining high-energy-density cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The commonly used inactive-element-doped strategies can effectively trigger the O redox activity in several layered cathode materials. However, the anionic redox reaction process is usually accompanied by unfavorable structural changes, large voltage hysteresis, and irreversible O2 loss, which hinders its practical application to a large extent. In the present work, we take the doping of Li elements into Mn-based oxide as an example and reveal the local charge trap around the Li dopant will severely impede O charge transfer upon cycling. To overcome this obstacle, additional Zn2+ codoping is introduced into the system. Theoretical and experimental studies show that Zn2+ doping can effectively release the charge around Li+ and homogeneously distribute it on Mn and O atoms, thus reducing the overoxidation of O and improving the stability of the structure. Furthermore, this change in the microstructure makes the phase transition more reversible. This study aimed to provide a theoretical framework for further improve the electrochemical performance of similar anionic redox systems and provide insights into the activation mechanism of the anionic redox reaction.",

        "abstract": "Ni/Mn-based oxide cathode materials have drawn great attention due to their high discharge voltage and large capacity, but structural instability at high potential causes rapid capacity decay. How to moderate the capacity loss while maintaining the advantages of high discharge voltage remains challenging. Herein, the replacement of Mn ions by Ga ions is proposed in the P2-Na2/3 Ni0.2 Mn0.8 O2 cathode for improving their cycling performances without sacrificing the high discharge voltage. With the introduction of Ga ions, the relative movement between the transition metal ions is restricted and more Na ions are retained in the lattice at high voltage, leading to an enhanced redox activity of Ni ions, validated by ex situ synchrotron X-ray absorption spectrum and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Additionally, the P2-O2 phase transition is replaced by a P2-OP4 phase transition with a smaller volume change, reducing the lattice strain in the c-axis direction, as detected by operando/ex situ X-ray diffraction. Consequently, the Na2/3 Ni0.21 Mn0.74 Ga0.05 O2 electrode exhibits a high discharge voltage close to that of the undoped materials, while increasing voltage retention from 79% to 93% after 50 cycles.

        "abstract": "Layered oxides exhibit interesting performance as positive electrodes for commercial sodium-ion batteries. Nevertheless, the replacement of low-sustainable nickel with more abundant iron would be desirable. Although it can be achieved in P2-Na2/3Ni2/9Fe2/9Mn5/9O2, its performance still requires further improvement. Many imaginative strategies such as surface modification have been proposed to minimize undesirable interactions at the cathode–electrolyte interface while facilitating sodium insertion in different materials. Here, we examine four different approaches based on the use of the electron-conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) as an additive: (i) electrochemical in situ polymerization of the monomer, (ii) manual mixing with the active material, (iii) coating the current collector, and (iv) a combination of the latter two methods. As compared with pristine layered oxide, the electrochemical performance shows a particularly effective way of increasing cycling stability by using electropolymerization. Contrarily, the mixtures show less improvement, probably due to the heterogeneous distribution of oxide and polymer in the samples. In contrast with less conductive polyanionic cathode materials such as phosphates, the beneficial effects of PEDOT on oxide cathodes are not as much in rate performance as in inhibiting cycling degradation, due to the compactness of the electrodes without loss of electrical contact between active particles.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing demand for clean energy sources, the need for large-scale energy storage systems to ensure the stable output of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, has also increased. Sodium-ion batteries have emerged as a potential solution for these storage systems owing to their high energy density, abundance in the Earth's crust, and low cost. However, the larger atomic radius of sodium ions results in higher energy barriers for ion migration in cathode materials, which can affect the cycle life and rate performance of the battery. Therefore, developing a suitable structure that facilitates rapid sodiation and desodiation and maintains good cycling stability remains a significant challenge. This study aimed to reduce the content of trivalent manganese ions and minimize the impact of the Jahn-Teller effect to enhance the capacity retention of manganese-based layered oxides. Additionally, a series of P2-type Na0.78Li0.1ZnxNi0.15-xMn0.75O2 compounds were successfully synthesized through doping with divalent zinc ions. Structural analyses of the doped material indicated that Zn doping did not alter the crystal structure but increased the interlayer distance of the transition metals. Electrochemical performance tests revealed that appropriate Zn2+ doping promoted sodium-ion diffusion and improved the reversible capacity of the battery.

In the molecular crystals, we compute the maximum voltages to be 3.5 V for Li and 3.3 V for Na, with theoretical capacities of 1247 mA h g(-1) for Li and 416 mA h g(-1) for Na. In the covalent crystals, the maximum voltages are 2.2 V for Li and 2.7 V for Na, and theoretical capacities are 394 mA h g(-1) for Li and 176 mA h g(-1) for Na. Significantly, up to a capacity of 416 mA h g(-1) for both Li and Na in the molecular crystal and 197 mA h g(-1) for Li and 176 mA h g(-1) for Na in the covalent crystal, the insertion of Li and Na would not lead to reactions with common electrolytes. We show that volumetric capacities of organic electrodes need not be low compared to their inorganic counterparts, contrary to popular belief: the molecular TCNE crystal has been computed to achieve the values of 1845 mA h cm(-3) for Li and 615 mA h cm(-3) for Na, respectively.

Moreover, in situ X-ray diffraction and in situ Raman spectroscopy results demonstrate the robust crystalline framework and reversible phase transformation between cubic and rhombohedral within the charge-discharge process.

The redox chemistry from the p-type ligand and π–d hybridization center endows the Ni3(HATQ)2 cathode with high capacity and good rate performance, especially excellent capacity retention of 95% after 1000 cycles. These findings provide a promising avenue for the exploration of other p-type multidentate chelating ligands toward new 2D c-MOFs and expand the application of 2D c-MOFs in energy storage systems.",

        "abstract": "Layered transition metal oxides are commonly used as the cathode materials in sodium-ion batteries due to their low cost and easy manufacturing. However, the application is hindered by poor rate performance and complex phase transitions. To address these challenges, a new seven-component high-entropy layered oxide cathode material, O3-NaNi0.25Fe0.15Mn0.3Ti0.1Sn0.05Co0.05Li0.1O2 (HEO) has been developed. The entropy stabilization effect plays a crucial role in improving the performance of electrochemical systems and the stability of structures. The HEO exhibits a specific discharge capacity of 154.1 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C and 94.5 mA h g-1 at 7 C. In-situ and ex-situ XRD results demonstrate that the HEO effectively retards complex phase transitions. This work provides a high-entropy design for the storage materials with a high energy density. Meanwhile, it eliminates industry doubts about the performance of sodium ion layered oxide cathode materials.",

In order to maintain the perfect fibrous architecture of the Na3V2(PO4)3/C samples after calcining, a series of heat treatment parameters are studied in detail. It is found that the heat treatment process shows important influence on the morphology and electrochemical performance of Na3V2(PO4)3/C composite nanofibers. Under the calcining conditions of 800°C for 10 h with a heating rate of 2.5°C min−1, the well-crystallized uniform Na3V2(PO4)3/C nanofibers with excellent electrochemical performances are successfully obtained. The initial discharge specific capacities of the nanofibers at 0.05, 1, and 10C are 114.0, 106.0, and 77.9 mAh g−1, respectively. The capacity retention still remains 97.0% after 100 cycles at 0.05C.

        "abstract": "Residual alkali is one of the biggest challenges for the commercialization of sodium-based layered transition metal oxide cathode materials since it can even inevitably appear during the production process. Herein, taking O3-type Na0.9Ni0.25Mn0.4Fe0.2Mg0.1Ti0.05O2 as an example, an active strategy is proposed to reduce residual alkali by slowing the cooling rate, which can be achieved in one-step preparation method. It is suggested that slow cooling can significantly enhance the internal uniformity of the material, facilitating the reintegration of Na+ into the bulk material during the calcination cooling phase, therefore substantially reducing residual alkali. The strategy can remarkably suppress the slurry gelation and gas evolution and enhance the structural stability. Compared to naturally cooled cathode materials, the capacity retention of the slowly cooled electrode material increases from 76.2% to 85.7% after 300 cycles at 1 C. This work offers a versatile approach to the development of advanced cathode materials toward practical applications.",

        "abstract": "The rapid electrification of our society and the transition towards a larger share of intermittent renewable energy sources in our electricity grids will dramatically increase the demand for cheap energy storage. Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) show a lot of promise to provide the required stationary storage at the grid level at low cost owing to the natural abundance and geographical availability of sodium. In addition, alkali-rich cathode materials exhibiting anionic redox contributions have garnered much attention over the past decade as a strategy to increase the specific capacity. In this work, we investigate for the first time the sodium-rich compound Na5FeO4 as a potential low-cost, environment-friendly cathode for sodium ion batteries from first principles using density functional theory. We investigate three low-energy polymorphs related to the antifluorite structure, verify their dynamical and mechanical stabilities, and show that they exhibit promising ion diffusive properties. As alkali-rich cathode materials are prone to oxygen loss during cycling, we investigate cycling stability with respect to phase transformations and oxygen loss and identify in particular one promising cycling interval that can reversibly shuttle 1.5 Na+ per formula unit between Na5FeO4 and Na3.5FeO4 with a gravimetric energy density exceeding 360 W h kg−1. Investigations into possible redox mechanisms reveal that the charge compensation occurs simultaneously on Fe- and O-atoms in FeO4-tetrahedra, which suggests that Na5FeO4, if realised experimentally as a cathode material, would join the family of combined cationic/anionic redox compounds.",

        "abstract": "Manganese-rich layered oxide materials hold great potential as low-cost and high-capacity cathodes for Na-ion batteries. However, they usually form P2 phase and suffer from fast capacity fade. In this work, an O3 phase sodium cathode has been developed out of a Li and Mn-rich layered material by leveraging the creation of transition metal (TM) and oxygen vacancies and the electrochemical exchange of Na and Li. The Mn-rich layered cathode material remains primarily O3 phase during sodiation/desodiation and can have a full sodiation capacity of ~220 mAh/g. It delivers ~160 mAh/g specific capacity between 2-3.8V with >86% retention over 250 cycles. Systematic characterizations and computational studies revealed that the TM and oxygen vacancies pre-formed in the sodiated material enables a \"reversible\" migration of TMs from the TM layer to the tetrahedral sites in the Na layer upon de-sodiation and sodiation. The migration creates metastable states, leading to increased kinetic barrier that prohibits a complete O3-P3 phase transition, hence stabilizing the structure and battery performance. This work provides a critical insight on the role of vacancies in TM migration and stabilization of phase transition, and sheds light on the future development of high performance and stable cathode materials for Na-ion batteries and beyond.",

        "abstract": "Though considerable Mg-doped layered cathodes have been exploited, some new differences relative to previous reports can be concluded by doping a heavy dose of Mg via two rational strategies. Unlike the common unit cell of the P63/mmc group by X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction reveals a large supercell of the P63 group and enhanced ordering for Na11/18Mg1/18[Ni1/4Mg1/9Mn11/18]O2 with Mg occupying both the Na and Mn sites. Compared with only one obvious voltage plateau of Na0.5[Ni0.25Mn0.75]O2 (NNM), Na11/18Mg1/18[Ni1/4Mg1/9Mn11/18]O2 (NMNMM) shows more severe voltage plateaus but with excellent electrochemical performance. Na0.5[Mg0.25Mn0.75]O2 (NMM) with Mg only occupying the Ni site displays a highly reversible whole-voltage-range oxygen redox chemistry and smooth voltage curves without any voltage hysteresis. Cationic Ni2+/Ni4+ couples are responsible for the charge compensations of NNM and NMNMM, while only the oxygen anionic reaction accounts for the capacity of NMM between 2.5 and 4.3 V. Interestingly, the Mn3+/Mn4+ pair contributes all capacity for all cathodes between 1.5 and 2.5 V. All cathodes undergo a double-phase mechanism: an irreversible P2-O2 phase transition for NNM, an enhanced reversible P2-O2 phase transition for NMNMM, and a highly reversible P2-OP4 phase transition for NMM. In addition, the designed cathodes display excellent rate capability and long-term cycling stability but with a large difference in the various voltage ranges of 2.5-4.3 and 1.5-2.5 V, respectively. This work provides a good understanding of ion doping and some new insights into exploiting high-performance materials.",

X-ray photoelectron spectra, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectra show that the P2-structure and the oxidation state of cobalt and manganese of the pristine oxide are not affected by CeO2 surface modification, and a small amount of Ce4+ ions have been reduced to Ce3+ ions, and a few Ce ions have entered the crystal lattice of the P2-oxide surface during modification with CeO2. In a voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V at a current density of 20 mA g−1, 2.00 wt% CeO2-modified Na0.67Co0.25Mn0.75O2 delivers a maximum discharge capacity of 135.93 mA h g−1, and the capacity retentions are 91.96% and 83.38% after 50 and 100 cycles, respectively.

        "abstract": "NASICON‐type cathode with remarkable ionic conductivity is perspective candidate for fast‐charging sodium‐ion battery. However, severely restricted by low electrical conductivity and poor interfacial kinetics, it usually delivers poor charge transfer kinetics. Different from traditional carbon compositing with high carbon contents, herein, a trace carbon incorporation tactic is proposed based on a typical NASICON‐structured Na3V2(PO4)3. First, particle‐growth process of Na3V2(PO4)3 is regulated via incorporating carbon dot, significantly reducing its particle size to shorten charge diffusion path. Second, electrical conductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3 is improved without sacrificing its high electrochemical activity due to the incorporated trace carbon content (0.76 wt.%). Third, Na3V2(PO4)3‐electrolyte interface structure is optimized by abundant functional groups from the incorporated carbon dot, enabling a thin and stable NaF‐rich CEI layer to boost interface kinetics. As a result, carbon dot endows Na3V2(PO4)3 with ultrastable cyclability up to 20 k cycles (capacity retention of 98.4%) and excellent rate capability (up to 200 C) in half cell, as well as high energy density (368.7 Wh kg−1) and fast charging property (≈110.2 s per charging with 250.8 Wh kg−1 input) in full cell.

Electrical characterization, including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, C-rate testing up to 6~C under different ambient temperatures, along with cyclic aging studies, provided insights into the cells’ performance and degradation mechanisms. The findings highlighted variations in electrode coatings, particle sizes, and cathode materials among the cells, which were then correlated with their electrical behavior.

The unique ability of biological systems to guide molecule self-assembling facilitates the construction of distinctive architectures with desirable physicochemical characteristics. Herein, we report a biochemistry-directed \"bottom-up\" approach to construct hollow porous microspheres of polyanion materials for sodium ion batteries. Two kinds of polyanions, i.e. Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na3.12Fe2.44(P2O7)2, are employed as cases in this study. The microalgae cell realizes the formation of a spherical \"bottom\" bio-precursor. Its tiny core is subjected to destruction and its tough shell tends to carbonize upon calcination, resulting in the hollow porous microspheres for the \"top\" product. The nanoscale crystals of the polyanion materials are tightly enwrapped by the highly-conductive framework in the hollow microsphere, resulting in the hierarchical nano-microstructure. The whole formation process is disclosed as a \"bottom-up\" mechanism. Moreover, the biochemistry-directed self-assembly process is confirmed to play a crucial role in the construction of the final architecture. Taking advantage of the well-defined hollow-microsphere architecture, the abundant interior voids and the highly-conductive framework, polyanion materials show favourable sodium-intercalation kinetics. Both materials are capable of high-rate long-term cycling. After five hundred cycles at 20 C and 10 C, Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na(3.12)Fe2.44(P2O7)2 retain 96.2% and 93.1% of the initial capacity, respectively.

Furthermore, the flexible GPA film was also tested as cathode for SIBs and demonstrated a high-rate capability with 72 mAh g-1 at 5 C and an ultralong cycling stability (71.4% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 0.5 C) which has rarely been achieved before. Such excellent electrochemical performance of GPA as cathode for both LIBs and SIBs could be ascribed to the fast redox kinetics and electron transportation within GPA, resulting from the interconnected conductive framework of graphene and the intimate interaction between graphene and PAQS through an efficient wrapping structure. This approach opens a universal way to develop cathode materials for powerful batteries with different metal-based counter electrodes.",

        "abstract": "Tin-based composites hold promise as anodes for high-capacity lithium/sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs), yet the necessity of using carbon coated nano-sized tin to solve the issues related to large volume changes during electrochemical cycling, thus leading to the low volumetric capacity for tin-based composites due to their low packing density. Herein, we design a highly dense graphene encapsulated nitrogen-doped carbon@Sn (HD N-C@Sn/G) compact monolith with Sn nanoparticles double-encapsulated by N-C and graphene, which exhibits a high density of 2.6 g cm-3 and a high conductivity of 212 S m-1. The as-obtained HD N-C@Sn/G monolith anode exhibits ultrahigh and durable volumetric lithium/sodium storage. Specifically, it delivers a high volumetric capacity of 2692 mAh cm-3 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 and an ultra-long cycling stability exceeding 1500 cycles at 1.0 A g-1 with only 0.019% capacity decay per cycle in lithium ion batteries. Besides, in-situ TEM and ex-situ SEM have revealed that the unique double-encapsulated structure effectively mitigates drastic volume variation of the tin nanoparticles during electrode cycling. Furthermore, the full cell using HD N-C@Sn/G as anode and LiCoO2 as cathode displays a superior cycling stability. This work provides a new avenue and deep insight into the design of high-volumetric-capacity alloy-based anode with ultra-long cycle life.",

        "abstract": "Chemical presodiation (CP) is an effective strategy to enhance energy density of sodium ion batteries. However, the sodiation reagents reported so far are basically polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) wth low reductive potential (~0.1 V vs. Na+/Na), which could easily cause over-sodiation and structural deterioration of the presodiated cathodes. In this work, Aromatic ketones (AKs) are rationally designed as mild presodiating reagents by introducing a carbonyl group (C=O) into PAHs to balance the conjugated and inductive effect. As the representatives, two compounds 9-Fluorenoneb (9-FN) and Benzophenone (BP) manifest favorable equilibrium potential of 1.55 V and 1.07 V (vs. Na+/Na), respectively. Note that 9-FN demonstrates versatile presodiating capability toward multiple Na uptake hosts (tunneled Na0.44MnO2, layered Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2, polyanionic Na4Fe2.91(PO4)2P2O7, Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)2F3), enabling greatly improved initial charging capacity of the cathode to balance the irrevisible capacity of the anode. Our results indicate that the Aromatic ketones are competitive presodiating cathodic reagents for high-performance sodium-ion batteries, and will inspire more studies and application attempts in the future.",

Moreover, the symmetrical sodium-ion full cell with excellent reversibility and cycling stability was also achieved (capacity retention: 92.2 % at 0.1 A g(-1) with 99.5 % coulombic efficiency after 100 cycles).

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion battery (SIB) technology started to bloom along with lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) as a supportive energy source to alleviate the cost of lithium sources for the development of energy storage devices and electric vehicles. Layered cathode materials are considered potential candidates to produce high-energy-density batteries. Among the layered cathode materials, P3-type cathodes are the least investigated in spite of their capacities, which are comparable to those of P2-type cathodes. P3-type cathodes show high polarization, leading to a poor cycle life, which impedes their extensive use in practical applications. In this work, we report on zirconium doping as an effective strategy to improve cycling stability and reduce voltage fading, another serious issue of layered cathode materials. It is found that an optimum composition of the P3-type cathode with Zr doping at the Mn site, leading to a composition of Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.64Zr0.033O2, shows good electrochemical performance in terms of retention (89% after 100 cycles) when compared to Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.60Zr0.067O2 (85% after 100 cycles) and an undoped sample (83% after 100 cycles). Also, remarkable performance is delivered by the Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.64Zr0.033O2 sample, with a retention rate of 72% after 450 cycles. This result is also supported by an analysis of the amount of polarization for undoped and doped samples, which found that doping helps in improving the diffusion of ions, and the least polarization is obtained for the Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.64Zr0.033O2 sample.",

        "abstract": "The development of solid‐state sodium‐ion batteries (SSSBs) heavily hinges on the development of an superionic Na+ conductor (SSC) that features high conductivity, (electro)chemical stability, and deformability. The construction of heterogeneous structures offers a promising approach to comprehensively enhancing these properties in a way that differs from traditional structural optimization. Here, this work exploits the structural variance between high‐ and low‐coordination halide frameworks to develop a new class of halide heterogeneous structure electrolytes (HSEs). The halide HSEs incorporating a UCl3‐type high‐coordination framework and amorphous low‐coordination phase achieves the highest Na+ conductivity (2.7 mS cm−1 at room temperature, RT) among halide SSCs so far. By discerning the individual contribution of the crystalline bulk, amorphous region, and interface, this work unravels the synergistic ion conduction within halide HSEs and provides a comprehensive explanation of the amorphization effect. More importantly, the excellent deformability, high‐voltage stability, and expandability of HSEs enable effective SSSB integration. Using a cold‐pressed cathode electrode composite of uncoated Na0.85Mn0.5Ni0.4Fe0.1O2 and HSEs, the SSSBs present stable cycle performance with a capacity retention of 91.0% after 100 cycles at 0.2 C.",

        "abstract": "Iron-based Prussian blue (FeHCF) has great application potential in the large-scale production of sodium-ion (Na+) batteries because of its high theoretical capacity and abundant Fe ore resources. However, the Fe(CN)6 vacancies and crystal water seriously affect the electrochemical performance. Herein, a Cu-doped FeHCF (Cu-FeHCF) cathode material is successfully prepared directly by a coprecipitation method. After Cu doping, the monoclinic structure and the quasi-cubic morphology are retained, but the electrochemical performance is significantly improved. In addition to few Fe(CN)6 vacancies and low crystal water, the improved performance is also related to the enhanced electrochemical activity of low-spin Fe and the stabilizing effect of Cu on the crystal structure. Moreover, Cu doping also controls the side reaction to a certain extent. As a result, after Cu doping, the initial discharge capacity is enhanced from 107.9 to 127.4 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1, especially the capacities contributed by low-spin Fe increase from 30.0, 21.7, and 16.7 mA h g-1 to 48.8, 45.4, and 43.7 mA h g-1 for the first three cycles, respectively. Even at 2 A g-1, Cu-FeHCF still has a promising initial capacity of 82.3 mA h g-1 and only a 0.047% capacity decay rate for each cycle over 500 cycles.

        "abstract": "With the present materials supply crunch caused by the burgeoning Li-ion battery-based electric vehicle market, more sustainable battery chemistries are needed. When considering possible chemistries, sodium (Na) and iron (Fe) stand out as promising candidates for the intercalant ions and redox centers, respectively. Recently, weberite-type sodium metal fluorides (Na2\n M\n 2+\n Mʹ\n 3+F7) have emerged as potential high performance Na cathode materials1-4 with predicted energy densities in the 600 to 800 Wh/kg range (higher than any known Na cathode material) and high ionic conductivity and structural stability. One of the few weberites that has been electrochemically tested so far is Na2Fe2F7 and while one study has shown it to have great, high-rate performance,2 there have been inconsistent reports regarding the structure and electrochemical properties of Na2Fe2F7.\n In this study, we endeavor to reconcile these characteristics using a combined experimental-computational approach. Density functional theory calculations reveal the inherent metastability of the weberite phase and the close energetics of several Na2Fe2F7 polymorphic forms, as well as the predicted (de)intercalation behavior for each Na2Fe2F7 polymorph. Experimentally, we find that Na2Fe2F7 samples inevitably contain a mixture of weberite polymorphs as characterized using a broad suite of long-range and local probes sensitive to both amorphous and crystalline phases. Notably, we present the first ever 23Na nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) investigation into weberites and showcase NMR’s ability to parse out different local environments despite the presence of polymorphism. Electrochemically, our Na2Fe2F7 material shows respectable early capacities yet exhibits steady capacity fade, which ex situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and 23Na NMR reveal to be associated with transformation of the weberite phase upon cycling. However, fine tuning of electrode composition and design appears to be effective at reducing this effect.\n Overall, this study presents an in-depth characterization of Na2Fe2F7 and provides key insights that pave the way to unlocking weberites as high energy density Na-ion cathode materials.\n This work made use of the shared facilities of the UC Santa Barbara MRSEC (DMR 1720256) and Center for Scientific Computing (CNS 1725797, DMR 1720256).

        "abstract": "Batteries are easy to use, remotely monitorable, not fuel dependent, easily permitted and installed, and start automatically and reliably during an electrical outage. This makes them optimal for stationary storage and power assurance applications. Within battery-based grid storage, as of mid-2017, lithium-ion, sodium-ion, and lead-acid systems are the leaders, comprising 59% (~1.1 GW), 8% (0.15 GW), and 3% (0.06 GW) of global operational electrochemical storage, respectively.1 However, these batteries suffer from low energy density, high cost, poor safety, environmental concerns, and/or cycle life. Existing battery options on the market also do not meet the required market needs for long-duration backup power. For example, lead-acid batteries require too much space, are heavy, and contain toxic materials. Lithium-ion batteries, while compact and capable of excellent cycle life, are too expensive to serve long outages and have notable flammability and environmental risks.\n Alkaline Zn batteries are a strong candidate for electrical grid storage applications due to Zn’s high capacity (820 mAh/g), established materials supply chain and low cost. To realize the highest energy dense batteries, Zn needs to be coupled with a similarly low cost, abundant and high-capacity cathode. CuO (674 mAh/g) is an intriguing high-capacity cathode when paired with Zn in alkaline electrolyte, a battery that until recently has been relegated to the history books as a primary system. In 2021 Schorr et al. reported a rechargeable Zn/CuO battery that utilized a Bi additive to help facilitate the electrochemical reversibility of the Cu conversion electrode. Bi2O3, a species with comparable redox potentials to Cu2O, promoted reversibility and minimized passivation in the historically non-reversible system. The battery cycled without any observable Cu and Bi mixed oxide phases, cycling between metallic Cu and Bi and Cu2O/Cu(OH)2 and Bi2O3, respectively. Although the Bi additive did not eliminate capacity fade completely, limiting the cells to a 30% depth of discharge (relative to CuO) enabled 250 cycles at > 124 Wh/L. Alternatively, compensating for capacity loss with additional Cu metal provided for very high areal capacities (∼40 mA h/cm2) and energy densities (∼260 W h/L), despite only 65% active material cathode loadings and ∼10% Zn anode utilization; however, preliminary tests indicated these batteries were prone to shorting.\n Seeking to improve performance and minimize the spatial segregation of Cu- and Bi-phases observed upon cycling in the prior system, D. Arnot et al. prepared nanoscale carbon coated (Cu/Bi) particles, where the coating partially minimized dissolution and diffusion of soluble cuprate and bismuthate complexes, where ~ 200 cycles at 300 mAh/g was demonstrated (@ ~ 100 Wh/L). CuBi2O4 and CuO phases were formed upon oxidation, indicating carbon coatings can affect the battery cycling mechanism and may have future roles increasing performance.\n Data collected from a variety of experimental techniques, including cyclic voltammetry, rotating ring-disk electrode voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, operando energy-dispersive X-ray diffraction measurements, battery cycling along with recent DFT modeling will be presented to help elucidate the role of additives, carbon coatings, and ion selective polymers in enabling reversible Zn/Cu based batteries. In addition, the general challenges of achieving a highly reversible energy dense battery based on two conversion electrodes operating in highly alkaline environment will be discussed.\n A near-term goal is to demonstrate a Zn/CuO battery with long lifetime, at appreciable energy densities (> 200 Wh/L), with excellent safety, lower toxicity and sufficiently low cost to be manufactured and installed on the grid. While the laboratory scale Zn/CuO battery builds have very promising characteristics to date they have not been optimized or adapted for consumer or market-based needs in terms of power performance, energy density, cycle life or stability in terms of shelf life and the ability to tolerate partial state of charge. Progress towards these goals may also be discussed.\n This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Electricity, and the Laboratory Directed Research and Development program at Sandia National Laboratories.

        "abstract": "Na-ion cathode materials cycling at high voltages with long cycling life and high capacity are of imminent need for developing future high-energy Na-ion batteries. However, the irreversible anionic redox activity of Na-ion layered cathode materials results in structural distortion and poor capacity retention upon cycling. Herein, we develop a facile doping strategy by incorporating copper into the layered cathode material lattice to relieve the irreversible oxygen oxidation at high voltages. On the basis of a comprehensive comparison with the Cu-free material, both the over-oxidation of O2- to trapped molecular O2 and Mn-related Jahn-Teller distortion have been effectively inhibited by restraining both the oxygen activity and participation of Mn4+/Mn3+ redox activity. Not limited to discovering stable cycling behavior at high voltages after Cu substitution, our findings also highlight an effective strategy to stabilize the anionic redox activity and elucidate the stabilization mechanism of Cu substitution, thus paving the way for further improvement of layered oxide cathode materials for high-energy Na-ion batteries.",

        "title": "Understanding and Comparing the Stability of Water- Versus NMP-Based Tin(IV)Sulfide Electrodes Using Post-Mortem Analysis",
        "abstract": "The market for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has experienced a tremendous growth since 1991, when the first LIB was commercialised by Sony, and it is expected to grow even further. The reason for this upward trend is on the one hand the improvement in performance, specifically in energy density and cyclability, and on the other hand the world’s increase in energy demand. LIBs are now able to power not only small electronic devices but also electric vehicles and stationary energy storage systems.\n In addition to the increased need for batteries with high energy densities, environmental aspects must also be considered. Firstly, commercial LIBs contain critical raw materials (CRM) such as Li, Co, and graphite which are often concentrated in a few areas of the world and are sometimes mined using techniques which exploit both humans and the planet. Secondly, the use of toxic chemicals such as N-methyl-2-pyrollidone (NMP) in electrode manufacturing raises concerns on the degree of sustainability of the product. Furthermore, in order to reduce the CO2 emissions and achieve climate-neutrality by 2050, the EU (BATT4EU) has set goals regarding energy densities, battery life time and safety. Desired values for gravimetric and volumetric energy densities for Generation 3 LIBs are considered 350-400 Wh/kg and 750-1000 Wh/l respectively for 2000+ cycles. These energy values can be achieved by either developing cathodes with higher voltage and/or by developing cathodes and anodes with higher specific capacity. The latter approach together with sustainability aspects are addressed in this work. Tin(IV)sulfide (SnS2) has been investigated in the last few years as one of the most promising anode materials for Li-ion batteries due to its high theoretical specific capacity of 1209 mAhg-1 compared to commonly used graphite (372 mAhg-1). However, its theoretical reversible capacity is 644 mAhg-1 due to the conversion of SnS2 to Li2S and Sn in the first discharge. Furthermore, SnS2 can be processed using water as a solvent in place of previously mentioned NMP. This way, not only the electrochemical performance, but also the environmental friendliness, as well as costs during fabrication can be improved.\n This study focusses on the optimization of water-based slurry processing using SnS2 as active material, and water-soluble binders such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose (Na-CMC) and styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) in comparison to NMP-based electrodes using Polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) as a binding agent.\n In this work, four different electrode compositions were investigated, namely SnS2/C45/CMC:SBR(1:1) in a 90/5/5 ratio and a 80/10/10 ratio, as well as a comparative system consisting of SnS2/C45/PVDF in the same ratios as the previous electrode. All electrode compositions showed an initial specific capacity of ~550 mAh/g, however the cycling stability was in the order of H2O-80:10:10 > H2O-90:5:5 > NMP-80:10:10 > NMP-90:5:5 (Figure 1), with the best water-based electrodes reaching 80% state-of-health (SoH) after 200 cycles.\n In order to understand the degradation mechanisms occurring during cycling and to elucidate the impact of H2O- and NMP-based processing on electrochemical performance, techniques such as Raman, SEM, XRD, XPS, and EIS were performed on pristine electrodes, on electrodes after first discharge (formation cycle), as well as on samples at 80% SoH. Furthermore, in-situ dilatometry was conducted to measure the linear change in length of the electrodes in the direction perpendicular to the electrode surface during cycling. Changes in crystal structure, morphology, surface chemistry (i.e. SEI formation), interface and charge transfer resistance, and volume expansion were correlated with the electrochemical performance.\n (Attached: Figure 1: Comparative graph of galvanostatic cycling with potential limitation (GCPL) of water- and NMP-based electrodes with varying ratios of active material/conductive agent/binder showing the development of capacity and coulombic efficiency as a function of cycle number)\n \n \n \n \n \n Figure 1\n",

Herein, a universal source‐template method is reported to synthesize a variety of transition metal (e.g., V, Sb, W, Zn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) selenides implanting on N doped 3D carbon nanoarchitecture hybrids (MmSen@3D‐CN) with powerful SeC bonding rivet. Benefiting from the superior architecture and potent SeC bonding between Cu2−xSe and N‐doped 3D carbon (3D‐CN), the Cu2−xSe@3D‐CN nanohybrids, as anode of SIBs, show high capacity, high‐rate capability, and long‐cycle durability, which can deliver a reversible capacity of as high as 386 mAh g−1, retain 219 mAh g−1 even at 10 A g−1, and run durably over thousands of charging–discharging cycles. The Cu2−xSe@3D‐CN as anode is also evaluated by developing a full SIB by coupling with the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, which can deliver high energy density and show excellent stability, shedding light on its potential in practical application.",

        "abstract": "A detailed study of the intercalation/de‐intercalation mechanisms of PF6‐ anions in a graphite cathode of sodium dual‐ion batteries is carried out by cyclic voltammetry. The influence of the continuous anion intercalation/de‐intercalation on the graphite structure is investigated by ex‐situ XRD after cycling. It was concluded that the intercalation/de‐intercalation occurs through a combination of diffusion‐controlled and pseudocapacitive mechanisms. Initially, the contribution of the diffusion‐controlled is significant, specifically at the highest voltage and at the lowest scan rates which agrees with the slow kinetic of this mechanism and its usual prevalence in carbon materials with a graphitic structure. However, the continuous anion intercalation/de‐intercalation causes some deterioration of the graphite structural order, even from the initial cycles, as it was demonstrated by the evolution of the crystalline parameters, interlayer spacing, d002, and crystallite size, Lc. This deterioration hinders the diffusion‐controlled anion intercalation/de‐intercalation and, as a consequence, the pseudocapacitive becomes the main mechanism along cycling. Therefore, since graphite is capable of intercalating PF6‐ anions at high voltages through a capacitive mechanism, with its consequent rapid kinetics, this carbon material is an excellent candidate for using as cathode in high power sodium dual‐ion batteries, in which, kinetically fast mechanisms are required.",

        "abstract": "Lacking strategies to simultaneously address the narrow interlayer spacing, irreversible phase transitions, dissolution and electrical transport issues of vanadium oxides is restricting their application in aqueous zinc‐ion batteries. Herein, to address these challenges concurrently, an organic‐inorganic hybrid cathode is explored, HNaV6O16·4H2O‐Glu (HNVO‐Glu), through a guest material‐mediated NVO synthesis strategy utilizing glutamic acid (Glu) to induce Na substituted by proton and enable crystal transformation of Na2V6O16·3H2O (NVO). Specially, Glu insertion kills three birds with one arrow: i) induces the formation of a structurally stable monoclinic HNaV6O16·4H2O phase by introducing H into the NVO framework, preventing structural phase change and collapse of NVO material; ii) acts as a pillar to expand the interlayer spacing, which improves the Zn2+ diffusion kinetics; moreover, the polar groups on the Glu surface weaken the electrostatic interaction between Zn2+ and the host materials, further enhancing the zinc‐ionic transport rate; iii) enhances the electrical conductivity of HNVO by converting the p‐type semiconductor into the n‐type semiconductor structure. Consequently, the HNVO‐Glu exhibits a high specific capacity (354.6 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1), excellent Zn2+ diffusion capability (10−9 to 10−7 cm2 s−1) and outstanding cycling stability with a capacity retention of 87.2% after 12 000 cycles at 10 A g−1.",

Energy and power requirements for these applications need to be satisfied. Besides material improvement, electrode microstructure plays a critical role. Here, the influence of hard carbon (HC) particle size and mass loading on the rate performance have been investigated. This work measured the relative contribution of ionic resistance within the porous electrode (Rion) in SIB full cells employing relevant mass loadings. Rion was obtained by applying electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to symmetrical cells and by fitting a transmission line model under “blocking” conditions. The relative contribution of Rion arising from HC electrodes was further compared to the charge transfer resistance (RCT) in full cell configuration utilising a three-electrode cell under “non-blocking” conditions. Results illustrate mass loading as far more influential on cell rate performance compared to the two particle sizes tested. The three-electrode study reveals the contribution of Rion to be greater than that of RCT at high mass loadings and high states of charge for the HC electrode and elucidated that the gravimetric and volumetric discharge capacity of cells is limited by the layered oxide cathode and HC electrode, respectively.",

The thermodynamically favorable solid solution pathway rewards the SIBs with excellent cycling stability (87.2% capacity retention after 500 cycles) and rate performance (100.5 mA h g-1 at 2500 mA g-1).

        "title": "Single-atom catalysts based on C2N for sulfur cathodes in Na-S batteries: a first-principles study.",
        "abstract": "Several major roadblocks, including the \"shuttle effect\" caused by the dissolved higher-order sodium polysulfides (NaPSs), extremely poor conductivity of sulfur cathodes, and sluggish conversion kinetics of charging-discharging reactions, have hindered the commercialization of sodium-sulfur batteries (NaSBs). In our study, representative C2N-based single-atom catalysts (SACs), TM@C2N (TM = Fe, Ni and V), are proposed to improve the comprehensive performance of NaSBs. Based on first-principles calculations, we first discuss in detail the anchoring behavior of all adsorption systems, TM@C2N/(S8 and NaPSs). The results indicate that compared to pristine C2N, TM@C2N substrates exhibit a stronger capability to capture S8/NaPSs clusters through physical/chemical binding, with V@C2N showing the most outstanding capability ranging from -2.37 to -5.03 eV. The density of states analysis reveals that metallic properties can be well maintained before and after adsorption of polysulfides. More importantly, TM@C2N configurations can greatly reduce the energy barriers of charging and discharging reactions, thereby accelerating the conversion efficiency of NaSBs. It is worth mentioning that V@C2N has lower charge-discharge energy barriers and Na ion migration rates, since the embedded TM atom weakens the strong binding of Na+ in the N6 cavity of C2N. The intrinsic mechanism analysis reveals that the interaction between the d orbitals of V and the p orbitals of S leads to the weakening of Na-S bonds, which can not only effectively inhibit the shuttle effect, but also promote the dissociation of Na2S. Overall, this work not only offers excellent catalytic materials, but also provides vital guidance for designing SACs in NaSBs.",

A critical component for ASSSB is sodium-ion conducting solid-state electrolyte (SSE). Here, we report a high-performance sodium-ion SSE with the recently developed bulk interfacial superionic conductor (BISC) concept. The ionic conductivity and areal conductance of the Na+ BISC at 25 °C reaches 6.5 × 10-4 S cm-1 and 260 mS cm-2, respectively. Using NaxCo0.7Mn0.3O2 (x ≈ 1.0, NaCMO) as the cathode active material, all-solid-state Na||NaCMO batteries exhibiting small overpotential and ∼180 cycle life are demonstrated under room temperature. This approach may also be used to prepare other metal ion, such as Mg2+, Al3+, and K+, based all-solid-state batteries.",

However, the synthesis of TiO2 nanoarrays often requires highly toxic or corrosive solution circumstances. Meanwhile, the case that most TiO2 nanoarrays are grown on rigid conductive substrate can’t satisfy the demand for application in the space of complex shape. In this work, we developed a simple method to prepare highly ordered single crystalline rutile TiO2 nanorod arrays with high density on flexible metal Ti substrate in relatively weak acid solution, and the orientation of the nanorods were more uniform than those by other means ever before. Based on detailed analysis, an ion-assisted and concentration-limited epitaxial growth mechanism by H+ and SO42− is proposed for this uniformly ordered rutile TiO2 nanorod array. This work can promote the research and application of flexible solar cells and lithium-ion batteries, especially their integration.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion battery has been considered as one of the most promising power sources for large‐scale energy storage systems due to its similar electrochemistry to the lithium‐ion battery and the crust abundance of Na resources. Essentially, developing low‐cost electrode materials along with a facile and economical synthesis procedure is critically important to promote the commercialization of sodium‐ion batteries. However, applicable cathode materials capable of being massively produced are still scarcely reported to date. Herein, a green and scalable synthesis approach is developed to obtain Na3Fe2(PO4)P2O7 (NFPP)/rGO composite by using FePO4 and Na3PO4 as the resources, during which all the atoms present in the starting materials end up in the product. The prepared Na3Fe2(PO4)P2O7/rGO cathode exhibits an ultralong cycle life (capacity retention of 72.4% after 8000 cycles at 20 C) and outstanding rate capability (42.4 mAh g−1 at 100 C). In particular, the NFPP/rGO‐HC full battery assembled by the Na3Fe2(PO4)P2O7/rGO cathode and hard carbon anode demonstrates an energy density of 192 Wh kg−1 and superior cycling performance (capacity retention of 85.2% after 500 cycles).

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage systems due to the abundance and low price of sodium. Until recently, the low theoretical capacities of intercalation-type cathodes less than 250 mAh g-1 have limited the energy density of SIBs. On the other hand, iron oxyfluoride (FeOF) has a high theoretical capacity of ≈885 mAh g-1 as a conversion-type cathode material for SIBs. However, FeOF suffers from poor cycling stability, rate capability, and low initial Coulombic efficiency caused by its low electrical conductivity and slow ionic diffusion kinetics. To solve these problems, doping aliovalent Ni2+ on FeOF electrodes is attempted to improve the electronic conductivity without using a carbon matrix. The ionic conductivity of FeOF is also enhanced due to the formation of oxygen defects in the FeOF crystal structure. The FeOF-Ni1 electrode shows an excellent cycling performance with a reversible discharge capacity of 450.4 mAh g-1 at 100 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles with a fading rate of 0.20% per cycle. In addition, the FeOF-Ni1//hard carbon full cell exhibited a high energy density of 876.9 Wh kg-1 cathode with a good cycling stability.",

        "abstract": "Ultrafast-charging is the focus of next-generation rechargeable batteries for widespread economic success by reducing the time cost. However, the poor ion diffusion rate, intrinsic electronic conductivity and structural stability of cathode materials seriously hinder the development of ultrafast-charging technology. To overcome these challenges, an interfacial dynamics and thermodynamics synergistic strategy is proposed to synchronously enhance the fast-charging capability and structural stability of polyanion cathode materials. As a case study, a Na3V2(PO4)3 composite (NVP/NSC) is successfully obtained by introducing an interface layer derived from N/S co-doped carbon dots. Density functional theory calculations validate that the interfacial bonding effect of V–N/S–C significantly reduces the Na+ transport energy barrier. D-band center theory analysis confirms the downward shift of the V d-band center enhances the strength of the V–O bond and considerably inhibits irreversible phase transformation. Benefitting from this interfacial synergistic strategy, NVP/NSC achieves a high capability and excellent cycling stability with a surprisingly low carbon content (2.23%) at an extremely high rate of 100C for 10 000 cycles (87.2 mA h g−1, 0.0028% capacity decay per cycle). Furthermore, a superior performance at 5C (115.3 mA h g−1, 92.1% capacity retention after 800 cycles) is exhibited by the NVP/NSC‖HC full cell. These findings provide timely new insights for the systematic design of ultrafast-charging cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "The energy storage needs of the 21st century demand solutions that are both 'efficient' and 'sustainable.' The research explores alternatives to transition metal-based electrode materials traditionally used in LIBs, with a particular focus on redox-active organic materials, such as ample availability of precursors, structural diversity, non-toxicity, and low cost.[1] Conductive polymers, organosulfur compounds, organic radicals, small carbonyl compounds, carbonyl polymers, imine and azo compounds are the few classes of organics explored. This study focuses on the development of rechargeable batteries using earth-abundant elements, with a specific emphasis on organic redox polymers for Li-ion batteries (LIBs).[2]\n \n The investigation focuses on poly(3-vinyl-N-methylphenothiazine) (PVMPT), a p-type material, showcasing its excellent rate capability, cyclic stability, and reasonable theoretical capacity (112 mAh g−1). Despite the promising electrochemical performance of PVMPT, the electrode processing methods involve the use of toxic and flammable solvents, such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), and expensive binders like polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF).[3] To address these challenges, this study proposes the use of green solvents (Cyrene, Ƴ-valerolactone, and Dimethyl sulfoxide) for electrode processing, eliminating the need for toxic solvents and promoting the sustainability and safety of organic materials.[4] A shift to sustainable aqueous binders, such as carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), sodium alginate (SA), and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR),[5] is explored (Figure 1a-c), with the CMC system showing superior capacity retention.\n Additionally, the study delves into the Phenoxazine class of redoxomers, particularly polyvinylphenoxazine (PVMPO), a fast-charging cathode with a theoretical capacity of 120mAh g−1.[6] Challenges related to the dissolution of the oxidized state in the carbonate electrolyte are addressed by employing highly porous conductive additives and exploring different electrolyte compositions. A shift from toxic PVDF/NMP binder systems to aqueous binders (CMC, SBR, SA) is implemented, with the CMC-based electrodes demonstrating superior adhesion even after 10,000 cycles at 1C rate (Figure 1d-f).\n To conclude, the study believes that the strategic selection of conductive additives and electrolytes, coupled with the use of green solvents and aqueous binders, will contribute to the development of eco-friendly and sustainable energy storage systems. The comprehensive performance evaluation of the proposed systems is presented in detail, utilizing various characterization tools such as XRD, FT-IR, UV-VIS, and SEM.\n References \n \n Lee et al., Adv Mater., 2018, 42,1704682.\n \n \n Dühnen et al., Small Methods, 2020, 4, 2000039.\n \n \n Kolek et al., Energy Environ.

        "abstract": "The ever-increasing demand for large-scale energy storage has driven the prosperous investigation of sodium-ion batteries (NIBs). As a promising cathode candidate for NIBs, P2-type Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 (NaNMO), a prototype sodium layered oxide, has attracted extensive attention because of its high operating voltage and high capacity density. Although its electrochemical properties have been extensively investigated, the fundamental charge compensation mechanism, i.e., the cationic and anionic redox reactions, is still elusive. In this report, we have systematically investigated the transition metal and oxygen redox reactions of NaNMO nanoflakes using bulk-sensitive soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS) and full-range mapping of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (mRIXS) from an atomic-level view. We show that the bulk Mn3+/Mn4+ redox couple emerges from the first discharge process with the increment of inactive Mn3+ upon cycling, which may have a negative effect on the cyclability. In contrast, the bulk Ni redox mainly stems from the Ni2+/Ni3+ redox couple, in contrast to the conventional wisdom of the Ni2+/Ni4+ redox couple. The quantitative analysis provides unambiguous evidence for the continuous reduction of the average valence state of Mn and Ni over extended cycles, leading to the voltage fading. In addition, we reveal that the oxygen anions also participate in the charge compensation process mainly through irreversible oxygen release rather than reversible lattice oxygen redox. Such understanding is vital for the precise design and optimization of NaNMO electrodes for rechargeable NIBs with outstanding performance.",

However, whether it is a base station power source, an energy storage power station, or a start-stop power supply, long energy cycle life (more than 5000 cycles), high stability, and safety performance are application prerequisites. Regrettably, currently, few sodium-ion batteries can meet this requirement, mainly due to shortcomings in positive electrode performance. We report a sufficiently stable sodium-ion battery cathode material, Na2Fe0.95P2O7, that retains 97.5% capacity after 5000 charge/discharge cycles. The use of nonstoichiometry in the lattice enables simultaneous modification of the crystal and electronic structure, promoting Na2Fe0.95P2O7 to be extremely stable while still being able to achieve a capacity of 92 mAh g-1 and stable cycling at high temperatures up to 60 °C. Our results confirm the positive effect of nonstoichiometric ratios on the performance of Na2Fe0.95P2O7 and provide a reliable idea to promote the practical application of sodium-ion batteries.",

Here, we present a detailed study of NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 powders stored in different atmospheres (oxygen, argon, and carbon dioxide), either dry or wet. X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared measurements were used to characterize the materials and their surface species before and after controlled-atmosphere storage. It was determined that the exposure of untreated NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 powders to moisture results in desodiation and material degradation, leading to poor cycling. This effect was found to be caused by reactive surface species. From these results, a simple ethanol washing method was found to significantly reduce the air-reactivity and improve the electrochemical performance of NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 by removing surface impurities formed by air exposure.",

        "abstract": "NASICON (sodium superionic conductor) materials are promising host compounds for the reversible capture of Na+ ions, finding prior application in batteries as solid-state electrolytes and cathodes/anodes. Given their affinity for Na+ ions, these materials can be used in Faradaic deionization (FDI) for the selective removal of sodium over other competing ions. Here, we investigate the selective removal of sodium over other alkali and alkaline-earth metal cations from aqueous electrolytes when using a NASICON-based mixed Ti-V phase as an intercalation electrode, namely, sodium titanium vanadium phosphate (NTVP). Galvanostatic cycling experiments in three-electrode cells with electrolytes containing Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Li+ reveal that only Na+ and Li+ can intercalate into the NTVP crystal structure, while other cations show capacitive response, leading to a material-intrinsic selectivity factor of 56 for Na+ over K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+. Furthermore, electrochemical titration experiments together with modeling show that an intercalation mechanism with a limited miscibility gap for Na+ in NTVP mitigates the state-of-charge gradients to which phase-separating intercalation electrodes are prone when operated under electrolyte flow. NTVP electrodes are then incorporated into an FDI cell with automated fluid recirculation to demonstrate up to 94% removal of sodium in streams with competing alkali/alkaline-earth cations with 10-fold higher concentration, showing process selectivity factors of 3-6 for Na+ over cations other than Li+. Decreasing the current density can improve selectivity up to 25% and reduce energy consumption by as much as ∼50%, depending on the competing ion. The results also indicate the utility of NTVP for selective lithium recovery.",

However, one significant drawback of organic electrode materials is their tendency to dissolve in the electrolyte. Resazurin sodium salt (RSS) has demonstrated remarkable charge/discharge performance characterized by a voltage plateau and high capacity when utilized as a cathode in aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs). Unfortunately, the solubility of RSS as a sodium salt continues to pose challenges in AZIBs. In this study, we introduce an RSS-containing organic compound, triresazurin-triazine (TRT), with a porous structure prepared by a desalinization method from the RSS and 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine (TCT). This process retained active groups (carbonyl and nitroxide radical) while generating a highly conjugated structure, which not only inhibits the dissolution in the electrolyte, but also improves the electrical conductivity, enabling TRT to have excellent electrochemical properties. When evaluated as a cathode for AZIBs, TRT exhibits a high reversible capacity of 180 mA h g−1, exceptional rate performance (78 mA h g−1 under 2 A g−1), and excellent cycling stability with 65 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1 after 1000 cycles.",

However, the development of an HCF cathode with high cycling stability and voltage retention is still impeded by the unavoidable Fe(CN)6 vacancies (VFeCN) and H2O in the materials. Here, a repair method is proposed that significantly reduces the VFeCN content in potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate (KMHCF) enabled by the reducibility of sodium citrate and removal of ligand H2O at high temperature (KMHCF‐H). The KMHCF‐H obtained at 90 °C contains only 2% VFeCN, and the VFeCN is concentrated in the lattice interior. Such an integrated Fe–CN–Mn surface structure of the KMHCF‐H cathode with repaired surface VFeCN allows preferential decomposition of potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (KFSI) in the electrolyte, which constitutes a dense anion‐dominated cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) , inhibiting effectively Mn dissolution into the electrolyte. Consequently, the KMHCF‐H cathode exhibits excellent cycling performance for both half‐cell (95.2 % at 0.2 Ag−1 after 2000 cycles) and full‐cell (99.4 % at 0.1 Ag−1 after 200 cycles). This thermal repair method enables scalable preparation of KMHCF with a low content of vacancies, holding substantial promise for practical applications of PIBs.",

However, the concomitant inorganic salt is usually recognized as impurities and plays an obscure and even contradictory effect on the regulation of pore structure in HCs. Herein, a two-step pyrolysis procedure to the representative salty coal is performed, in which the acid washing program is selectively inserted. It is illuminated that salt acts as a template or activating agent for the generation of open pores at low temperatures but inhibits the closure of pores during the following high-temperature carbonization. The optimized HC delivers a reversible capacity of 322.4 mAh g-1, a high plateau capacity of 192 mAh g-1, and an initial coulombic efficiency of 80%, outperforming to most coal-based HCs. Assembled with an NVPOF cathode, the full-cell exhibits a high energy density of 284.7 Wh kg-1.

        "abstract": "To meet the increasing demands of energy storage, particularly for transportation applications such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, researchers will need to develop improved lithium-ion battery electrode materials that exhibit high energy density, high power, better safety, and longer cycle life. The acceleration of materials discovery, synthesis, and optimization will benefit from the combination of both experimental and computational methods. First principles (ab Initio) computational methods have been widely used in materials science and can play an important role in accelerating the development and optimization of new energy storage materials. These methods can prescreen previously unknown compounds and can explain complex phenomena observed with these compounds. Intercalation compounds, where Li(+) ions insert into the host structure without causing significant rearrangement of the original structure, have served as the workhorse for lithium ion rechargeable battery electrodes. Intercalation compounds will also facilitate the development of new battery chemistries such as sodium-ion batteries. During the electrochemical discharge reaction process, the intercalating species travel from the negative to the positive electrode, driving the transition metal ion in the positive electrode to a lower oxidation state, which delivers useful current. Many materials properties change as a function of the intercalating species concentrations (at different state of charge). Therefore, researchers will need to understand and control these dynamic changes to optimize the electrochemical performance of the cell. In this Account, we focus on first-principles computational investigations toward understanding, controlling, and improving the intrinsic properties of five well known high energy density Li intercalation electrode materials: layered oxides (LiMO2), spinel oxides (LiM2O4), olivine phosphates (LiMPO4), silicates-Li2MSiO4, and the tavorite-LiM(XO4)F (M = 3d transition metal elements). For these five classes of materials, we describe the crystal structures, the redox potentials, the ion mobilities, the possible phase transformation mechanisms, and structural stability changes, and the relevance of these properties to the development of high-energy, high-power, low-cost electrochemical systems. These results demonstrate the importance of computational tools in real-world materials development, to optimize or minimize experimental synthesis and testing, and to predict a material's performance under diverse conditions.",

Our findings demonstrate that rGO sheets improve cycling performance in NFP/C/rGO composite in the absence of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)-stabilizing additives. However, once SEI is stabilized with the help of fluoroethylene carbonate electrolyte additive, NFP with carbon additive (NFP/C) exhibits a superior electrochemical performance when compared to NFP/rGO and NFP/C/rGO composites. The decreases in capacity and rate capability are proportional to the amount of rGO added, and lead to an increase in overvoltage and internal resistance. Based on our results, we attribute this effect to worsened sodium kinetics in the bulk of the electrode—the larger ionic radius of Na+ hinders charge transfer in the presence of rGO, despite the likely improved electronic conductivity. These findings provide a compelling explanation for the observed trends in electrochemical performance and suggest that the use of rGO in Na-ion battery electrodes may present challenges associated with ionic transport along and through rGO sheets.",

The cell is capable of high-rate long-term cycling, which retains 84% of the capacity after five hundred cycles at alternate 20 and 5C. Therefore, this work not only demonstrates a novel high-performance anode material for ARSBs, but also introduces a general applicable and highly efficient architecture of aligned 1D nanofibers for energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion capacitors (SICs) have shown great potential to combine the merits of high-power capability of traditional capacitor and high energy capability of the battery. However, the sluggish kinetics and inferior stability of conventional sodium-ion storage anode materials are major challenges for the practical utilization of SICs. In this work, interconnected urchin-like hollow Na2Ti3O7 (Na2Ti3O7-IcUH) chains were designed and prepared by a simple one step template-assisting method. Through a variety of controlled experiments, we explored how to effectively engineer the crystal-oriented growth and string the urchin-like spheres together. Benefiting from its urchin-like hollow structure and fully exposed (001) facet, the resulting Na2Ti3O7-IcUH exhibits a superior rate capability of 96.2 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1. Meanwhile, the interconnected three-dimensional (3D) primary structure endows Na2Ti3O7-IcUH with excellent cyclic stability (15% capacity loss at 5 A g-1 after 2000 cycles).

        "abstract": "O3-type layered oxide cathode exhibits great application potential for practical sodium-ion batteries, due to its cost-effectiveness, abundant sodium and manganese resources, and high theoretical capacity. However, the irreversible phase transition, coupled with rapid capacity decay, which is primarily attributed to the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn3+, remains a significant bottleneck for commercial application. Additionally, the sluggish kinetics during the (de)sodiation process require urgent improvement. Herein, an electronic structure regulation strategy is proposed by low-valence Li/Cu co-substitution to address these issues. The roles of Li/Cu on the electronic structure, structural evolution, and electrochemical properties in the Na0.96Ni0.22Fe0.2Mn0.5Li0.04Cu0.04O2 (NFMLC) cathode are comprehensively explored through systematic in situ/ex situ characterization techniques and theoretical calculations. The results reveal that this strategy effectively activates more Ni2+/3+ and Fe3+/4+ redox reactions above 2.5 V, while suppressing Mn3+/4+ redox activity below 2.5 V, thereby achieving highly structural reversibility. Therefore, the NFMLC electrode displays excellent long-term cycling stability (81.5% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 5 C), and significantly enhanced rate performance (from 45.5% to 80.4% under a ratio of 5 C to 0.5 C).

In this work, we aim to form thin films of sodium manganese oxide (NMO) cathode materials for NIBs using atomic layer deposition (ALD) with the vision to isolate and study these interfacial processes in the absence of bulk NMO. We combine established chemistries for ALD of manganese oxide (MnOx) using Mn(thd)3/O3 and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) using NaOtBu/H2O and adjust the sequence and ratios of these two chemistries to form NaxMnyO alloy films. We identify that increasing the O3 exposure during Mn(thd)3/O3 ALD beyond previously reported values increases the growth rate of MnOx from 0.23 to 0.62 Å per cycle and provides improved uniformity, yielding predominantly Mn5O8. Furthermore, alloying Mn(thd)3/O3 with NaOtBu/H2O mutually enhances the growth rate of both ALD chemistries, yielding a growth rate of ∼9 Å per supercycle for a 1 : 1 cycle ratio. This enhancement in growth arises from sub-surface reactions, including the reaction of NaOtBu to a depth of ∼1.3 nm into bulk MnOx to form Na2MnOx. By tuning cycle ratios and growth conditions, we demonstrate control over the NaxMnyO composition and measure different electrochemical properties depending on the composition. The formation of NMO thin films with controlled thickness and composition established in this work provides a means to systematically study interfacial processes occurring in NMO cathode materials for NIBs.",

More precisely, the forming process of the pores in NVP could be easily controlled by utilizing the huge difference in critical micelle concentration of a surfactant (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, CTAB) in water and ethanol. By reasonably modulating the ratio of water and ethanol in the solution, the as-synthesized NVP/C sample exhibited a three-dimensional interconnected structure with hierarchical micro/meso/macro-pores. Benefiting from these hierarchical porous structures in NVP/C, the structural stability, contact surface with the electrolyte, and electronic/ionic conductivity were improved simultaneously; whereby the optimized porous NVP/C sample exhibited an excellent high-rate performance (61.3 mA h g-1 at 10 C) and superior cycling stability (90.2% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 10 C).",

This study presents NASICON‐based electrolyte, achieving a remarkable conductivity of 6.0 × 10⁻3 S cm⁻1 at room temperature, rivaling that of sulfide‐based electrolytes. This is accomplished by optimizing the composition in the range Na3+x+yZr2−yAlySi2+xP1−xO12 (0.10 ≤ x ≤ 0.50, 0 ≤ y ≤ 0.1). Despite the issue of reduced sinterability with increasing Si/P ratio due to the formation of a viscous SiO2‐rich grain boundary interphase, the addition of Al2O3 effectively reduces the viscosity and improves the sinterability. In other words, a strategy of engineering the liquid phase that is in situ generated from the host phase is viable. The enhanced conductivity is attributed not only to the lowered grain boundary resistivity but also to lattice expansion from modified Na occupations in the crystal structure. Furthermore, this material demonstrates a wide electrochemical window, suppressed partial electronic conductivity, low polarization voltage in direct contact with a Na anode, and charge‐discharge cycles with minimal polarization when directly interfaced with a NASICON‐type cathode, repositioning it as a promising electrolyte for ceramic ASSBs.",

        "abstract": "As one of the most promising candidates for all-solid-state sodium-ion batteries and sodium-metal batteries, polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) and amorphous hexafluoropropylene (HFP) copolymerized polymer solid electrolytes still suffer from a relatively low room temperature ionic conductivity. To modify the properties of PVDF-HEP copolymer electrolytes, we introduce the graphitic C3N4 (g−C3N4) nanosheets as a novel nanofiller to form g−C3N4 composite solid polymer electrolytes (CSPEs). The analysis shows that the g−C3N4 filler can not only modify the structure in g−C3N4CSPEs by reducing the crystallinity, compared to the PVDF−HFP solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs), but also promote a further dissociation with the sodium salt through interaction between the surface atoms of the g−C3N4 and the sodium salt. As a result, enhanced electrical properties such as ionic conductivity, Na+ transference number, mechanical properties and thermal stability of the composite electrolyte can be observed. In particular, a low Na deposition/dissolution overpotential of about 100 mV at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 was found after 160 cycles with the incorporation of g−C3N4. By applying the g−C3N4 CSPEs in the sodium-metal battery with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, the coin cell battery exhibits a lower polarization voltage at 90 mV, and a stable reversible capacity of 93 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at 1 C.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted widespread attention for large‐scale energy storage, but one major drawback, i.e., the limited capacity of cathode materials, impedes their practical applications. Oxygen redox reactions in layered oxide cathodes are proven to contribute additionally high specific capacity, while such cathodes often suffer from irreversible structural transitions, causing serious capacity fading and voltage decay upon cycling, and the formation process of the oxidized oxygen species remains elusive. Herein, a series of Al‐doped P2‐type Na0.6Ni0.3Mn0.7O2 cathode materials for SIBs are reported and the corresponding charge compensation mechanisms are investigated qualitatively and quantitatively. The combined analyses reveal that Al doping boosts the reversible oxygen redox reactions through the reductive coupling reactions between orphaned O 2p states in NaOAl local configurations and Ni4+ ions, as directly evidenced by X‐ray absorption fine structure results. Additionally, Al doping also induces an increased interlayer spacing and inhibits the unfavorable P2 to O2 phase transition upon desodiation/sodiation, which is common in P2‐type Mn‐based cathode materials, leading to the great improvement in capacity retention and rate capability. This work provides deeper insights into the development of structurally stable and high‐capacity layered cathode materials for SIBs with anion–cation synergetic contributions.",

        "abstract": "Self-healing functional materials can repair cracks and damage inside the battery, ensuring the stability of the battery material structure. This feature minimizes performance degradation during the charging and discharging processes, improving the efficiency and stability of the battery. Here, we have developed a novel healing conductive two-dimensional sulfur iodide (SI4) composite cathode. This process integrates both sulfur and iodine compounds into carbon nanocages, forming a SI4@C core-shell structure. This cathode design improves electrical conductivity and repairability, facilitates rapid activation, and ensures structural integrity, resulting in a typical Na-SI4 battery with high capacity and an exceptionally long cycle life. At 10.0 A g-1, the capacity of the Na-SI4 battery can still reach 217.4 mAh g-1 after more than 500 cycles, and the capacity decay rate per cycle is only 0.06%. In addition, the cathode exhibits a cascade redox reaction involving S and I, contributing to its high capacity. The in situ growth of a carbon shell further enhances the conductivity and structural robustness of the entire cathode. The flexibility and bendability of SI4@C-carbon cloth make it applicable for flexible electronic devices, providing more possibilities for battery design. The strategy of engineering a two-dimensional self-healing structure to construct a superior cathode is expected to be widely applied to other electrode materials. This study provides a new pathway for designing novel binary-conversion-type sodium-ion batteries with excellent long-term cycling performance.",

Moreover, ex situ ICP-OES suggests interesting mixed-ions migration processes: In the initial two cycles, only Li(+) can intercalate into the LNCM cathode, whereas both Li(+) and Na(+) work together as the electrochemical cycles increase. Also the structural evolution of LNCM is examined in terms of ex situ XRD pattern at the end of various charge-discharge scans.

        "abstract": "P2-type Mn-based layered oxides have emerged as one of the most promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries owing to their advantages of facile preparation and high theoretical capacity. However, challenges such as phase transition and irreversible oxygen release during cycling often lead to rapid structural distortion and the formation of oxygen vacancies, ultimately resulting in rapid capacity decay. Herein, a covalency modulation strategy is adopted to address these challenges and successfully achieved a stable P2-type Mn-based layered oxide by introducing strong covalent Ni─O bonds. The robust Ni─O motif plays a crucial role in maintaining the rigidity of transition metal (TM) layered frameworks, which efficiently alleviates the structural distortion and degradation of the coordination environments of local TM sites, thereby achieving durable structural stiffness over extended cycles. In addition, the strong covalent Ni─O bonds can also stabilize the local oxygen environment, effectively suppressing the irreversible oxygen release. Benefiting from these advancements, the as-designed Na0.6Mg0.15Mn0.7Ni0.15O2 cathode displays a full solid-solution behavior with a low volume change of only 0.9% and an enhanced reversibility of lattice oxygen redox (OR) reaction. This investigation emphasizes the crucial role of covalency modulation in regulating OR chemistry and structural integrity to achieve high-energy-density Mn-based layered oxides.",

To understand the outstanding performance, the proton-assisted sodium ion storage mechanism and interphase chemistry of VHCF is investigated by solid-state NMR technology. It is suggested that H+ storage reaction is accompanied by the redox of vanadium atoms, and Na+-intercalation is accompanied by the redox of iron atoms. It is also observed that the complex of polyethylene glycol (PEG) with Na+ (PEG-Na+) exists on the VHCF surface which facilitates the stability of VHCF and promotes the alkali ion transfer at a high current density.

In this study, we propose a strategy to enhance the electrochemical properties of P3-type manganese-based layered oxide cathode by introducing a small amount of layered P2 and Li-O'3 phases. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) structural refinement and aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) are performed to confirm the microstructures of different samples. PXRD refinement results show that the elevated annealing temperature leads to a partial conversion of the P3 phase to the P2 phase and the addition of lithium results in the formation of a new O'3 phase in the P3/P2-layered matrix. STEM results identify the intergrowth of P3/P2 and P3/P2/O'3 in biphasic and triphasic materials, respectively. Electron energy loss spectroscopy verifies that the alkali metal layer in the O'3 phase is occupied by the lithium ion. The intergrowth of biphasic and triphasic materials in these layered P3/P2 and P3/P2/O'3 hybrid structures brings forth a positive effect on the electrochemical properties. In particular, the formation of P3/P2/O'3-intergrown hybrid structures greatly improves the cycling stability of the P3 phase that the capacity retention of P3/P2/O'3 hybrid structures remains 78%, while capacity retention of the pure P3 phase is only 54.1% after 50 cycles at a rate of 0.2 C, and the rate performance of the P3 phase has also been enhanced.",

Simply optimizing the electrode materials or designing the electrode components is no longer effective in improving the performance of CMs. Binders, as one of the electrode components, play a vital role in improving the electrochemical performance of batteries. Here we rationally designed FeF2 electrodes for the first time by optimizing electrode materials with the introduction of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and combined with a sodium alginate (SA) binder based on strong interactions. We show that the FeF2@CNTs‐SA cathode does not suffer from TM ion dissolution and delivers a high capacity of 184.7 mAh g−1 at 10 mA g−1. Moreover, the capacity of FeF2@CNTs‐SA is as high as 99.2 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1, which is a twofold increase compared to FeF2@CNTs‐PVDF. After calculating the average capacity decay rate per cycle of them, we find that FeF2@CNTs‐SA is about one‐third lower than FeF2@CNTs‐PVDF. Therefore, the SA binder can be broadly used for electrodes comprising several CMs, providing meaningful insights into mechanisms that lead to their improved electrochemical performances.",

MMT with interlayer alkali cations show appreciable ionic conductivity. Natural Na-MMT found in Sri Lanka was used for the present study. To improve the ionic conductivity of natural Na-MMT, the structure was further saturated with Na + ions. The Na + ion concentration of saturated Na-MMT was measured by Inductive Couple Plasma Mass Spectroscopy. The structural and electrical properties of Na saturated MMT were characterized by SEM and Complex Impedance Spectroscopy. As a result of Na+ ion saturation the bulk conductivity of Na-MMT was increased to 3.41×10 -4 S cm-1 at 30  C . Saturated Na-MMT has negligible electronic conductivity which is less than 0.001%. For using Na-MMT as intercalation cathode materials in rechargeable batteries, an appreciable electronic conductivity must also be present. To enhance the electronic conductivity of saturated Na-MMT, carbon black was mixed. The electronic transference number of saturated Na-MMT pellets was measured by the DC polarization technique. The electronic transference number of saturated Na-MMT with 25% and 30% carbon black were 0.81 and 0.87 respectively.",

        "title": "Electrolyte Salts for Sodium-Ion Batteries: NaPF6 or NaClO4?",
        "abstract": "NaClO4 and NaPF6, the most universally adopted electrolyte salts in commercial sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), have a decisive influence on the interfacial chemistry, which is closely related to electrochemical performance. The complicated and ambiguous interior mechanism of microscopic interfacial chemistry has prevented reaching a consensus regarding the most suitable sodium salt for high-performance SIB electrolytes. Herein, we reveal that the solvation structure induced by different sodium salt anions determines the Na+ desolvation kinetics and interfacial film evolution process. Specifically, the weak interaction between Na+ and PF6- promoted sodium desolvation and storage kinetics. The solvation structure involving PF6- induced the anion's preferential decomposition, generating a thin, inorganic compound-rich cathode-electrolyte interphase that ensured interface stability and inhibited solvent decomposition, thereby guaranteeing electrode stability and promoting the charge transfer kinetics. This study provides clear evidence that NaPF6 is not only more compatible with industrial processes but also more conducive to battery performance. Commercial electrolyte design employing NaPF6 will undoubtedly promote the industrialization of SIBs.",

        "title": "Organic Species-Intercalated Vanadium Oxide for Sodium-Ion Battery: Mixed-Anion Coordination Effect, Enhanced d-p Orbital Hybridization, and Topotactic Phase Conversion Induced by N-Substitution.",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion battery (SIB) is a reasonable alternative to lithium-ion battery (LIB) in the field of grid-scale energy storage systems. Unfortunately, the development of appropriate cathode material is a bottleneck in the field of SIB. In the present work, (p-TQ)-VO, formulated as (p-TQ)0.2V2O5·0.38H2O, was synthesized based on a facile hydrothermal reaction of V2O5 and methylhydroquinone (p-HTQ). And when V2O5 was replaced by VN, (p-TQ)-VN, formulated as (p-TQ)0.22V2(O/N)5, was prepared instead. The (p-TQ)-VO sample displays good electrochemical performance as the SIB cathode. And (p-TQ)-VN shows a much higher capacity at a small current density, and it can maintain structural integrity with partial topotactic phase transformation into NaxV2O5 during the discharge/charge process. A series of characterizations of (p-TQ)-VO and (p-TQ)-VN reveals the successful intercalation of p-TQ into the layered V2O5 with a (001) lattice spacing of 13.7 and 10.7 Å, respectively. In (p-TQ)-VN, partial terminal oxygen (Ot) atoms from the V-O-V layer have been substituted by N atoms, which can boost the orbital hybridization of V 3d and Ot 2p, shorten the V-Ot bonds in the c-axial direction, and elongate the V-O bonds in the ab plane with compressed {VO4N2} octahedra, giving rise to mixed-anion coordination effect. As a result, the enhanced electron densities around the Ot atoms of the V-O-V layer can facilitate the affinity toward the inserted Na+ ions, leading to partial phase conversion into NaNO2/NaNO3. Moreover, density functional density (DFT) calculations reveal that the N-incorporation can improve electron conductivity with richer molecular orbital energy levels, resulting in multistep redox reactions and enhanced capacity.",

        "abstract": "\n Layered transition metal oxides are one of the most promising positive electrode materials for sodium ion batteries. However, the instability of the structure and poor rate performance during the charging-discharging process limit its application. Herein, a high-temperature solid-state reaction and liquid phase coating method is developed to synthesize the P2-type cathode of Na0.85Li0.12Ni0.22Mn0.66O2-1%wt TiO2 (denoted as NLNMO-1%wt TiO2). The layered oxide cathode with TiO2-coating exhibits a superior rate capability, delivers a high reversible capacity of 111.4 mAh g-1 at 1 C with a capacity retention of 94.5 % after 100 cycles, and maintains a capacity of 87.1 mAh g-1 at 5 C with a capacity retention of 81.8 % after 400 cycles. This new strategy reduces the relative content of Mn3+, which suppresses the Jahn-Teller effect and enhances the structural stability. Moreover, it forms a stable CEI film, which reduces the side reactions between cathode surface and the electrolyte, suppressing the pulverization of the electrode, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The results of this work indicate that the composite cathode of NLNMO-1%wt TiO2 has a long cycle life and excellent rate performance for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries.",

        "title": "Synthesis and Thermal Evaporation Deposition of Sodium Oxychloride Solid-State Electrolyte for Sodium-Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have attracted significant attention by offering an alternative option to lithium-ion batteries. Solid-state sodium oxyhalides (Na3OX, X = Cl, Br, I) have the advantage of cost-effective synthesis from raw materials in a time-effective manner. In this study, sodium oxychloride (Na3OCl) antiperovskite was synthesized using a novel approach that allowed for facile synthesis outside of an argon glovebox. The ionic conductivity of Na3OCl pellets compressed between graphite-coated copper foil was tested in the temperature range of 160˚C and 200˚C using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Arrhenius plots demonstrated linear behavior in the whole temperature range with a calculated activation energy of 0.98 eV. At lower temperatures, EIS data was not available likely due to high impedance from the thickness of the electrolyte pellet, high activation energy, or slow migration of sodium ions through the Na3OCl structure. To decrease electrolyte thickness, we implement physical vapor deposition (PVD) thermal evaporation to coat thin films (<100 µm) of the electrolyte onto graphite-coated copper foil and sodium-based cathodes for use in symmetric cell and half-cell configurations. The melting and crystallization temperatures were determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The purity of as-synthesized sodium oxychloride and PVD-deposited layer was evaluated using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results on chemical composition and crystal-to-glass phase transformations are produced from in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy in the temperature range from 25˚C up to the melting point of Na3OCl. Cross-sectional SEM images of PVD-deposited sodium oxychloride showed an even distribution of sodium, oxygen, and chlorine. However, XRD analysis of deposited layers showed that sodium oxychloride had a tendency to decompose into the precursors during deposition. This work is focused on maintaining the sodium oxychloride composition and structure during PVD thermal evaporation by optimizing the PVD deposition parameters.\n The authors acknowledge financial support from the NSF IUCRC program for the “Center for solid-state electric power storage” (#2052631) and support from the South Dakota Board of Regents for the “Governor’s Research Center (GRC) for electrochemical energy storage”.",

Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) has attracted extensive attention owning to its high theoretical capacity, stable structure, and low cost of raw materials.

To make up for the lost sodium-ion, pre-sodiation treatments have been applied, which are effective ways to mitigate the low initial efficiency. Here, we developed a direct-contact method to achieve the pre-sodiation for cathode and anode electrodes and demonstrated the enhanced coulombic efficiency of the first cycle with improved cyclability and reversible capacity. Moreover, we proved the formation of a thick passivation layer at the cathode-electrolyte interface during the pre-sodiation process; this contributes to the improved cycle stability by preventing the dissolution of the active material and its deposition on the anode surface. The direct-contact method is a simple and cost-effective way to complete pre-sodiation, and this simple process will be widely applicable for practical battery manufacturing.",

        "abstract": "Among cathodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), layered transition metal oxides Na\n x\n MO2 (M = transition metal) are very promising due to their easy synthesis and high theoretical capacity.1,2 In this class, Ni/Mn/Fe-based layered oxides are attractive due to the high redox potential of Ni2+/ Ni4+ and Jahn Teller inactive centers (Ni2+, Fe3+,and Mn4+).3 However, complex phase transitions, Na+/vacancy ordering and transition-metal (TM) migration degrade their electrochemical performances.4 To address the issues, a widely studied cathode- P2-type Na0.67[Ni0.33Mn0.67]O2 is chosen and Li+ is substituted in the TM-layer to tailor a series of high Na-content cathodes. Among them, Na0.85[Li0.14Ni0.29Mn0.57]O2 cathode with optimal Li-substitution exhibits a reversible capacity of 168 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C rate and good cycling stability (82% retention after 100 cycles).5\n In-situ XRD measurement reveals a complete solid-solution formation and X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies confirm the participation of Ni4+/Ni2+ and Mn4+/Mn3+ redox couples during Na+-extraction/insertion. Lastly, a full Na-ion cell with hard carbon is demonstrated with an energy density of 420 Wh kg-1. In subsequent work, a Li and Ti co-substitution strategy is applied to design a high-entropy O3-type NaLixNiyFezMn0.5Ti0.5-aO2 cathode.6 It retains 77% of its initial capacity after 400 cycles at a 2 C rate with a facile O3-P3-OP2-P3-O3 phase transition. The co-substitution strategy uplifts the average voltage of the system, improves the reversibility of the high-voltage OP2 phase, and enhances the Na-ion diffusion rate. A mere 1.32% unit cell volume change and diminishing electrochemical cell resistance over cycling ensure its superior long-term cycling performance. A full cell is fabricated, which holds 62% of its initial capacity even after 1000 cycles at a 0.5 C rate. Therefore, mono- and di-ion substitution strategies hold enormous potential for designing high-performing P2- and O3-type cathode materials for practical SIBs.\n \n References\n \n \n T. Hosaka, K.

Employing an ion-exchange strategy, conformal Sn-Na alloy-SEI on the interface of Na-NPs is constructed, forming Sn@Na-NPs. The stable alloy-based SEI layer possesses the following three advantages: 1) significantly enhancing the transport dynamics of Na+ ions and electrons; 2) enabling the well-distributed deposition of Na+ ions to avoid the growth of dendrites; and 3) protecting the Sn@Na-NPs anode from the attack of electrolyte, thereby reducing the parasitic reaction and boosting the Coulombic efficiency of SMBs. Because of these virtues, the symmetric Sn@Na-NPs cell shows an ultralow voltage hysteresis of 0.54 V at 10 mA cm-2 after 600 h.

        "abstract": "P2‐type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 is a promising cathode for sodium‐ion batteries with features of high specific capacity and air resistance, whereas its cycling stability and rate performance are dissatisfactory suffering from the disastrous P2‐O2 phase transition and Na+/vacancy ordering during sodium‐ion de/intercalation, which makes it an obstruction for future practical applications. Herein, a delicate multicomponent modulation strategy is proposed to tackle these two issues simultaneously, in which Li+ and Ti4+ are introduced to replace the Ni2+ and Mn4+, respectively, whereas the Na+ content is also designed according to the principle of charge balance. Consequently, the designed cathode (Na0.72Ni0.28Li0.05Mn0.57Ti0.10O2) can deliver an enchanting cycling stability of 80% at 1 C after 200 cycles along with a considerable rate performance of 82.7 mAh g−1 at 5 C.

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is one of the most potential cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), but its actual electrochemical performance is limited by the defects of large electron and ion transfer resistance. Multicomponent design is considered an effective method to optimize the conductivity of NVP electrodes. Therefore, Cr and Si are added in NVP to form a multielement component of Na3V1.9Cr0.1(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1 (NVP-CS). It is confirmed that 3d electrons of Cr are beneficial for improving the conductivity and increasing the average potential by activating V4+/V5+. Theoretical calculations show that the introduction of Si changes the electronic structure of V and O, thus promoting the electrochemical reaction of V3+/V4+ to exert higher capacity. Due to the coordination of the two elements, a lower migration barrier is obtained in NVP-CS. Specifically, NVP-CS retains the advantages of single-doped electrodes very well (capacity retention of 90% after 300 cycles at 1 C and a high capacity of 94.1 mA h g-1 at 5 C, compared to NVP with only 82.6% capacity retention at 1 C and 59.4 mA h g-1 at 5 C). The excellent electrochemical performance results show that NVP can be successfully optimized by the introduction of Cr and Si. This work can provide some inspiration for multicomponent material research of cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "Sodium (Na)-ion batteries (NIBs) are promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries, because they use abundant and inexpensive sodium-based raw materials and have similar manufacturing processes to lithium-ion batteries. Prussian White (PW) cathodes in NIBs rival the lithium iron phosphate cathode for lithium-ion batteries; they have high energy density, tunable redox potentials, and they are inexpensive and easy to synthesize. Despite their benefits, PW materials are hygroscopic and suffer structural instability associated with the adsorption of water. Additionally, side reactions with and dissolution into the electrolyte can cause PW cathode degradation during cycling. While the synthesis of PW for NIBs often requires acidic conditions that evolve HCN, we have developed a neutral aqueous synthesis method for an iron-manganese based PW cathode that uses non-hazardous, inexpensive materials. Furthermore, surface modifications including metallic doping were studied to better understand the impact that surface stabilization has on the electrochemical behavior of PW cathodes. In this study, we have employed characterization techniques including X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, as well as extensive electrochemical testing to study how our synthesis and post-synthesis modifications impact the performance of PW cathodes. We show that our PW cathodes have improved stability against moisture and improved cycling stability.",

        "abstract": "This research highlights the efficacy of NaNbO3 as a coating for P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 cathodes in sodium-ion batteries. The coating enhances the kinetic behavior and cyclability of the electrochemical cells, as shown by electrochemical measurements. XRD analysis indicates that Nb does not incorporate into the cathode structure, implying a physical interaction between the coating and the cathode material. XRF analysis and EDX mapping confirm the actual composition and uniform dispersion of elements throughout the sample, while the electron micrographs evidence the occurrence of NaNbO3 particles modifying the surface of the layered oxide. The Ni4+/Ni3+ and Ni3+/Ni2+ redox pairs, along with the partially reversible oxidation of oxide to peroxide anions, contribute significantly to cell capacity, as revealed by XPS spectra. This last effect and the appearance of a co-intercalated phase at high voltage are positive factors to provide fast kinetics. Cyclic voltammograms show that samples coated with 2–3% NaNbO3 have superior rate capability, with high capacitive response and apparent diffusion coefficients. These samples also have low impedance at the electrode–electrolyte interface, which helps deliver a high capacity at 5C. Further cycling at 1C shows improved cyclability in the bare and 3% coated samples, due to their higher diffusion coefficients on charging. Notably, the 3% NaNbO3-coated sample exhibits excellent cyclability below 0 °C, making it a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Prussian blue analogues possess numerous advantages as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries, including high energy density, low cost, sustainability, and straightforward synthesis processes, making them highly promising for practical applications. However, during the synthesis, crystal defects such as vacancies and the incorporation of crystal water can lead to issues such as diminished capacity and suboptimal cycling stability. In the current study, a Y-tube assisted coprecipitation method was used to synthesize iron-based Prussian blue analogues, and the optimized feed flow rate during synthesis contributed to the successful preparation of the material with a formula of Na1.56Fe[Fe(CN)6]0.90□0.10·2.42H2O, representing a low-defect cathode material. This approach cleverly utilizes the Y-tube component to enhance the micro-mixing of materials in the co-precipitation reaction, featuring simplicity, low cost, user-friendly, and the ability to be used in continuous production. Electrochemical performance tests show that the sample retains 69.8% of its capacity after 200 cycles at a current density of 0.5C (1C = 140 mA g−1) and delivers a capacity of 71.9 mA h g−1 at a high rate of 10C.

        "abstract": "The battery industry is placed at a critical intersection between the two most extractive and unsustainable industries: mining and energy, where current ‘business as usual’ will lead to catastrophic outcomes for society and life on earth. This gives it a unique opportunity to be an extremely effective disruptive technology, helping end colonial systems which rely on extraction and transfer of wealth and resources from the global south to the global north, and create fair and just energy systems. In order to do this, the battery industry must make batteries from ethically sourced materials, with long lifetimes, that are recyclable. A key question remains on how exactly to evaluate the true sustainability of the components of the electric future, particularly lithium-ion batteries (LIB).\n This study presents electrochemical and materials characterisation data on several components of LIB, and a set of devised metrics for sustainability, to truly evaluate the potential of research cells in an industrial landscape.\n Lithium-ion batteries challenge the current energy system, rather than a single use system that must extract, ship and burn fuels constantly, LIB present a potential cyclical system where batteries are recharged, then repurposed before finally being recycled. Metals must still be mined, but this can be achieved sustainably in conjunction with the communities that reside in those areas, as part of an ESG initiative. In developing new technology and with the vast expansion of new industry particularly across Europe, there is enormous potential and responsibility to put in systems to facilitate a just energy transition. This applies all the way down at a materials development level. The systems to evaluate this however, are few and not widely discussed.\n In this work a case-study that aims to improve existing cell chemistry whilst focusing on its sustainability is presented. This includes the global context and in particular European criticality. The study builds on the premise behind the “Strategic materials Weighting And Value Evaluation\" (SWAVE) framework to develop it further for new cell components and combinations.1\n \n This study will focus primarily on the race to reduce cobalt and replace it with nickel and other transition metals. Reducing cobalt dependency is important to battery performance and ensuring that the energy transition is not reliant on a metal with restricted resourcing. However, whilst high nickel cathode content exhibits a higher specific capacity than cobalt-based material, it is less stable due to disordered Li+/Ni2+ cation mixing, lithium residuals upon the surface of the materials, and irreversible phase changes between the H2 and H3 phases at 4.2-4.3 V vs Li/Li+.2 Our results illustrate the difficulty in stabilizing the high nickel cathode materials with long lifetimes and discuss the possible successes in the results seen.\n Our study also explores the possibility of expanding beyond single ion systems, using alternative anode and electrolyte materials containing different ion transport. One example is Sodium, which offers a cheaper and more sustainable alternative to Lithium, and so replacing any sodium in existing cells would reduce the cost of the cell and reduce the reliance on the critical material lithium. With the creation of metrics of sustainability as within this study, any loss of capacity can be evaluated in context of the sustainability analysis to give the true ‘value’ of a potential cell in the industrial context. The feasibility of these full cell configurations are discussed, with formation, capacity and life-time testing. These results show some promising cell capacities with a variety of cell chemistries and components, whilst keeping in mind the overarching aim of a just energy transition to evaluate the developments made.\n \n References\n \n 1 R.

        "abstract": "Advancing the high-voltage stability of the O3-type layered cathodes for sodium-ion batteries is critical to boost their progress in energy storage applications. However, this type of cathode often suffers from intricate phase transition and structural degradation at high voltages (i.e., >4.0 V vs Na+/Na), resulting in rapid capacity decay. Here, we present a Li/Ti cosubstitution strategy to modify the electronic configuration of oxygen elements in the O3-type layered oxide cathode. This deliberate modulation simultaneously mitigates the phase transitions and counteracts the weakening of the shielding effect resulting from the extraction of sodium ions, thus enhancing the electrostatic bonding within the TM layer and inducing and optimizing the O3-OP2 phase transition occurring in the voltage range of 2.0-4.3 V. Consequently, the cosubstituted NaLi1/9Ni1/3Mn4/9Ti1/9O2 exhibits an astounding capacity of 161.2 mAh g-1 in the voltage range of 2.0-4.3 V at 1C, and stable cycling up to 100 cycles has been achieved.

(2) The substitution of Mg by Mn also shrinks TM-O bond and TMO2 slabs, which enhances the layered structure stability. (3) The Mg substitution also mitigates the structure distortion or volume change of the crystal lattices and suppresses the irreversible phase transitions. (4) The substitution of low-valence Mg2+ for Mn3+ reduces Mn3+ and minimizes Jahn-Teller effect, which also further alleviates the irreversible phase transformations and improves the layered structure stability.

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries have gained much attention for their potential application in large‐scale stationary energy storage due to the low cost and abundant sodium sources in the earth. However, the electrochemical performance of sodium‐ion full cells (SIFCs) suffers severely from the irreversible consumption of sodium ions of cathode during the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation of hard carbon anode. Here, a high‐efficiency cathode sodiation compensation reagent, sodium oxalate (Na2C2O4), which possesses both a high theoretical capacity of 400 mA h g−1 and a capacity utilization as high as 99%, is proposed. The implementation of Na2C2O4 as sacrificial sodium species is successfully realized by decreasing its oxidation potential from 4.41 to 3.97 V through tuning conductive additives with different physicochemical features, and the corresponding mechanism of oxidation potential manipulation is analyzed. Electrochemical results show that in the full cell based on a hard carbon anode and a P2‐Na2/3Ni1/3Mn1/3Ti1/3O2 cathode with Na2C2O4 as a sodium reservoir to compensate for sodium loss during SEI formation, the capacity retention is increased from 63% to 85% after 200 cycles and the energy density is improved from 129.2 to 172.6 W h kg−1.

        "abstract": "Although the layered P2 type-Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 materials show high discharge voltage and specific capacity, they suffer from severe structural instabilities and surface reaction upon Na exchange for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Therefore, it is quite necessary to reveal the underlying structural evolution mechanism and diffusion kinetics to improve the structural/electrochemical stability for application in SIBs. Here, we synthesize a P2 type Na0.78Al0.05Ni0.33Mn0.60O2 material by small dose of Al replacing the Mn, aiming at enhancing the structural stability without sacrificing the average discharge voltage and theoretical capacity. The etching XPS and EDX mapping/line scan results indicate that the Al doping induces the dual effects of the Al2O3 surface coating and the bulk lattice doping, which efficiently suppress the accumulation of structural irreversible changes from P2 to O2, the volume changes and surface reactions at high voltage. Obvious improvements are further found on the diffusion kinetics of Na ions as well as the decrease of overall voltage polarization. Interestingly, the dual effects of Al doping lead to the significant increase of capacity retention after 50 cycles and improvement of rate capability compared with the undoped counterpart between 2.0 - 4.5 V. Hence, this work sheds new light on stabilizing the P2-Na-Ni-Mn-O materials, which provides a rewarding avenue to develop better SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The demand for lithium has greatly increased with the rapid development of rechargeable batteries. Currently, the main lithium resource is brine lakes, but the conventional lithium recovery process is time consuming, inefficient, and environmentally harmful. Rechargeable batteries have been recently used for lithium recovery, and consist of lithium iron phosphate as a cathode. These batteries feature promising selectivity between lithium and sodium, but they suffer from severe interference from coexisting magnesium ions, an essential component of brine, which has prompted further study. This study reports on a highly selective and energy-efficient lithium recovery system using a rechargeable battery that consists of a λ-MnO2 positive electrode and a chloride-capturing negative electrode. This system can be used to recover lithium from brine even in the presence of magnesium ions as well as other dissolved cations. In addition, lithium recovery from simulated brine is successfully demonstrated, consuming 1.0 W h per 1 mole of lithium recovered, using water similar to that from the artificial brine, which contains various cations (mole ratio: Na/Li ≈ 15.7, K/Li ≈ 2.2, Mg/Li ≈ 1.9).",

        "abstract": "To develop high-performance sodium-ion batteries (NIBs), electrodes should possess well-defined pathways for efficient electronic/ionic transport. In this work, high-performance NIBs are demonstrated by designing a 3D interconnected porous structure that consists of N, S co-doped 3D porous graphene frameworks (3DPGFs-NS). The most typical electrode materials (i.e., Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 (NVP), MoS2 , and TiO2 ) are anchored onto the 3DPGFs-NS matrix (denoted as NVP@C@3DPGFs-NS; MoS2 @C@3DPGFs-NS and TiO2 @C@3DPGFs-NS) to demonstrate its general process to boost the energy density of NIBs. The N, S co-doped porous graphene structure with a large surface area offers fast ionic transport within the electrode and facilitates efficient electron transport, and thus endows the 3DPGFs-NS-based composite electrodes with excellent sodium storage performance. The resulting NVP@C@3DPGFs-NS displays excellent electrochemical performance as both cathode and anode for NIBs. The MoS2 @C@3DPGFs-NS and TiO2 @C@3DPGFs-NS deliver capacities of 317 mAhg-1 at 5 Ag-1 after 1000 cycles and 185 mAhg-1 at 1 Ag-1 after 2000 cycles, respectively. The excellent long cycle life is attributed to the 3D porous structure that could greatly release mechanical stress from repeated Na+ extraction/insertion. The novel structure 3D PGFs-NS provides a general approach to modify electrodes of NIBs and holds great potential applications in other energy storage fields.",

Herein, the anion group substitution strategy is proposed to design a cathode material with extraordinary Na+ storage performance, NASICON-Na4Fe3(PO4)1.9(SiO4)0.1P2O7 (NFPP-Si0.1). The experimental and theoretical research revealed that modification in the local structure by anion substitution significantly boosts the ionic/electronic transfer kinetics via optimizing the electronic conductivity and reducing the Na+ diffusion energy barrier. Furthermore, the SiO44- substitution generates a slight expansion of the crystal lattice to broaden the Na+ diffusion channel. Specifically, the custom-designed NFPP-Si0.1 could deliver a high rate capability of 77.6 mAh g-1 at constant 50 C charge-discharge and excellent recyclability of 79.4% retention rate after 7000 cycles at 10 C. Besides, it also possesses outstanding low temperature reversible capacity of 95.5 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C and long-term cyclability of 93.6% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 5 C in -10 °C.

These superior electrochemical performances remained stable when the Na3V2(PO4)2F3@CD cathode was used in a full cell, suggesting a promising application of the material for high rate and long lifespan sodium-ion batteries.

Usually, reducing a material's volume expansion and improving its electrical conductivity can promote electron and Li+/Na+ ion transfer in nanostructured electrodes and improve rate capability and stability. Here, we demonstrate a general metal- Aspergillus niger bioleaching approach for preparing novel fungus-inspired electrode materials that may enable high-performance lithium ion/sodium ion batteries with one-dimensional architectures. The fungus functions as a natural template to provide large amounts of nitrogen/carbon sources, which are functionalized with metal sulfide nanoparticles, yielding various metal sulfide nanoparticles/nitrogen-doped carbonaceous fibers (MS/NCF (MS = ZnS, Co9S8, FeS, Cu1.81S)) with high conductivity. In addition, the as-obtained MS/NCF has a uniform fiber architecture and abundant porous structure, which can also enhance the storage ability for LIBs and SIBs. Taking ZnS/NCF as an example, the material exhibits a high specific capacity of up to 715.5 mAh g-1 (100 cycles) and 455 mAh g-1 (50 cycles) at 0.1 A g-1 for LIBs and SIBs, respectively.

        "abstract": "Reliable operation of Na‐ion batteries requires a mastering of the interfacial processes governing intercalation kinetics. Ion desolvation, amongst others, is a crucial phenomenon as far as power applications are envisioned. Studying the intricacies of interfacial processes faces experimental challenges. Here the complementary use of electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) and operando infrared fiber evanescent wave spectroscopy (IR‐FEWS) combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is reported to investigate the electrode/electrolyte interface of polyanionic Na‐insertion compounds Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) and Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF). Through screening of various electrolytes that differ in their solvation energy and viscosity, the existence of an unusual mass uptake/depletion signal is demonstrated at the NVP interfaces only, indicative of a dissimilarity in migration kinetics of solvent molecules between NVP and NVPF interfaces as supported by IR‐FEWS. This finding is rationalized by positing that sodium depletion is caused by the unusually rapid ion diffusion within NVP mediated by an intermediate metastable phase, which leads to opposite Na+ concentration and free solvent molecule gradients at the interface that causes the unusual and anomalous feature observed on EQCM frequency profiles. This feature does not appear with NVPF showing lower ionic diffusion. Altogether, this fundamental study provides valuable fundamental insights into the interface structuring of insertion compounds depending upon their Na+ mobility.",

However, it was observed that silver electrodes damaged the tissue, since the characteristic restoration of the ion distribution after termination of stimulation was sometimes completely blocked. On average, 50 per cent of excess sodium was extruded, and 57 per cent of the potassium loss was recovered. It appears that metal electrodes require great stability of the stimulation conditions. To avoid these difficulties, carbon was tested as an electrode material. Both concentric and parallel electrodes were prepared. (A) Concentric electrodes (Fig. 1). Carbon cylinders 12 mm in height, and with an internal diameter of 17 mm, were made by boring out the centre of a commutator rod 30 mm in diameter (Fresta Ltd., Helsinki). A ring of this type was inserted into a glass vessel 45 mm in height, and of the same diameter, and fixed with Araldite hardened at room temperature. The vessel was closed with a rubber stopper fitted with four glass tubes. Two of these were used for gassing the flasks, and two for connections to the stimulator. The two connections were effected by sealing hooked platinum wires in the glass tubes. Carbon rods 5 mm in diameter (Airam Ltd., Helsinki) were introduced into the tubes, and connected to the platinum hooks by steel wire helices. One of the rods was inserted in a cavity in the centre of the flask, and the other into a cavity on the upper edge of the carbon cylinder.

The nuclear magnetic resonance phenomenon plays a pivotal role in fundamental studies of energy materials and devices because of its exceptional sensitivity to local environments and the dynamics of many electrochemically relevant elements. The jelly roll architecture is one of the most energy-dense and, therefore, most popular concepts implemented in pouch, prismatic, and cylindrical Li- and Na-ion cells. Such widely commercialized designs, however, represent a significant obstacle for a range of powerful in situ magnetic resonance-based methodologies due to negligible radio frequency electromagnetic field penetration through conductive metal casings and current collectors. In this work, we introduce an experimental setup that enables direct RF wave transmission through the cell terminals and current collectors, and provides efficient excitation and detection of NMR signals. An RF adapter designed as a plug-and-play device effectively turns the battery cell into an NMR probe that can be tuned to a broad range of Larmor frequencies. Due to its exceptional sensitivity, versatility, and multinuclear capability, the proposed methodology is suitable for fundamental research and industrial high-throughput screening applications. In situ NMR lineshapes provide a direct quantitative description of the chemical environments of electrochemically active elements and enable new metrics for the accurate assessment of state-of-charge (SoC) and state-of-health (SoH). Specifically, in commercial pouch cells based on lithium cobalt oxide, lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide, and sodium nickel iron manganese oxide chemistries, 7Li and 23Na NMR data unambiguously show electrochemical transformations between intercalated and metallic forms of charge carrier ions, and reveal anisotropic magnetic properties of the electrode coating.",

        "abstract": "Anion-reinforced solvation structure favors the formation of inorganic-rich robust electrode-electrolyte interface, which endows fast ion transport and high strength modulus to enable improved electrochemical performance. However, such a unique solvation structure inevitably injures the ionic conductivity of electrolytes and limits the fast-charging performance. Herein, a trade-off in tuning anion-reinforced solvation structure and high ionic conductivity is realized by the entropy-assisted hybrid ester-ether electrolyte. Anion-reinforced solvation sheath with more anions occupying the inner Na+ shell is constructed by introducing the weakly coordinated ether tetrahydrofuran into the commonly used ester-based electrolyte, which merits the accelerated desolvation energy and gradient inorganic-rich electrode-electrolyte interface. The improved ionic conductivity is attributed to the weakly diverse solvation structures induced by entropy effect. These enable the enhanced rate performance and cycling stability of Prussian blue||hard carbon full cells with high electrode mass loading. More importantly, the practical application of the designed electrolyte was further demonstrated by industry-level 18650 cylindrical cells.",

        "abstract": "Herein we report the studies of different physical properties (structural, magnetic, thermal, morphologic, electrical, and electrochemical) of two new allotropic β-Na2Ni2M(PO4)3 (NNMP) phosphates, with M = Fe and Al. Pure orthorhombic single-phase powders were prepared under air, using an autocombustion synthesis method. They crystallize in the orthorhombic Imma space group with similar unit cell parameters [a = 10.1592(2), b = 13.0321(3), c = 6.4864(2) Å] and [a = 10.3993(1), b = 13.1966(1), c = 6.4955(1) Å] for β-Na2Ni2M(PO4)3 (NNAP) and β-Na2Ni2Fe(PO4)3 (NNFP), respectively. Crystal structures of both compounds were determined using X-ray powder diffraction and Rietveld method refinements, which indicate the occurrence of Ni2+ in the 8g site, and of M3+ in the 4a site of the structure. The structure consists of a three-dimensional anionic framework obtained by the association on MO6, NiO6, and PO4 polyhedra, sharing edges and corners. The resulting three-dimensional structure creates monodimensional channels along the [100] and [010] directions formed by face-shared oxygen polyhedra and occupied by Na+ cations. This nondisordered cationic distribution is confirmed by a significant change of magnetic properties. Thus, both NNAP and NNFP samples show paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition at 14 and 19 K, respectively. For the two compounds, thermal stability, electrical conductivity, and electrochemical properties have been also investigated. The intercalation/desintercalation properties of NNMP compounds as positive electrode were tested in sodium-ion batteries. The first cycling curves exhibit a significant polarization for both prepared samples.",

Here, we report the unusual passivation ability of superconcentrated Na-salt electrolytes. For example, a 50 mol % sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide (NaFSA)/succinonitrile (SN) electrolyte enables highly reversible Na+ insertion into a hard carbon negative electrode without any electrolyte additive, functional binder, or electrode pretreatment. Importantly, an anion-derived passivation film is formed via preferential reduction of the anion upon charging, which can effectively suppress further electrolyte reduction. As a structural characteristic of the electrolyte, most anions are coordinated to multiple Na+ cations at high concentration, which shifts the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of the anions downward, resulting in preferential anion reduction. The present work provides a new understanding of the passivation mechanism with respect to the coordination state of the anion.",

        "abstract": "The mechanical strength and ionic conductivity of sulfide solid electrolytes have received widespread attention for their application in solid sodium batteries. Herein, first-principles calculations are used to determine the properties, including the electronic, mechanical and ionic transport properties, of Na3PS4 sulfide solid electrolytes doped with low and high Ca ion concentrations. Our theoretical results demonstrate that low Ca ion concentrations can be easily doped in tetragonal and cubic phases (t-Na3PS4 and c-Na3PS4) and create a suitable number of Na vacancies based on the formation energy analysis. Furthermore, the calculated density of states and charge density differences indicate that the surrounding electronic environment is changed, and Ca-S ionic bonds are formed in Na3PS4 with Ca-doping. In addition, the improved ductility and mechanical strength of c-Na3PS4 and t-Na3PS4 achieved by low-concentration Ca doping may help suppress dendritic growth and electrode deformation. Finally, sodium ion migration in Ca-doped Na3PS4 is described with the aid of the CI-NEB method, and it is found that the migration energy barriers are less than those of pure Na3PS4, which suggests that the sodium ion conductivity can be effectively improved by doping with low Ca2+ concentrations. The present work improves the understanding of the influence of doping on the performance of solid electrolytes and provides a feasible framework for the future design of high-performance solid electrodes.",

Our density functional theory calculation suggests that this is due to a large Na+ ion diffusion barrier in the innate g-C3N4 nanosheet. Here we strategically apply a facile one-pot heating of a mixture of low-cost urea and asphalt to yield stacked multilayer C/g-C3N4 composites with improved Na-storage capacity (about 2 times higher than that of g-C3N4, up to 254 mAh/g), rate capability and cyclability. A C/g-C3N4 sodium-ion full cell (in which sodium rhodizonate dibasic is used as the positive electrode) demonstrates high Coulombic efficiency (~99.8%) and a negligible capacity fading over 14,000 cycles at 1 A/g.

        "abstract": "The chemical environments of the interlayer Na sites of layered titanate are finely controlled by the intercalation of n-alkylamine with various alkyl chain lengths to explore an effective way to improve its electrode functionality for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The n-alkylamine intercalation via ion-exchange and exfoliation-restacking routes allows the modification of in-plane structures of layered titanate to be tuned. Among the present n-alkylamine-intercalates, the n-pentylamine-intercalated titanate shows the largest discharge capacity with the best rate characteristics, underscoring the critical role of optimized intracrystalline structure in improving the SIB electrode performance of layered titanate. The creation of turbostratic in-plane structure degrades the SIB electrode performance of layered titanate, indicating the detrimental effect of in-plane structural disorder on electrode activity. 23Na magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrates that the n-alkylamine-intercalated titanates possess two different interlayer Na+ sites near ammonium head groups/titanate layers and near alkyl chains. The intercalation of long-chain molecules increases the population of the latter site and the overall mobility of Na+ ions, which is responsible for the improvement of electrode activity upon n-alkylamine intercalation. The present study highlights that the increased population of interlayer metal sites remote from the host layers is effective in improving the electrode functionality of layered metal oxide for SIBs and multivalent ion batteries.",

However, their stability in aqueous environments is relatively low limiting the application of these materials in aqueous batteries or deionization cells. In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis of Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)2F3 degradation in aqueous media using a number of techniques such as standard electrochemical methods, elemental analysis, powder X-ray diffractometry, and rotating ring-disc electrode method. The latter allows for real time in situ/operando degradation analysis. The results show that Na3V2(PO4)3 suffers from chemical vanadium dissolution in neutral pH, whereas it is negligible in Na3V2(PO4)2F3. The results obtained in unbuffered electrolytes by the ring-disc electrode technique explicitly show that Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)2F3 generate most of the soluble V(V) species during the charging process. Whereas at lower pH, there is an additional electrochemically-induced generation of soluble V(IV) species during discharging as well. The overall results suggest that fluoride ions significantly increase the structural stability of phosphate materials in aqueous environments and a careful electrolyte design with controlled proton and water activity could enable the use of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 in water-based electrochemical devices.",

The former cell shows highly reversible charge/discharge curves with a mean discharge voltage of 1.4 V. Although the latter cell exhibits capacity degradation, it demonstrates 2 V-class operations. Analysis data of the two cells confirmed that Na+ ions were mainly inserted into the negative electrodes passivated by a Na-rich solid electrolyte interphase, and both Na+ and K+ ions were inserted into the positive electrode.

These technologies may employ different electrode materials, most importantly high-surface-area nanoporous carbon, two-dimensional materials, and metal oxides. All of these materials also find more and more applications in electrochemical desalination devices. During the electrochemical operation of such electrode materials, charge storage and ion immobilization are accomplished by non-Faradaic ion electrosorption, Faradaic ion intercalation at specific crystallographic sites, or ion insertion between layers of two-dimensional materials. These processes may or may not be associated with a (partial) loss of the aqueous solvation shell around the ions. Our work showcases the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance as an excellent tool for quantifying the change in effective solvation. We chose sodium as an important cation for energy storage materials (sodium-based aqueous electrolytes) and electrochemical desalination (saline media). Our data show that a major amount of water uptake occurs during ion electrosorption in nanoporous carbon, while battery-like ion insertion between layers of titanium disulfide is associated with an 80% loss of the initially present solvation molecules. Sodiation of MXene is accomplished by a loss of 90% of the number of solvent molecules, but nanoconfined water in-between the MXene layers may compensate for this large degree of desolvation. In the case of sodium manganese oxide, we were able to demonstrate the full loss of the solvation shell.",

With electric current passing through, sodium and chloride ions are released or absorbed by two aerogel electrodes. This system achieves super high desalination capacity, excellent cycling stability, and rapid desalination rate. The desalination capacity is as high as 107.5 mg g-1 after 50 cycles with the current density of 100 mA g-1 . The outstanding desalination performance of this system shows a synergistic effect of combining battery materials with graphene for deionization and promises a new potential alternative of future desalination design.",

        "abstract": "There is a great deal of demand for rechargeable Li-ion batteries due to their high energy and power density compared to other rechargeable batteries. Despite the concern about limited lithium resources, scientists have re-examined sodium-ion batteries, since sodium is below lithium on the periodic table, and the two metals have many similar properties. As a result of its low cost, good cycle life, and reversible capacity, hard carbon (HC) is considered to be the most attractive negative electrode material for sodium-ion batteries. Nevertheless, the practical application of HC remains challenging due to its low capacity and initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). We investigated how pre-treatment conditions affected the graphitization degree in order to overcome these issues. In addition, we observed a strong correlation between pre-oxidation and electrochemical performance when the carbonization temperature was increased. The observed results will be presented during the presentation.\n \n Acknowledgments \n \n This work was funded by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan Grant (AP09259165) and by Nazarbayev University under Collaborative Research Program Grant № 20122022P1611, AK.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries utilize various electrode materials derived from lithium batteries. However, the different characteristics inherent in sodium may cause unexpected cell reactions and battery performance. Thus, identifying the reactive discrepancy between sodiation and lithiation is essential for fundamental understanding and practical engineering of battery materials. Here we reveal a heterogeneous sodiation mechanism of iron fluoride (FeF2) nanoparticle electrodes by combining in situ/ex situ microscopy and spectroscopy techniques. In contrast to direct one-step conversion reaction with lithium, the sodiation of FeF2 proceeds via a regular conversion on the surface and a disproportionation reaction in the core, generating a composite structure of 1-4 nm ultrafine Fe nanocrystallites (further fused into conductive frameworks) mixed with an unexpected Na3FeF6 phase and a NaF phase in the shell. These findings demonstrate a core-shell reaction mode of the sodiation process and shed light on the mechanistic understanding extended to generic electrode materials for both Li- and Na-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This article discusses the conversion of electrodeposited iodine to polyiodides within the nanopores of carbon electrodes that affect the performance of iodide electrolyte‐based electrochemical cells. Here, carbon electrodes have been polarized in aqueous sodium iodide electrolyte to store charge in the form of solid iodine via highly reversible reaction (2I−⇌I2+2e−). The stored iodine within the pores interacts with free iodide ions present in the bulk electrolyte via comproportionation reactions leading to polyiodide (I3 − and I5 −) formations. By tuning the mass asymmetry of carbon electrodes in hybrid cells and using the in‐situ Raman spectroscopy on positive battery electrode, we show the influence of iodine/polyiodides equilibrium shifts on the self‐discharge and voltage rebounds during open circuit conditions. This study provides insights into the charging mechanisms of carbon electrodes for iodine‐based hybrid supercapacitors and battery systems.",

        "abstract": "Layered titania (L-TiO2 ) holds great potential for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high specific capacity. Synthesizing L-TiO2 functional materials for high-capacity and long cyclability battery remains challenging due to the unstable and poor conductivity of bare L-TiO2 . In nature, plant growth can stabilize land by preventing sands from dispersing following desertification. Inspired by nature's \"sand-fixation model,\" Al3+ \"seeds\" are in situ grown on layered Ti3 C2 Tx \"land.\" Subsequently, NH2 -MIL-101(Al) \"plants\" with Al as metal nodes are grown on the Ti3 C2 Tx \"land\" by self-assembly. After annealing and etching processes (similar to desertification), NH2 -MIL-101(Al) is transformed into interconnected N/O-doped carbon (MOF-NOC), which not only acts as a plant-like function to prevent the pulverization of L-TiO2 transformed from Ti3 C2 Tx but also improves the conductivity and stability of MOF-NOC@L-TiO2 . Al species are selected as seeds to improve interfacial compatibility and form intimate interface heterojunction. Systematic ex situ analysis discloses that the ions storage mechanism can be endowed by mixed contribution of non-Faradaic and Faradaic capacitance. Consequently, the MOF-NOC@L-TiO2 electrodes exhibit high interfacial capacitive charge storage and outstanding cycling performance. The interface engineering strategy inspired by \"sand-fixation model\" provides a reference for designing stable layered composites.",

In particular, coronene, phenalene derivatives as well as disodium terephthalate and related fused ring derivatives, representing often used building blocks in organic electrode materials, are chosen as model systems. We show that p-doping can drastically increase the binding strength to Li or Na and is therefore an effective strategy to design organic electrode materials for both lithium and sodium ion batteries. It could also be used to increase the theoretical capacity. On the other hand, n-doping generally has a much smaller effect on the voltage. The effects of n- and p-doping are rationalized based on the analysis of changes they induce in the band structure as well as in the molecular structure.",

        "abstract": "The pursuit of high-performance batteries has propelled the investigation into advanced materials and design methodologies. Herein, the yolk-shell MnSe/ZnSe heterojunction encapsulated in hollow carbontubes (MnSe/ZnSe@HCTs) is prepared as a prospective electrode material for sodium/potassium batteries. The band structure in the heterojunction is methodically adjusted and regulated by intentionally utilizing Mn with unpaired electrons in the 3d orbital. The ZnSe shell confer effectively mitigates volumetric expansion challenges inherent in ions insertion/extraction processes and 1D carbontubular conductive substrate avert the aggregation of MnSe/ZnSe nanoparticles. Concurrently, the heterojunctions implantation induces sublattice distortion and charge redistribution, enriching active sites and regulating band structure. The selenium vacancies within these heterojunctions contribute to the provision of abundant active sites, thereby promoting efficient ions insertion/extraction. In sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), MnSe/ZnSe@HCTs present a superior capacity of 475 mA hg-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and sustains a capacity of 408.5 mAh g-1 even after 1000 cycles. In potassium-ion batteries (KIBs), MnSe/ZnSe@HCTs deliver a higher specific capacity of 422 mAh g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1 and maintain a high coulombic efficiency of 99% after 1000 cycles.

        "abstract": "\n Electrochemical energy storage devices are of interest, especially aqueous sodium ion batteries(ASIBs), due to their safety, low-cost, and environmental friendliness. However, ASIBs suffer from poor cyclic stability and a narrow electrochemical window, which hinders their large-scale application. Compared to the traditional dilute saline electrolytes, high concentration electrolytes show a wider potential window. In this study, we designed a novel NaClO4-H2O/DMSO-Urea hybrid electrolyte to suppress these problems, in which DMSO and Urea create a synergistic effect. The formation of hydrogen bonds between DMSO and H2O reduced water activity, thereby suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction. The addition of DMSO resulted in the reduction from -1.2 to -1.6 V for the hydrogen evolution potential. Therefore, we were able to expand the electrochemical window on the basis of reducing the concentration of sodium salts. Moreover, the addition of Urea facilitated formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface on the electrode surface, which improved the cycling stability of NVP/C (Na3V2(PO3)4/C) symmetric cell which exhibited a specific capacity of 59.7 mAh g-1 with the retention capacity of 80.1 % after 200 cycles at 1 C.

        "abstract": "Compared with the extensively used ester‐based electrolyte, the hard carbon (HC) electrode is more compatible with the ether‐based counterpart in sodium‐ion batteries, which can lead to improved cycling stability and robust rate capability. However, the impact of salt anion on the electrochemical performance of HC electrodes has yet to be fully understood. In this study, the anionic chemistry in regulating the stability of electrolytes and the performance of sodium‐ion batteries have been systematically investigated. This work shows discrepancies in the reductive stability of the anionic group, redox kinetics, and component/structure of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) with different salts (NaBF4, NaPF6, and NaSO3CF3) in the typical ether solvent (diglyme). Particularly, the density functional theory calculation manifests the preferred decomposition of PF6− due to the reduced reductive stability of anions in the solvation structure, thus leading to the formation of NaF‐rich SEI. Further investigation on redox kinetics reveals that the NaPF6/diglyme can induce the fast ionic diffusion dynamic and low charge transfer barrier for HC electrode, thus resulting in superior sodium storage performance in terms of rate capability and cycling life, which outperforms those of NaBF4/diglyme and NaSO3CF3/diglyme. Importantly, this work offers valuable insights for optimizing the electrochemical behaviors of electrode materials by regulating the anionic group in the electrolyte.",

However, the charge storage capability and mechanism of Te in potassium‐ion batteries (KIBs) have not been unveiled until now.

Consequently, the rationally fabricated tellurium/porous carbon electrodes deliver an ultrahigh reversible volumetric capacity of 2493.13 mAh cm−3 at 0.5 C (based on Te), a high‐rate capacity of 783.13 mAh cm−3 at 15 C, and superior long‐term cycling stability for 1000 cycles at 5 C.

A combined study of Raman spectroscopy and inductive coupled plasma emission spectroscopy reveals that the evolution of Li4Ti5O12 surface in a water‐based hydrothermal environment is a hydrolysis–recrystallization process, which can introduce a new phase of anatase‐TiO2. While, with a small amount of Na2S (0.004 mol L−1 at least), the spinel‐Li4Ti5O12 phase is maintained without a second phase. During this process, the alkaline environment created by Na2S and the surface adsorption of the sulfur‐containing group (HS− or S2−) can suppress the recrystallization of anatase‐TiO2 and renew the particle surfaces. This finding gives a better understanding of the surface–property relationship on Li4Ti5O12 and guidance on preparation and modification of electrode material other than coating or doping.",

        "title": "Comparative life cycle assessment of lithium‐ion, sodium‐ion, and solid‐state battery cells for electric vehicles",
        "abstract": "The transition toward electrification of transportation has resulted in a rapid increase in the demand for battery cells. While this demand is currently being met through the use of lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), alternative batteries like sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) and solid‐state batteries (SSBs) are emerging as relevant alternatives. In this study, we analyze, based on current electric vehicle electrode stack designs, the environmental impact of LIB cells, SIB cells, and SSB cells. The life cycle assessment results from this cradle‐to‐gate study show that for LIB cell production today, ∼58–92 kgCO2‐eq are emitted per kWhcell and ∼296–624 kWhCED/kWhcell of primary energy is required. In SIB cell production, ∼75–87 kgCO2‐eq/kWhcell is emitted, and in SSB cell production, ∼88–130 kgCO2‐eq/kWhcell, depending on their specific electrode stack configuration. The results demonstrate that LFP (lithium–iron–phosphate) cells require the least energy for production across all battery types under analysis. Furthermore, the findings indicate that, in terms of global warming potential (GWP), LFP and NMC900 (nickel–manganese–cobalt) cells are the most sustainable battery types, at least when focusing solely on battery cell production and neglecting subsequent use phases. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that by optimizing the cell designs and their production, the environmental impact of battery cell production can be reduced in the short term by up to −38%. This allows the production of LFP battery cells with a low GWP of ∼37 kgCO2‐eq/kWhcell and NMC900 cells with ∼44 kgCO2‐eq/kWhcell. Moreover, there is considerable room for improvement in other major LIB cell types. This article met the requirements for a gold‐gold JIE data openness badge described at http://jie.click/badges.",

        "abstract": "Developing super-foldable electronic materials and devices presents a significant challenge, as intrinsic conductive materials are unable to achieve numerous true-folding operations (super-foldable) due to limitations from short-range forces of chemical bonds. Consequently, super-foldable batteries remain unexplored. This work focused on sodium-ion batteries as a breakthrough point to advance super-foldable devices. By employing a \"2+1\" bioinspired strategy, we stepwise designed and assembled super-foldable components, from substrates to electrodes, and to ultimately device. This bioinspired approach completely disperses folding stress and thus prevents the breakage of chemical bonds, enabling the successful fabrication of the first super-foldable ion battery. This battery can withstand true-folding at any angle, in any direction, and for an unprecedented number of cycles-far outperforming current foldable phones with hinge structures. Remarkably, after 500,000 true-folding cycles, the battery's microstructure remains intact with no significant degradation of electrochemical performance. Real-time dynamic folding observations reveal an M-shaped folding structure within the bioinspired materials, which effectively disperses stress via bulged layers, dispersed arcs, and slidable microgrooves that work together across different directions and dimensions to achieve super-foldability. Mechanical simulations vividly verify this principle. This work represents a breakthrough in super-foldable devices, offering valuable insights and promoting practical application for future super-foldable devices.",

Composite electrodes containing these anionic-MOFs were prepared and tested in 1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) in propylene carbonate (PC) and/or 1 M sodium TFSI (NaTFSI) in PC. We showed that the ion-exchanged materials JUMP-1(Li) and JUMP-1(Na) display higher capacities in comparison with the original as-prepared compound JUMP-1 (490 mA∙h∙g−1 vs. 164 mA∙h∙g−1 and 83 mA∙h∙g−1 vs. 73 mA∙h∙g−1 in Li and Na based electrolytes, respectively). Additionally, we showed that the stability of the electrodes containing the ion-exchanged materials is higher than that of JUMP-1, suggesting a form of chemical pre-alkalation works to stabilize them prior to cycling.

Though electrochemical energy storage devices such as batteries offer an attractive solution, current commercial battery technology cannot provide adequate power, and cycle life, and energy efficiency at a sufficiently low cost. Copper hexacyanoferrate and nickel hexacyanoferrate, two open framework materials with the Prussian Blue structure, were recently shown to offer ultralong cycle life and high-rate performance when operated as battery electrodes in safe, inexpensive aqueous sodium ion and potassium ion electrolytes. In this report, we demonstrate that the reaction potential of copper-nickel alloy hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles may be tuned by controlling the ratio of copper to nickel in these materials. X-ray diffraction, TEM energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and galvanostatic electrochemical cycling of copper-nickel hexacyanoferrate reveal that copper and nickel form a fully miscible solution at particular sites in the framework without perturbing the structure. This allows copper-nickel hexacyanoferrate to reversibly intercalate sodium and potassium ions for over 2000 cycles with capacity retentions of 100% and 91%, respectively. The ability to precisely tune the reaction potential of copper-nickel hexacyanoferrate without sacrificing cycle life will allow the development of full cells that utilize the entire electrochemical stability window of aqueous sodium and potassium ion electrolytes.",

        "abstract": "Herein, we detail an approach to accelerate the computational screening of materials for properties dictated by the kinetics of solid state diffusion through reliably and rapidly identifying upper and lower bounds to the transition state (TS) energy through our proposed modified single iteration synchronous-transit (MSIST) approach. While this sacrifices providing detailed information of the explicit TS structure, it requires only ~30% of the force evaluations of a full nudged elastic band (NEB) TS search and reduces the computational demand to compute estimated diffusion barriers by 70% on average. In all 53 cases in which we explicitly compared our results to those of an NEB calculation, the upper and lower bounds identified using this approach bracketed the TS energy calculated with explicit NEB calculations. We use the applications of diffusion of Na+ in potential sodium-ion battery electrodes and oxygen vacancy diffusion in solid oxide fuel cell electrodes and redox mediators for solar thermochemical hydrogen production to demonstrate the power of MSIST for analyzing the kinetics of bulk diffusion. For Na+ diffusion through 13 proposed electrode materials in which the average diffusion barrier was 0.28 eV, the average difference between the upper and lower bounds was 0.08 eV. An iterative application of this approach to the 3 materials with the largest difference between their upper and lower bounds further narrowed the average range of the bounded TS energies to 0.04 eV, while still requiring fewer force evaluations than an NEB TS calculation. When applied in a high throughput manner to study 514 diffusion pathways in 97 different materials, the average difference between the upper and lower bounds was 0.33 eV and the average barrier, as calculated by the average of all upper and lower bounds, was ~1.7 eV. Because the MSIST approach produces explicit errors, i.e. the difference between the upper and lower bounds energies, even predicted barrier ranges with large errors can be reliably modeled with weighted regression techniques. MSIST enables the analysis of the kinetics of solid state diffusion across larger sets of materials and can thus efficiently provide data to train statistically learned models of diffusion and to develop physical insights into the diffusion process.",

        "title": "FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS BASED ON HARD CARBON DOPED WITH MOLYBDENUM: PREPARATION AND CHARACTERIZATION",
        "abstract": "Hard carbon is one of the most promising candidates for a negative electrode material for sodium-ion batteries. Now, the design and adaptation of methods for producing hard carbon have gained wide attention in terms of not only ensuring the required electrochemical performance but also reducing production costs and expenses. Herein, we report a method for preparing new functional materials based on hard carbon doped with molybdenum. A viscose was used as a carbon precursor because of its low cost and availability, which made it possible to scale the technology. An ammonium molybdate aqueous solution was applied as the molybdenum source. The synthesis involves following main steps: impregnation of the fiber with a solution of ammonium molybdate and annealing at high temperatures under controlled atmosphere. The study investigates the effects of the type of initial viscose raw material (microfiber, technical thread, non-woven material), molybdenum content (Mo/C weight ratio varied in the range up to 5.1%), temperature (up to 1050 °C), and annealing atmosphere (argon or nitrogen) on the structural parameters, specific surface area, and yield of hard carbon products. The doped hard carbon has an almost 10% higher yield in comparison with the undoped one. It was shown that doping with molybdenum, due to the catalytic effect, stimulates the growth and ordering of graphite-like nanoclusters under the temperature, inducing the structure formation of hard carbon. This leads to a decrease in the temperature of hard carbon production as compared to analogues. It was found that changing the specific surface area with temperature depends on the molybdenum content. The lowest values of specific surface area were found for doped samples synthesized at 1050 °C. \nFor citation: \n Saenko N.S., Zheleznov V.V., Mayorov V.Yu., Opra D.P.

        "abstract": "The development of novel redox-active polymers for sustainable sodium ion batteries (SIBs) has captured growing attention, but battery performance has been significantly limited by poor reversible specific capacities, where the majority of aromatic C6-benzene linkages are redox inactive. Here, a simple, yet efficient approach to improve sodium (Na) storage on these C6-benzene rings within a porous polymeric framework by rationally regulating their steric hindrance is reported. Decreasing intrinsic hindrance affords a significant improvement in redox reaction kinetics within the porous architecture, thereby facilitating the acceptance of Na ions on these functionalized benzene rings and boosting the SIB performance. As a result, the modulate porous framework exhibits an exceptional battery capacity of 376 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1 , which is ≈1.5 times larger than that of the pristine framework. Furthermore, the performance can reach as high as 510 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 , comparable to that of the best-performing polymeric electrodes. The simple modulation approach not only enables Na storage modulation on functionalized C6-benzene rings, but also simultaneously provides a means to extend the understanding of the structure-property relationship and facilitate new possibilities for organic SIBs.",

Phase transformations related to incomplete sodiation in tin during cycling, in the presence of a frail solid electrolyte interphase layer, can quickly weaken the structural stability. The structural dynamics and reactivity of the electrode/electrolyte interface, being further dependent on the size and morphology of the active material particle in the presence of different electrolytes, dictate the electrode degradation and survivability during cycling. In this study, we paint a comprehensive picture of the underpinnings of the electrochemical and mechanics coupling and electrode/electrolyte interfacial interactions in alloying Sn electrodes.

Herein, an environmental friendly and versatile strategy is proposed to engineer anisotropically curved nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (CNCNs) derived from biosources with hydrosoluble and recyclable flux. After undergoing serious corrosion from the LiCl/KCl binary flux, the resulting CNCNs possess high structural stability. Notably, the CNCNs also possess a rational specific surface area, open porous structure, and abundant accessible edges, which can shorten the ion-diffusion path, provide abundant accessible active sites, and result in less charge-transfer impedance and excellent sodium-ion diffusion coefficient (8.9×10-10  cm2  s-1 ). As a consequence, CNCN electrodes can deliver a high specific capacity of 361.6 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 .

        "abstract": "A novel design of a sodium-ion cell is proposed based on the use of nanocrystalline thin films composed of transition metal oxides. X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy were helpful techniques to unveil the microstructural properties of the pristine nanostructured electrodes. Thus, Raman spectroscopy revealed the presence of amorphous NiO, α-Fe2 O3 (hematite) and γ-Fe2 O3 (maghemite). Also, this technique allowed the calculation of an average particle size of 23.4 Å in the amorphous carbon phase in situ generated on the positive electrode. The full sodium-ion cell performed with a reversible capacity of 100 mA h g(-1) at C/2 with an output voltage of about 1.8 V, corresponding to a specific energy density of about 180 W h kg(-1) . These promising electrochemical performances allow these transition metal thin films obtained by electrochemical deposition to be envisaged as serious competitors for future negative electrodes in sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "This study centers on indium‐ion solid‐state batteries. Indium is a soft metal that provides excellent adhesion and does not generate dendrites during the charge–discharge process. The solid‐state electrolyte material, sodium‐based silicate, is an environmentally friendly material that offers better thermal stability compared to liquid electrolytes and reduces packaging requirements. The positive electrode material, a graphite film (GF), features a layered structure, enabling the stable insertion and extraction of ions. In this experiment, graphite film doped sodium phosphate (GFN) are used as positive electrodes, sodium‐based silicate powder through cloth deposition (battery cloth deposition [BCD]) is used as the electrolyte and indium is used as the negative electrode. To improve the low capacity of indium electrodes, indium is alloyed with silver and prepared by thermal evaporation method. The results show that the In‐30Ag with Cu substrate (weight ratio of In‐30 wt.% Ag) exhibits higher cycling capacity (61 mAhg−1). To further increase the capacity, the substrate of In‐30Ag is replaced from copper foil to aluminum foil. According to result, the capacity of In‐30Ag with Al substrate (91 mAhg−1) exhibits 1.6 times higher compared to In‐30Ag with Cu substrate. However, In‐30Ag with Al substrate after vacuum heat treatment, the thin film exhibits melting and agglomeration, leading to a decrease in capacity. Thus, the unheated In‐30Ag (Al substrate)/2×BCD/GFN system is subjected to large‐area module testing using an industrial fan as the load, confirming its practical applications.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfides have a great potential for energy storage due to the pronouncedly higher capacity (owing to conversion to metal or even alloy) than traditional insertion electrode materials. However, the poor cycling stability still limits the development and application in lithium and sodium ion batteries. Here, taking SnS as a model material, a novel general strategy is proposed to fabricate a 3D porous interconnected metal sulfide/carbon nanocomposite by the electrostatic spray deposition technique without adding any expensive carbonaceous materials such as graphene or carbon nanotube. In this way, small nanorods of SnS are generated with sizes of ≈10–20 nm embedded in amorphous carbon and self‐assembled into a 3D porous interconnected nanocomposite. The SnS:C is directly deposited on the Ti foil as a current collector and neither conductive additives nor binder are needed for battery assembly. Such electrodes exhibit a high reversible capacity, high rate capability, and long cycling stability for both lithium and sodium storage.",

However, there are still many challenging problems limiting practical application of this emerging technology, in particular complex manufacturing process, high fabrication cost, and low loading mass of active material. Different from existing fabrication strategies, here using a CoP alloy foil as a precursor a simple neutral salt solution‐mediated electrochemical dealloying method to well address the above issues is demonstrated. The resultant freestanding mesoporous np‐Co(OH)x/Co2P product possesses not only active compositions of high specific capacity and large electrode packing density (>3.0 g cm−3) to meet practical capacity requirements, high‐conductivity and well‐developed nanoporous framework to achieve simultaneously fast ion and electron transfer, but also interconnected ligaments and suitable free space to ensure strong structural stability. Its comprehensively excellent electrochemical energy storage (EES) performances in both lithium/sodium‐ion batteries and lithium‐ion capacitors can further illustrate the effectiveness of the integrated electrode preparation strategy, such as remarkable reversible specific capacities/capacitances, dominated pseudo‐capacitive EES mechanism, and ultra‐long cycling life.

However, the generally used carbonate electrolytes remain highly reactive towards Na metal, leaving flammable gas evolution. Here, we propose an electrolyte sieving strategy to separate anion-mediated ion-pairs from dilute electrolytes by introducing a 3A zeolite molecular sieve film. The anion-mediated ion-pair firstly weakens the electron withdrawing property of the cation, which effectively suppresses the gassing. In addition, the sieved electrolyte promotes the formation of robust inorganic-dominated solid electrolyte interphases. Therefore, it contributes to stable Na plating/stripping in Na|Al half cells with Coulombic efficiency maintaining at 98.5% and long service life of 800 cycles in full cells. Moreover, the electrode stability is well preserved even under harsh conditions of high temperature and ester-based electrolytes with higher reactivity.",

However, they are commonly characterized by rather poor cycling stability and low rate capability. Herein, we investigate CoS2, serving as a model compound. We synthesized a porous CoS2/C micro-polyhedron composite entangled in a carbon-nanotube-based network (CoS2-C/CNT), starting from zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-67 as a single precursor. Following an efficient two-step synthesis strategy, the obtained CoS2 nanoparticles are uniformly embedded in porous carbonaceous micro-polyhedrons, interwoven with CNTs to ensure high electronic conductivity. The CoS2-C/CNT nanocomposite provides excellent bifunctional energy storage performance, delivering 1030 mAh g-1 after 120 cycles and 403 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles (at 100 mA g-1) as electrode for lithium-ion (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), respectively. In addition to these high capacities, the electrodes show outstanding rate capability and excellent long-term cycling stability with a capacity retention of 80% after 500 cycles for LIBs and 90% after 200 cycles for SIBs. In situ X-ray diffraction reveals a significant contribution of the partially graphitized carbon to the lithium and at least in part also for the sodium storage and the report of a two-step conversion reaction mechanism of CoS2, eventually forming metallic Co and Li2S/Na2S. Particularly the lithium storage capability at elevated (dis-)charge rates, however, appears to be substantially pseudocapacitive, thus benefiting from the highly porous nature of the nanocomposite.",

        "abstract": "The application of small organic molecules for sodium‐ion batteries is generally plagued by their high solubility, poor conductivity, and sluggish redox dynamics in organic electrolyte, thus developing efficient strategies to restrain solubilization while obtaining fast charge transfer becomes a challenge. Herein, a rational hybridization strategy through hydrogen bond between organic molecule and inorganic substrate has been proposed, employing the terminal –C═O of trisodium 1, 2, 4‐benzenetricarboxylate (TBC) molecule and –OH groups of inorganic Ti3C2Tx MXene, respectively. In general, such a design evidently mitigates the aggregation of both TBC molecules and Ti3C2Tx MXene. Furthermore, the robust hydrogen bonding significantly mitigates the dissolution of TBC and guarantees the robust coupling between them, thus contributing to the integrity of electrode and modifying the electrochemical sodium storage in both half and full cells. Moreover, the systematic kinetic analysis and mechanism detection reveal improved charge transportation and robust two‐electron electrochemical reversibility of the hybrid TBC/Ti3C2Tx. Taken together, this work demonstrates a potential novel strategy toward stable and practical organic battery chemistries through hydrogen bonding with inorganic compounds.",

In this article, two PBAs samples with different particle dispersion were synthesized through sodium citrate-assisted co-precipitation method by means of staying and stirring. The influence of particle dispersion on electrochemical performance was investigated through polarization curve and AC impedance tests. It was found that PBAs with well-dispersed particles exhibited excellent rate performance, with a capacity of ~120 mAh g-1 at 1 C rate and a capacity retention of 75 % after 100 cycles. The capacity retention rate could reach 63 % at 5 C rate, far higher than that of PBAs samples with poor particle dispersion. From the perspective of electrochemical kinetics analysis, it has been shown that PBAs with well-dispersed particles exhibit smaller electrochemical polarization and faster Na+ diffusion reaction kinetics, which are key factors in achieving excellent rate performance.",

        "abstract": "Meeting the promise of all-solid-state batteries will require solid electrolytes that have high metal ion conductivity, low electronic conductivity, are electrochemically stable at both low and high potential, and have sufficiently high critical current density to avoid metal dendrite penetration. Metal borohydrides comprise a relatively new class of compounds that is being explored for its potential as a solid electrolyte material. Here, we examine the electrochemical thermodynamic stability of sodium amide borohydride (Na2NH2BH4, or NNB) over the potential range 1.5 to 5 V vs. Na/Na+, using electrodynamic methods, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization of the interfacial reaction products1, and electron microscopy characterization of microstructure. We observe the formation of a CEI layer that passivates the NNB electrolyte up to 5V, while the electrolyte is stable without needing additional passivation down to potentials as low as 1.5V. The onset potentials of the CEI formation reactions agree with those predicted by DFT2 and suggest that the resulting CEI is composed of closo-borohydrates, which are a type of metal borohydride with a cage-like structure that holds promise for high sodium ion conductivities3. XPS measurements of atomic compositions in the CEI layer show the formation of these closo-borohydrates and, coupled with charge transfer calculations, predict that the passivating CEI layer is thin (tens of nm). Impedance spectroscopy is performed to characterize the contribution of the CEI layer to the total cell resistance. Several formation cycling methods are explored to show that with appropriate cycling, the passivating layers contribute <10% to electrolyte resistance in the test cells.\n \n Acknowledgements: This work was supported as part of the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research, an Energy Innovation Hub funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences.\n \n References\n \n [1] Tushar Swamy, Xinwei Chen, and Yet-Ming Chiang, “Electrochemical Redox Behavior of Li-ion Conducting Sulfide Solid Electrolytes,” Chem.

        "abstract": "P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 (P2-NiMn) is one of the promising positive electrode materials for high-energy Na-ion batteries because of large reversible capacity and high working voltage by charging up to 4.5 V versus Na+/Na. However, the capacity rapidly decays during charge/discharge cycles, which is caused by the large volume shrinkage of ca. 23% by sodium deintercalation and following electric isolation of P2-NiMn particles in the composite electrode. Serious electrolyte decomposition at the higher voltage region than 4.1 V also brings deterioration of the particle surface and capacity decay during cycles. To solve these drawbacks, we apply water-soluble sodium poly-γ-glutamate (PGluNa) as an efficient binder to P2-NiMn instead of conventional poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVdF) and examined the electrode performances of P2-NiMn composite electrode with PGluNa binder for the first time. The PGluNa electrode shows Coulombic efficiency of 95% at the first cycle and capacity retention of 89% after 50 cycles, whereas the PVdF electrode exhibits only 80 and 71%, respectively. The alternating current impedance measurements reveal that the PGluNa electrode shows a much lower resistance during the cycles compared with the PVdF one. From the surface analysis and peeling test of the electrodes, the PGluNa binder was found to cover the surface of the P2-NiMn particles and suppresses the electrolyte decomposition and surface degradation. The PGluNa binder further enhance the mechanical strength of the electrodes and suppresses the electrical isolation of the P2-NiMn particles during sodium extraction/insertion. The efficient binder with noticeable adhesion strength and surface coverage of active materials and carbon has paved a new way to enhance the electrochemical performances of high-voltage positive electrode materials for Na-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The use of porous hard carbons (PHCs) as electrode materials in sodium-ion batteries has great potential; however, the exposure of large surface areas to electrolyte flow results in irregular and irreversible solid electrolyte interfaces (SEIs), leading to deteriorated ionic and electronic mobility and inferior initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). These issues can be addressed through suitable structural modifications of PHC materials. Herein, the integration of high-surface-area PHCs with carbon nanofibers (CNFs) was accomplished by a simple electrospinning technique, which resulted in a uniform and reversible SEI layer. In the meantime, the CNFs' mesh provided connectivity and conductivity in the as-integrated electrodes, whereas PHCs offered fast diffusion kinetics and high Na+ ion storage capacity. Additionally, PHC integration with CNFs demonstrated an excellent ICE of 77% and a specific capacity of 505 mAh/g at 25 mA/g. Furthermore, the conjugated microstructure also provided flexibility and stability to the electrode (260 mAh/g after 500 cycles). This remarkable synergy may promote the development of free-standing, flexible, and highly porous properties in a single material for advanced energy storage applications.",

In this study, we report the structure, morphology and conductivity of the earth-abundant Mn/Fe-based NASICON phosphate Na4MnFe(PO4)3. Pure phase powders were synthesized by solution-assisted solid-state reaction, sol–gel and Pechini methods.

The effect of synthesis method on microstructure and conductivity was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and impedance measurements. Smaller particle size and regular distribution of the powder was designed using a Pechini route. Impedance measurement showed a notable enhancement in conductivity, from 0.543 × 10−7 to 1.52 × 10−7 S cm−1 at 30 °C, when the powder synthesis method was altered from a solution-assisted solid-state reaction to the Pechini route, highlighting the remarkable effect of the synthesis method on conductivity.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon, characterized by high ion storage capacity, low operating voltage, and excellent cycling stability, is considered an ideal negative electrode material for sodium‐ion batteries. However, the high cost and low carbon yield of thermosetting precursors limit their practical application in SIBs, while low‐cost and high‐yield raw materials exhibit highly ordered carbon structures and narrow interlayer spacing under high‐temperature carbonization. Discarded polyimide materials are inexpensive, which offer a high carbon yield and possess good thermal stability and thermoplasticity, with functional groups of imide rings (−CO−N−CO−) on their main chains. This study recycled and converted polyimide materials into hard carbon materials from discarded engineering plastics, investigating the influence of carbonization temperature on the degree of graphitization, interlayer spacing, and pore structure of the materials to achieve high reversible sodium storage capacity. After carbonization at 1300 °C, the polyimide material exhibited 319 mAh g−1 reversible capacity and excellent electrochemical performance (with a capacity retention of 91.92 % after 100 cycles at a 0.5 C current rate) and rate performance (up to 242.5 mAh g−1 at 2 C).

It is discovered that Mo2AlB2 shows a higher specific capacity than MoAlB when used as an electrode material for LIBs, with a specific capacity of 593 mAh g−1 achieved after 500 cycles at 200 mA g−1. It is also found that surface redox reactions are responsible for Li storage in Mo2AlB2, instead of intercalation or conversion. Moreover, the sodium hydroxide treatment of MoAlB leads to a porous morphology and higher specific capacities exceeding that of pristine MoAlB. When tested in SIBs, Mo2AlB2 exhibits a specific capacity of 150 mAh g−1 at 20 mA g−1.

However, works involving TMD materials as electrodes for sodium- (NIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) are relatively few, mainly due to poor electrode performance arising from significant volume changes and pulverization by the larger size alkali-metal ions. Here, we show that Na+ and K+ cyclability in WS2 TMD is improved by introducing WS2 nanosheets in a chemically and mechanically robust matrix comprising precursor-derived ceramic (PDC) silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) material. The WS2/SiOC composite in fibermat morphology was achieved via electrospinning followed by thermolysis of a polymer solution consisting of a polysiloxane (precursor to SiOC) dispersed with exfoliated WS2 nanosheets. The composite electrode was successfully tested in Na-ion and K-ion half-cells as a working electrode, which rendered the first cycle charge capacity of 474.88 mAh g−1 and 218.91 mAh g−1, respectively. The synergistic effect of the composite electrode leads to higher capacity and improved coulombic efficiency compared to the neat WS2 and neat SiOC materials in these cells.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge on the formation of mixed transition metal layers on lithium and sodium transition metal oxides, Li/Na(Co,Ni,Mn,)O2, determines the ability to control their electrochemical properties as electrode materials in alkaline ion batteries. Taking this into account, herein we combine the EPR and 23Na MAS NMR spectroscopic techniques to gain insights into the structural peculiarities of the mixed cobalt-nickel-manganese layers of NayCo1-2xNixMnxO2 with a three-layer stacking (P3-type) structure. Two types of compositions are examined where diamagnetic Co3+ and paramagnetic Ni3+ and Mn4+ are stabilized: Na2/3Co1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2 and Na1/2Ni1/2Mn1/2O2. EPR spectroscopy operating in the X- and Q-band region is applied with an aim to improve the spectra resolution and, on the other hand, to provide straightforward information on the coordination of the transition metal ions inside the layers. The analysis of EPR spectra is based on the reference for the Mn4+ and Ni2+ ions occurring simultaneously in oxides with two layer stacking, P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2. Complementary to EPR, 23Na MAS NMR spectroscopy at high spinning rates is undertaken to assess the local structure of the Na nucleus in the layered P3-NayCo1-2xNixMnxO2 oxides. All results are discussed taking into account the EPR and NMR data for the well-known lithium analogues O3-LiCo1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2 and O3-LiNi1/2Mn1/2O2. Finally, the structure peculiarities of the transition metal layers extracted from the EPR and NMR methods are demonstrated by electrochemical intercalation of Li+ ions into P3-NayCo1-2xNixMnxO2.",

        "abstract": "Constructing hollow architectures based on metal sulfides is of great interest for high-performance electrode materials for sodium ion batteries due to their intriguring properties and various applications. However, the relatively low volumetric density and high fragile structure are the obstacles blocking the development of hollow-structured electrode materials. In this work, ball-in-ball structured (Ni0.33Co0.67)9S8@C nanospheres have been synthesized by using NiCo-glycerate as the precursor via solvothermal reaction, which was followed by a carbon coating treatment. In this structural design, hollow cavities are generated between the inner and outer balls to effectively accommodate the volume changes of the metal sulfides in the processes of charging/discharging, while the uniform carbon coating can increase the electrical conductivity and maintain the structural stability during repeated cycling. The Rietveld refinement, in situ X-ray diffraction, and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses provide evidence for an enlarged lattice parameter, weaker Co-S and Ni-S bonding, and a synergistic effect in the (Ni0.33Co0.67)9S8@C towards boosting the conversion reaction and reversible formation of sulfur in the fully charged state, with the sulfur trapped within the composite to additionally account for the superior cycling stability of this material. Capacitive behavior has been verified to dominate the electrochemical reaction, enabling fast charge transport kinetics. Impressively, the double structural protection combined with the free hollow space and complete carbon layer endows the (Ni0.33Co0.67)9S8@C nanospheres with good electrochemical performance, featuring high cyclability and good rate capability.",

However, equivalent negative electrode materials for complementary sodium ion battery (NIB) technologies are yet to be commercialized due to sluggish reaction kinetics, phase instability, and low energy density originating from the larger size of Na+-ion. Therefore, in search of the next-generation electrode materials for NIBs, we first analyze the failure of graphite during reversible Na+ ion storage. Building upon that, we suggest surface-functionalized and nanostructured forms of analogous carbon allotropes for enhancing Na+ ion storage. During long-term rigorous cycling conditions, Graphene Oxide (GO) and Graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) exhibit higher Na+ ion storage (157 mAh g−1 and 50 mAh g−1 after 60 cycles, respectively) compared to graphite (27 mAh g−1). Optimizing alternative NIBs requires a comprehensive analysis of cycling behavior and kinetic information. Therefore, in this investigation, we further examine ex-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at progressive cycles and correlate capacity degradation with impedance arising from the electrolyte, solid electrolyte interphase formation, and charge transfer.",

Framework Prussian blue analogs and dense niobium oxides have been identified as high-rate electrodes for sodium- and lithium-ion batteries, respectively, yet the origin of the extremely high solid-state Na+/Li+ transport is not fully understood. Of critical importance is the fact that their ultra-low activation energy and anomalous pre-exponent factor cannot be satisfactorily rationalized from conventional theory of solid-state diffusion in the crystal lattice. Here, assisted by density-functional-theory calculations, we argued that the true origin is a unique surface-like diffusion mechanism of the intercalation ions. In a surface-like migration event, a mobile ion moves along the channel wall via a low coordination number and low migration barrier experiencing minimal steric hindrance. It is similar to surface diffusion in the conventional picture and contrasts with lattice diffusion from one interstitial/vacancy site to another one with high coordination number, crowded saddle-point geometry and high migration barrier. The analogy to gas diffusion in molecular sieves shall be discussed. Additionally, the effects of defects and crystal water in Prussian blue analogs were also discussed for better understanding their rate performances in experimental scenarios.",

Five Na-carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binders with different molecular weights and degrees of substitution were investigated. The increase in the CMC molecular weight led to an increase in the volume of water necessary for slurry preparation and a decrease in the electrode mass loading. Moreover, the adhesion of the slurry was strongly impacted by the aluminum current collector properties. A high initial Coulombic efficiency, iCE (up to ∼90%), and reversible capacity (up to 334 mAh g-1 at C/10) were obtained in Na half-cells. Post-mortem XPS analyses performed on several electrodes under various conditions allowed a better understanding of the formation and composition of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. The genesis of SEI was initially chemically driven: to a small extent, by HC and to a greater extent, by the Na metal. However, SEI formation was mainly governed by the electrochemical-driven degradation of the electrolyte salt and solvent. The SEI layer composed of an inorganic-rich core and an organic-rich shell significantly decreased the resistance of the HC electrode, allowing superior iCE while maintaining high capacity retention (96.2%), after 100 cycles at 1C.",

However, the state-of-the-art separators cannot meet the engineering needs of large-scale sodium-ion batteries to match the intensively investigated electrode materials. Here, a kind of flexible modified cellulose acetate separator (MCA) for sodium-ion batteries was synthesized via the electrospinning process and subsequently optimizing the interface chemical groups by changing acetyl to hydroxyl partly. Upon the rational design, the flexible MCA separator exhibits high chemical stability and excellent wettability (contact angles nearly 0°) in electrolytes (EC/PC, EC/DMC, diglyme, and triglyme). Moreover, the flexible MCA separator shows high onset temperature of degradation (over 250 °C) and excellent thermal stability (no shrinkage at 220 °C). Electrochemical measurements, importantly, show that the Na-ion batteries with flexible MCA separator exhibit ultralong cycle life (93.78%, 10 000 cycles) and high rate capacity (100.1 mAh g-1 at 10 C) in the Na/Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) half cell (2.5-4.0 V) and good cycle performance (98.59%, 100 cycles) in the Na/SnS2 half cell (0.01-3 V), respectively. Moreover, the full cell (SnS2/NVP) with flexible MCA separator displays the capacity of 98 mAh g-1 and almost no reduction after 40 cycles at 0.118 A g-1. Thus, this work provides a kind of flexible modified cellulose acetate separator for Na-ion batteries with great potential for practical large-scale applications.",

        "title": "LiZnSO4F made in an ionic liquid: a ceramic electrolyte composite for solid-state lithium batteries.",
        "abstract": "The search for good solid electrolytes constitutes a major goal towards the development of safer lithium batteries. A few candidates do exist, but they suffer either from narrow electrochemical window stability or too low ionic conductivity. Herein we report the ionic-liquid-assisted synthesis of a novel LiZnSO4F fluorosulfate phase having a sillimanite LiTiOPO4-type structure, which on simply pressed samples shows a room-temperature ionic conductivity of 10 – 10 7 Scm 1 together with a 0–5 V electrochemical stability window range, while ionic-liquid-free LiZnSO4F shows an ionic conductivity four orders of magnitude lower (10 11 Scm ). While robustly reproducible but not yet fully understood, this finding offers new opportunities to tailor inorganic composites with higher ionic conductivity. The origin of such results is demonstrated to be rooted in a surface effect associated with the grafting of a lithium-containing ionic liquid layer. This finding opens up new opportunities for the design of ceramic composites with higher ionic conductivity and should serve as an impetus for further exploiting the chemistry of ionic liquid grafting on oxides. Renewable energy sources and electric automotive transportation are popular topics in today s energy-conscious society, hence placing rechargeable batteries as one of the major technological sciences in this new century. Advances in energy storage are a tribute to chemists abilities to design new and better materials. In the hunt for novel electrode materials, notions of sustainability must be considered. This is the reason why LiFePO4, which is made of inexpensive and abundant chemical elements, has attracted the attention of the research community despite its poor conducting properties. By particle downsizing and carbon nanocoating, LiFePO4/C composite overcomes transport limitations and is capable of reversibly and rapidly intercalating 0.9 Li (ca. 160 mA hg ) at a redox voltage of 3.43 V versus Li. Thus, it has become one of the most praised electrode materials for the next generation of rechargeable batteries for high-volume applications. Further exploring the chemistry of polyanionic-based insertion electrodes, we recently synthesized, by an ionothermal process, a novel 3.6 V LiFeSO4F electrode showing a reversible capacity nearing 140 mAh g 1 (theoretical capacity = 151 mAh g ), good rate capability, and cycling stability. This fluorosulfate was found to crystallize in a tavorite structure (space group P 1) with three-dimensional channels for Li diffusion as opposed to the one-dimensional channels in LiFePO4. Most likely, from the 3D versus 1D change in the conduction path, the use of LiFeSO4F powders will obviate the need for nanosizing or carbon coating, while the same cost and environmental advantages are maintained. Since our early report, we have considerably enlarged the fluorosulfate family with the discovery of AMSO4F (A = Li, Na and M = Co, Ni, Mn, etc.) homologues. This new family of materials, practically unknown a year ago, counts no less than 20 members showing related structures with either promising electrochemical or attractive ionic properties. Among them, the sodium-based 3d-metal fluorosulfates, which crystallize in a titanite structure (derived from the tavorite structure, space group P21/c) and have localized positions for the Na ions, were found to show a four-fold increase in ionic conductivity as compared to their Li-based counterparts on cold-pressed powders (10 7 S cm 1 for Na vs. 10 11 Scm 1 for Li at room temperature). While far from the hallmark solid-state electrolytes for future Li batteries such as Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAG), Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LAT), and Li3+xPO4 xNx (LIPON), which have room-temperature conductivities of 2.8 10 4 Scm , 10 3 S cm , and 10 6 S cm , respectively, such a finding was an impetus to look for further fluorosulfate members as part of the effort to develop new ceramic electrolyte materials with increased conductivity, thus allowing a switch from thin-film to bulk technology in all solid-state batteries. Besides high ionic conductivity, a pivotal figure of merit for solid-state electrolytes is the width of their electrochemical stability window. This window is limited for ionic conducting ceramics containing 3d-metal elements, such as Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3, owing to the reduction of Ti 4+ in Ti at approximately 2.4 V. So our strategy was to search for other members of the fluorosulfate AMSO4F family containing divalent metals that cannot be easily reduced or oxidized. Besides LiMgSO4F, the first reported fluorosulfate, [7] other attractive candidates could enlist lead, tin, or zinc to prepare AMSO4F phases. Mindful of the previously reported struc[*] Dr. P.

        "abstract": "TiO2 has drawn increasing research attention as negative electrode material in sodium ion battery because of its natural abundance, low cost, nontoxicity, and facile preparation. Despite tremendous studies carried out, the sodium storage mechanism is still under discussion, and the electronic and local structures of TiO2 during sodiation/desodiation process are not well understood either. Herein, we reported a mechanism study of graphene-supported oxygen-deficient anatase TiO2 nanotubes (nanowires) as the negative electrode material for sodium ion batteries. Different from the previous reports, the insertion/extraction of Na+ ions leads to almost no changes of titanium valence state but there is a charge redistribution of O 2p orbitals which alters the hybridization between O 2p and Ti 3d states, suggested by the combined electrochemical and X-ray spectroscopic study. Both the electronic and local structures of TiO2 during the reversible sodiation/desodiation process are revealed from the Ti L-edge and O K-edge spectra. This detailed study would shed light on the material design and structural optimization of TiO2 as energy storage material in different systems.",

        "abstract": "FeS2 is a promising electrode material for alkali metal ion storage due to its high theoretical capacity. However, it still faces critical issues such as suboptimal rate and cycling performances owing to sluggish charge transport and significant volume variations. Herein, we constructed FeS2 (m-FeS2) and pyrite FeS2 (p-FeS2) nanocomposites embedded in N,S-doped carbon nanoboxes (m/p-FeS2@NSCN) to conquer such challenges. The microstructure design of nanoboxes effectively alleviates the stress caused by the volume expansion of FeS2 during lithiation processes, thereby improving the cycling stability of the FeS2 electrode. The marcasite/pyrite compositing design further increases the electronic conductivity of FeS2 and optimizes ion migration. As expected, the target m/p-FeS2@NSCN exhibits improved rate capability (595.5 mA h g-1 at 5.0 A g-1) and robust cycling stability (500 cycles without significant capacity decay at 0.1 A g-1) in lithium-ion batteries. Furthermore, m/p-FeS2@NSCN also shows excellent battery performances and potential application prospects in the field of sodium-ion batteries. It achieves a capacity of 355 mA h g-1 at 10.0 A g-1 and sustains 800 cycles without noticeable capacity decay at 0.5 A g-1.

        "abstract": "Technological advancement has been revolutionized by rechargeable batteries, without which the use of various modern devices would not be possible. Aqueous Na ion batteries have lately garnered much attention, being recognized as a promising alternative to the commonly used Li ion batteries for the large-scale energy storage systems. However, further improvement and optimization of such systems require a more detailed understanding of intercalation mechanisms. In this work, we for the first time demonstrate the implementation of the laser-induced current transient (LICT) technique for in situ characterization of battery systems and investigate the interface between Na2Ni[Fe(CN)6] model battery electrodes and aqueous electrolytes in contact with aqueous electrolytes. Quite counterintuitively, the LICT method revealed that at the quasi-steady-state the electrode surface stays positively charged within the potential range where the intercalation/deintercalation of sodium as well as of potassium is possible, evidencing that the intercalation mechanism of the alkali-metal cations should be rather complex. Furthermore, the specific shape of the observed current transients indicates that the interfacial processes of intercalation/deintercalation have at least three different relaxation time constants. The relaxation behavior is highly influenced by the nature of the alkali-metal cations-most likely through their different solvation energy. In addition, we outline how the laser-based experiments can intensify detailed in situ investigations of battery systems.",

        "title": "Beyond lithium-ion batteries: Are effective electrodes possible for alkaline and other alkali elements? Exploring ion intercalation in surface-modified few-layer graphene and examining layer quantity and stages",
        "abstract": "In the pursuit of reliable energy storage solutions, the significance of engineering electrodes cannot be overstated. Previous research has explored the use of surface modifiers (SMs), such as single-side fluorinated graphene, to enhance the thermodynamic stability of ion intercalation when applied atop few-layer graphene (FLG). As we seek alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), earth-abundant elements like sodium and potassium have emerged as promising candidates. However, a comprehensive investigation into staging intercalation has been lacking thus far. By delving into staging assemblies, we have uncovered a previously unknown intercalation site that offers the most energetically favorable binding. Here, we study the first three elements in both alkali (Li, Na, K) and alkaline (Be, Mg, Ca) earth metals. Furthermore, the precise mechanism underlying this intercalation system has remained elusive in prior studies. In our work, we employed density functional theory calculations with advanced hybrid functionals to determine the electrical properties at various stages of intercalation. This approach has been proven to yield more accurate and reliable electrical information. Through the analysis of projecting density of states and Mulliken population, we have gained valuable insights into the intricate interactions among the SM, ions, and FLG as the ions progressively insert into the structures. Notably, we expanded our investigation beyond lithium and explored the effectiveness of the SM on ions with varying radii and valence, encompassing six alkali and alkaline earth metals. Additionally, we discovered that the number of graphene layers significantly influences the binding energy. Our findings present groundbreaking concepts for material design, offering diverse and economically viable alternatives to LIBs. Furthermore, they serve as a valuable reference for fine-tuning electrical properties through staging intercalation and the application of SMs.",

Vat photopolymerization (VPP) 3D printing process is employed to manufacture gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), while direct ink writing process is used to prepare positive electrodes. The sodium-ion chemistry has proven to be an adequate substitute to lithium-ion due to the availability of resources and their potential lower production cost and enhanced safety. Three-dimensional printing technologies have the potential to revolutionize the production of shape-conformable batteries with intricate geometries that have been demonstrated to increase the specific surface area of the electrode and ion diffusion, thus leading to improved power performances. This study shows the preparation of composite UV-photocurable resins with different polymer matrix-to-liquid electrolyte ratios, designed to act as GPEs once printed via VPP. The impact of the liquid electrolyte ratio within the GPEs is thoroughly examined through a variety of electrochemical techniques. The exposure time printing parameter is optimized to ensure adequate print accuracy of the GPE. Using the optimized resin composition as material feedstock, shape-conformable 3D printed GPE exhibiting an ionic conductivity of 3.3 × 10−3 S·cm−1 at room temperature and a stability window up to 4.8 V vs. Na0/Na+ is obtained.

Likewise, in a rate capability test at 61st cycle (at 50 mA.g−1), the KIB-half cells yielded charge capacity of 172 mAh.g−1 versus 137 mAh.g−1 of SIB-half cells. The superior electrochemical performance of Td-WTe2 electrode material in KIB-half cells is explained based on the concept of Stokes’ radius—smaller desolvation activation energy resulted in higher mobility of potassium-ions in PC-based electrolyte. In addition, the likely mechanisms of electrochemical insertion and extraction of Na- and K-ions in Td-WTe2 are also discussed.",

By means of a preparation process free of solvents, catalysts, purification steps, and separation steps, it is possible to obtain a three-dimensional polymeric network capable of efficient sodium-ion transport. The thermal properties of the resulting solid electrolyte separator, characterized by means of thermogravimetric and calorimetric techniques, are excellent for use in sustainable energy systems conceived for safe large-scale grid storage. The photopolymerized electrolyte shows a wide electrochemical stability window up to 4.8 V versus Na/Na(+) along with the highest ionic conductivity (5.1 mS cm(-1) at 20 °C) obtained in the field of Na-ion polymer batteries so far and stable long-term constant-current charge/discharge cycling. Moreover, the polymeric networks are also demonstrated for the in situ fabrication of electrode/electrolyte composites with excellent interfacial properties, which are ideal for all-solid-state, safe, and easily upscalable device assembly.",

Within the confinement of hard carbon shells, SWCNTB can produce radially elastic deformation to accommodate the volume change of SnO2 during Li+ /Na+ insertion/extraction. This overcomes the problem of strain fracturing of the outer carbon shell, as well as maintains close electrical contact between SnO2 and the conductive network.

Our model is applied to understand the effects of crystal water on sodium ion intercalation in a tunnel manganese oxide structure, and we predict that precisely controlling the crystal water concentration can optimize the ion intercalation voltage and capacity and promote stable cycling. The analysis yields a critical structural water concentration by accounting for the interplay between elastic and electrostatic contributions to the free energy.

Herein, phosphoric acid (H3PO4) was used as the exchanger and hydrogen ions provider, the oxidant (K2S2O8) activity was driven by heating, the raw material structure was deformed and adjusted by the oxidizing drive, and lithium was exhausted, while manganese was converted into manganese(III) phosphate hydrate and manganese dioxide insoluble material.

The X-ray diffraction, X-ray spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry measurements were used to investigate the influence of oxidation driving force and lithium leaching. Finally, the lithium leach solution was continuously stirred with sodium carbonate in boiling water to obtain the precipitate, which was separated and washed several times to obtain high-purity lithium carbonate.",

        "abstract": "There is a crucial need for low-cost energy storage technology based on abundant sodium ions to realize sustainable development with renewable energy resources. Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) is applied as a binder in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, PVDF is also known to suffer from a larger irreversible capacity, especially when PVDF is used as the binder of negative electrode materials. In this research, a poly(acrylonitrile)-grafted poly(vinyl alcohol) copolymer (PVA-g-PAN) is tested as a binder with Ti-based layered oxides as potential negative electrode materials for SIBs. The chemical stability tests of PVDF and PVA-g-PAN contacted with metallic sodium have been conducted, which reveals that PVDF experiences a defluorination process, while PVA-g-PAN demonstrates excellent chemical stability. Composite electrodes with PVA-g-PAN demonstrate superior electrochemical performances when compared with the PVDF binder, allowing improvement for initial CE, higher rate capability, and long cyclability over 1500 cycles. Detailed characterization of electrodes via soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy demonstrates that the PVA-g-PAN branched structure allows a more uniform distribution of acetylene black with higher coatability, unlocking enhanced rate performances and efficient passivation of Ti-based oxides without the excessive electrolyte decomposition.

Here, an elaborate self-branched 2D SnS2 (B-SnS2) nanoarray electrode is designed by a facile hot bath method for Na storage. This interesting electrode exhibits areal reversible capacity of ca. 3.7 mAh cm-2 (900 mAh g-1) and rate capability of 1.6 mAh cm-2 (400 mAh g-1) at 40 mA cm-2 (10 A g-1). Improved extrinsic pseudocapacitive contribution is demonstrated as the origin of fast kinetics of an alloying-based SnS2 electrode. Sodiation dynamics analysis based on first-principles calculations, ex-situ HRTEM, in situ impedance, and in situ Raman technologies verify the S-edge effect on the fast Na+ migration and reversible and sensitive structure evolution during high-rate charge/discharge. The excellent alloying-based pseudocapacitance and unsaturated edge effect enabled by self-branched surface nanoengineering could be a promising strategy for promoting development of SIBs with both high capacity and high rate response.",

        "title": "Sodium-Beta Alumina and Its Application in a Novel Sodium-Based Solid-State Cell Concept",
        "abstract": "Post-Li-ion technologies are inevitable for solving problems connected to Li-ion cells, namely shortage of raw materials and physicochemical limits in energy density. Substitution of lithium with sodium while simultaneously replacing the liquid electrolyte with a ceramic solid electrolyte is a promising alternative.1\n \n Sodium-beta alumina is a solid-state electrolyte with outstanding chemical, electrochemical, and mechanical properties.2 So far, high-temperature cells have been using it as a solid electrolyte.3,4 However, we recently showed that the sodium-ion conducting sodium-beta alumina solid electrolyte (BASE) is also a suitable solid electrolyte for solid-state cells operating at middle- to low temperatures. We present methods commonly used to reduce the area-specific capacity at the interfaces, stemming from the poor interaction of the rigid solid electrolyte with its adjacent electrodes. Hence, we tackle the bottleneck of middle- to low-temperature solid-state cell systems utilizing BASE, leading to enhanced cell performance.2\n \n To increase the electrochemical performance, adjusting BASE´s properties is necessary. We showed that 3d transition metal doping tunes BASE´s properties effectively. For example, Ti4+ doping assisted a liquid sintering process, which changed the microstructure. Thus, BASE´s ionic conductivity increased by 50%. Simultaneously, we increased BASE´s fracture strength while reducing energy costs.5 Furthermore, we demonstrate the importance of proper storage conditions. We elucidate the effect of humidity on disk-shaped samples of Li-stabilized sodium-beta alumina and quantify the negative consequences of improper storage for cell systems using sodium-beta alumina. Despite detrimental effects on ionic conductivity and the chemical composition, the critical current density collapsed from the maximum of 9.1 mA cm-2, one of the highest values reported for sodium-beta alumina, to only 1.7 mA cm-2 at 25 °C. We show how impedance analysis and additional characterizations assist in clarifying occurring degradation mechanisms, namely ion exchange and subsequent buildup of surface layers.6\n \n Combining the knowledge from previous works, we provide a proof-of-concept for a novel sodium-based solid-state cell concept utilizing sodium-beta alumina. We use sodium metal as the negative electrode, which is necessary to achieve high specific energy and the requirement to compete with existing cell systems. An environmentally friendly transition metal oxide positive electrode with high specific energy is paired with the negative electrode. A composite positive electrode ensures intra-electrode conduction while enabling a facile charge transfer due to an intimate electrolyte–electrode interface contact, leading to stable cycling over 50 cycles with good energy retention. We think that the proof-of-concept opens the door for dozens of new material combinations and enhances the utilization of sodium-beta alumina in medium- to low-temperature solid-state cell systems.\n All in all, the presentation points out the excellent performance and the enormous potential of sodium-beta alumina for sodium-based energy storage technologies.\n References \n \n Janek, J. & Zeier, W.

        "abstract": "The upcoming energy transition requires not only renewable energy sources but also novel electricity storage systems such as batteries. Despite Li-ion batteries being the main storage systems, other batteries have been proposed to fulfil the requirements on safety, costs, and resource availability. Moving away from lithium, materials such as sodium, magnesium, zinc, and calcium are being considered. Water-based electrolytes are known for their improved safety, environmentally friendliness, and affordability. The key, however, is how to utilize the negative metal electrode, as using water-based electrolytes with these metals becomes an issue with respect to oxidation and/or dendrite formation. This work studied magnesium, where we aimed to determine if it can be electrochemically deposited in aqueous solutions with alginate-based additives to protect the magnesium. In order to do so, atomic force microscopy was used to research the morphological structure of magnesium deposition at the local scale by using a probe—the tip of a cantilever—as the active electrode, during charging and discharging. The second goal of using the AFM probe technology for magnesium deposition and stripping was an extension of our previous study in which we investigated, for lithium, whether it is possible to measure ion current and perform nonfaradaic impedance measurements at the local scale. The work presented here shows that this is possible in a relatively simple way because, with magnesium, no dendrite formation occurs, which hinders the stripping process.",

The as‐prepared TiS2 demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 1040 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 with the capacity contribution of 521 mA h g−1 in the voltage region below 1.0 V (vs Na/Na+), remarkable initial coulombic efficiency of 95.9% and superior rate capability of 621 mA h g−1 at 40 A g−1. The high conductivity of the Ti‐based compounds and nanosized particles generated by chemical conversion reactions could minimize the entropic barrier for the reversible conversion, resulting in high reversibility and ultrafast charge/discharge ability of the electrode. Moreover, with its strong ability to adsorb soluble polysulfide intermediates, the as‐prepared TiS2 electrode exhibits superior cycling stability over 9000 cycles, serving as a stable and ultra‐high capacity conversion electrode for NIBs.",

The hybrid device (HAC||EMD) can possess excellent electrochemical performance metrics, having a high energy density of 38 Wh/kg at a power density of 761 W/kg. Overall, this study provides insights into the influence of the activation temperature and the KOH impregnation ratio on morphology, porosity distribution, and the activated carbon's electrochemical properties with faster kinetics.

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) metal sulfides show great promises for their potential applications as electrode materials of sodium ion batteries because of the weak interlayer van der Waals interactions which allow the reversible accommodation and extraction of sodium ions. The sodiation of metal sulfides can undergo a distinct process compared to that of lithiation, which is determined by their metal and structural types. However, the structural and morphological evolution during its electrochemical sodiation is still unclear. Here, we studied the sodiation reaction dynamics of TiS2 by employing in situ transmission electron microscopy and first-principles calculations. During the sodium ion intercalation process, we observed multiple intermediate phases (phase II, phase Ib, and phase Ia), different from its lithiation counterpart, with varied sodium occupation sites and interlayer stacking sequences. Further insertion of Na ions prompted a multi-step extrusion reaction which led to the phase separation of Ti metal from the Na2S matrix, with its 2D morphology expanded to a 3D morphology. In contrast to regular conversion electrodes, TiS2 still maintained a compacted structure after a full sodiation. Frist-principles calculations reveal that the as-identified phases are thermodynamically preferred at corresponding intercalation/extrusion stages compared to other possible phases. The present work provides the fundamental mechanistic understanding of the sodiation process of 2D transition metal sulfides.",

From the cyclic voltammograms, both lithium ion and sodium ion can reversibly insert into/from CNSs in all of the electrolytes used here. The cycling stability of CNSs in concentrated electrolytes was better than that in dilute electrolytes for the SIB system. The interfacial charge-transfer resistances at the interface between CNSs and organic electrolytes were evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. In the Nyquist plots, the semicircles at the middle-frequency region were assigned to the parallel circuits of charge-transfer resistances and capacitances. The interfacial sodium-ion transfer resistances in concentrated organic electrolytes were much smaller than those in dilute electrolytes, and the rate capability of CNS electrodes in sodium salt-concentrated electrolytes might be better than in dilute electrolytes, suggesting that CNSs with concentrated electrolytes are the candidate of SIB negative electrode materials with high rate capability.

In this study, we synthesized Na1-2yCay[Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3]O2 with y=0 and 0.02, and studied their structural stability towards ambient exposure. Na0.96Ca0.02[Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3]O2 demonstrated excellent air stability by retaining 0.93 of lattice Na in the original O3 structure after 6 days of ambient storage. Titration experiments confirmed that the presence of Ca in Na0.96Ca0.02[Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3]O2 effectively suppressed the otherwise rigorous Na+/H+ ion exchange in the presence of water. Charge/discharge cycling in half cells suggested that Ca improved the active material’s specific capacity and capacity retention by retaining its structural integrity and eliminating surface impurity formation during ambient electrode processing. Finally, the cycling performance of Na0.96Ca0.02[Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3]O2/hard carbon full cells was evaluated with upper cut-off voltages of 4.0 V and 4.1 V. Raising the upper cut-off voltage to 4.1 V resulted in a 20% gain in specific energy, but also accelerated capacity fade and voltage polarization, most likely due to an irreversible phase transition above 4.0 V.",

For the layered structures, we provide an overarching view of intercalant orderings in prismatic coordination based on antiphase boundaries, which has important consequences for diffusion. We examine details of stacking sequence transitions between different layered structures by calculating stacking fault energies and discussing the nature of dislocations.

Its maximum capacity reaches 751 mA h g−1 for Na-ion batteries or 250 mA h g−1 for K-ion batteries, and the diffusion barrier is only 0.027 eV for the Na atom or 0.127 eV for the K atom. The small lattice changes, high storage capacity, metallic feature, and extremely low ion diffusion barriers make the ReN2 monolayers a superior electrode material for Na-ion rechargeable batteries with ultrafast charging/discharging processes.",

Although the technology has the potential for high energy density, unresolved technical difficulties pose a challenge. Fortunately, progress is made in improving electrode materials, with studies demonstrating that controlling the fundamental cause of electrolyte degradation can significantly enhance the performance of potassium‐ion batteries. However, the ability of ether‐based electrolytes to improve battery performance is overlooked despite their inherent characteristics. This work explores the role and principles of ether‐based electrolytes in enhancing the potential of potassium‐ion batteries, highlighting various controversies and prospects in this area arising from insufficient research.",

However, the application of both SIBs and PIBs are hindered by the lack of suitable electrode materials. Here, we synthesized the sulfur decorated Ti3 C2 Tx (S-T3 C2 Tx ) MXene as electrode material for SIBs and PIBs. Thanks to the sulfur functional group and the formation of Ti-S bond, which facilitates the sodium in-/desertion and strengthens the potassium ion adsorption ability, as well as enhances ion reaction kinetics and improved structure stability, the S-T3 C2 Tx exhibit excellent sodium/potassium storage performance, high reversible capacities of 151 and 101 mAh g-1 at 0.1 mA g-1 were achieved for SIBs and PIBs, respectively. Moreover, the S-T3 C2 Tx exhibits remarkable long-term capacity stability at a high density of 500 mA g-1 , providing an impressive storage of 88 mAh g-1 for SIBs and 41 mAh g-1 for PIBs even after 2000 cycles.

        "abstract": "The electrochemical intercalation/deintercalation of solvated sodium ions into graphite is a highly reversible process, but leads to large, undesired electrode expansion/shrinkage (“breathing”). Herein, two strategies to mitigate the electrode expansion are studied. Starting with the standard configuration (−) sodium | diglyme (2G) electrolyte | graphite (poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) binder) (+), the PVDF binder is first replaced with a binder made of the sodium salt of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Second, ethylenediamine (EN) is added to the electrolyte solution as a co‐solvent. The electrode breathing is followed in situ (operando) through electrochemical dilatometry (ECD). It is found that replacing PVDF with CMC is only effective in reducing the electrode expansion during initial sodiation. During cycling, the electrode breathing for both binders is comparable. Much more effective is the addition of EN. The addition of 10 v/v EN to the diglyme electrolyte strongly reduces the electrode expansion during the initial sodiation (+100% with EN versus +175% without EN) as well as the breathing during cycling. A more detailed analysis of the ECD signals reveals that solvent co‐intercalation temporarily leads to pillaring of the graphite lattice and that the addition of EN to 2G leads to a change in the sodium storage mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Sodium (Na)-ion batteries are the most explored 'beyond-Li' battery systems, yet their energy densities are still largely limited by the positive electrode material. Na3FeF6 is a promising Earth-abundant containing electrode and operates through a conversion-type charge-discharge reaction associated with a high theoretical capacity (336 mA h g-1). In practice, however, only a third of this capacity is achieved during electrochemical cycling. In this study, we demonstrate a new rapid and environmentally-friendly assisted-microwave method for the preparation of Na3FeF6. A comprehensive understanding of charge-discharge processes and of the reactivity of the cycled electrode samples is achieved using a combination of electrochemical tests, synchrotron X-ray diffraction, 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, magnetometry, and 23Na/19F solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) complemented with first principles calculations of NMR properties. We find that the primary performance limitation of the Na3FeF6 electrode is the sluggish kinetics of the conversion reaction, while the methods employed for materials synthesis and electrode preparation do not have a significant impact on the conversion efficiency and reversibility. Our work confirms that Na3FeF6 undergoes conversion into NaF and Fe(s) nanoparticles. The latter are found to be prone to oxidation prior to ex situ measurements, thus necessitating a robust analysis of the stable phases (here, NaF) formed upon conversion.",

Nevertheless, a previous study showed that multivalent Mg2+ ions cannot reversibly insert into MXene, resulting in a negligible capacity. Here, we demonstrate a simple strategy to achieve high magnesium storage capability for Ti3C2 MXene by preintercalating a cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Density functional theory simulations verify that intercalated CTA+ cations reduce the diffusion barrier of Mg2+ on the MXene surface, resulting in the significant improvement of the reversible insertion/deinsertion of Mg2+ ions between MXene layers. Consequently, the MXene electrode exhibits a desirable volumetric specific capacity of 300 mAh cm-3 at 50 mA g-1 as well as outstanding rate performance. This work endows MXene material with an application in electrochemical energy storage and, simultaneously, introduces magnesium battery materials as a member.",

It was found that the first sodiation process occurred in two steps; that is, the crystalline Sn nanoparticles were initially sodiated via a two-phase mechanism with a migrating phase boundary to form a Na-poor, amorphous Na(x)Sn alloy (x ~ 0.5), which was further sodiated to several Na-rich amorphous phases and finally to the crystallized Na(15)Sn(4) (x = 3.75) via a single-phase mechanism. The volumetric expansion was about 60% in the first step and 420% after the second step. However, despite the huge expansion, cracking or fracture was not observed, which is attributed to the second step of the single-phase sodiation that accommodates large portion of the sodiation-induced stress over the entire particle. Excellent cyclability was also observed during the reversible sodiation/desodiation cycles, showing great potential of Sn nanoparticles as a robust electrode material for rechargeable batteries.",

Hence, we have developed a facile process to fabricate powder exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets capable of large-scale production and having highly monolayer-rich structures. This process contains two steps: liquid-phase exfoliation of the edge-rich MoS2 precursor and a freeze-drying procedure. The proposed MoS2 precursors contain rich edge fractions that are easily exfoliated by this method, and the freeze-drying procedure can maintain the unique monolayer-rich structure of MoS2 in the powder phase. The electrochemical evaluations of both lithium- and sodium-ion batteries reveal that the proposed powder exfoliated monolayer-rich MoS2 electrode exhibits remarkable specific capacities and stable cyclic performances. In particular, the monolayer-rich MoS2 nanosheet electrode delivers a superior lithium-storage capacity of ∼1400 mA h g-1. The exfoliated MoS2 nanosheet electrode can withstand over 1000 cycles even at 1 A g-1. The mechanism reveals that these unique MoS2 nanosheets not only have a large surface area but also their inclusive monolayer structures exhibit much higher charge mobility than those of bulk MoS2.",

        "title": "(Invited) Optimizing the Binder Distribution in Battery Electrodes with Manufacturing Process Simulations and Machine Learning",
        "abstract": "The performance of lithium-ion battery cells strongly depends on the microstructure of the electrodes, which is determined by the spatial distribution of the active material, carbon additive, binder, and pores within the electrode volume. The manufacturing process determines this spatial distribution, which, in turn, determines the interfaces between these materials and the pores, thereby impacting the practical properties of the electrodes, such as their electrical conductivity, energy density, and wettability. The binder plays a crucial role in this process, as its spatial distribution controls the degree of percolation between the particles and the adhesion of the electrode with the current collector.\n Since 2017, we have been developing the ARTISTIC computational platform,1 which constitutes a digital twin of the battery electrode and cell manufacturing process. Supported by a combination of physics-based models and machine learning, this platform has been demonstrated by us for lithium-ion, sodium-ion, and solid-state batteries with electrodes produced by wet processing.2 The platform simulates each step of the manufacturing process, including mixing, coating/drying, calendering, electrolyte infiltration, and resulting cell performance. It allows for predicting 3D-resolved electrode and cell sandwich microstructures with their associated electrochemical performance as a function of the manufacturing parameters.\n In this talk, I will discuss how the ARTISTIC computational platform can optimize the spatial distribution of active material, carbon additive, and binder within the electrode volume. Using Bayesian Optimization, the platform predicts the manufacturing parameters required to obtain optimal electrodes in terms of several properties, such as electric conductivity, tortuosity factor, electroactive surface area, and energy density. I will particularly discuss the platform's capabilities to capture the adhesion of the electrode with the current collector through the binder. Additionally, I will present an extension of this digital twin for the 3D-resolved simulation of the dry processing of active material, carbon additive, and binder based on extrusion and compare the results (in the form of 3D-resolved electrode microstructures) with experimental data. Results from the wet and dry processing simulations will be discussed for electrodes made with different active material chemistries, such as NMC and LFP, and the crucial role of the binder in the heterogeneity of lithiation/delithiation of the electrodes upon their electrochemical cycling will be explored.\n Finally, building on our previously reported virtual reality digital tools for battery manufacturing,3 I will present a novel virtual reality interface that allows for the interactive and immersive use of the ARTISTIC computational platform to track the influence of manufacturing parameters on the active material, carbon additive, and binder's spatial location, as well as the resulting electrode properties. I will conclude by discussing why this virtual interface is also a powerful tool to assist in the electrode manufacturing optimization.\n \n References\n \n \n 1.

It should be noted that the cycle performance of the PhQ/SWCNT electrode is much better than that of PhQ encapsulated in SWCNT (PhQ@SWCNT). We also calculated molecular base reaction energies by density functional theory calculations to gain a qualitative insight into the observed discharge potentials of the PhQ/SWCNT electrode.",

        "abstract": "Cobalt sulfides have been popularly used in energy storage field because of its high theoretical capacity and rich redox reactions. However, the issues of poor reaction kinetics, rapid capacity decay and severe polarization due to volume changes during electrochemical reaction are still huge challenges for cobalt sulfides in practical applications. Herein, we have synthesized cobalt sulfides yolk-shell spheres by phosphorus doping (P-CoS) to stabilize the structure of cobalt sulfides and improve its electronic/ion conductivity. Kinetic tests and density functional theory calculations confirm that the introduction of phosphorus into cobalt sulfides greatly reduces the diffusion barrier of Li + in the intrinsic structure, thereby improving the reaction kinetics of electrode materials during the Li +  insertion/extraction process. In consequence, the P-CoS electrode delivers a high lithium storage capacity (781 mAh g -1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 A g -1 ), outstanding rate capability (489 mAh g -1 at 10 A g -1 ) and good long-term cycling stability (no obvious capacity decay over 4000 cycles at 5 A g -1 ). Especially for the sodium-ion batteries application, the P-CoS yolk-shell spheres show a remarkably reversible capacity of about 260 mAh g -1 at 2 A g -1 after 900 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Sodium titanium oxide with spinel-type structure is suitable for stable sodium-intercalation host for negative electrode of sodium-ion batteries, as like the spinel-type lithium titanium oxide (Li4Ti5O12, LTO) material for lithium-ion batteries. Recently, this have been partly discovered as Na3LiTi5O12 (NTO) phase in the Li4Ti5O12 particle. However, the single-phase NTO material have never been obtained, preventing accurate material characterizations and applications. Here, we successfully realized the NTO material with single-phase by chemical sodium insertion-extraction process. The chemical sodium-inserted LTO material is well converted to pure NTO phase in the single particle level, via following chemical oxidation by water. The purified material was about 97 mol % of NTO as single-phase spinel structure with a = 8.746 Å. The basic lattice framework of prepared NTO was confirmed as same as the LTO. The single-phase NTO electrode show 0.8 V vs Na+/Na of Na-insertion and extraction potential, and 99.4 % of Na-insertion capacity with 99.7 % of coulombic efficiency during 200 cycles of Na-ion half-cell experiment. Further, the Na2Fe2(SO4)3 / NTO full-cell shows 3 V-class stable charge-discharge character during 100 cycles. These excellent stability of Na-insertion and extraction properties of single-phase NTO extends the range of constructing safe and stable high-voltage oxide-based sodium-ion battery cells in practical use.",

The compatibility of various binders with the ionic liquid electrolyte is evaluated, and interaction between various binders and graphite particles before and after cycling is compared and discussed. The results demonstrate that the well compatibility of Na-Alg in ionic liquids and its reasonable distribution on the graphite surface facilitate fast charge transfer and ion diffusion, reduce electrode polarization, and thus contributing to significantly improved cycling stability and rate capability of AIBs.

The introduced Na2S can act as not only a sulfur dopant, but also as a highly efficient reducing agent in the formation of S-RGO sheets, which dramatically improves the electrical conductivities of the resulting S-RGO sheets compared with previous reports. The current reaches about 50.0 mA at an applied bias of 2.0 V for the optimized sample with 2.22 at% sulfur doping. This current value is much higher than that of RGO sheets (∼1.2 mA) annealed at 200 °C, and very close to that of single-layer graphene sheets (∼68.0 mA) prepared using chemical vapor deposition under the same test conditions. The resulting highly conductive S-RGO sheets offer many promising technological applications such as efficient metal-free electrocatalysts in oxygen reduction reactions in fuel cells and as supercapacitor electrode materials for high-performance Li-ion batteries.",

Calculated results show a direct relationship between the size of the M2+ cation and lattice parameters as well as the defect formation energy variation. The NaCl Schottky defect type is highly favourable, and the Na6BaCl8 structure possesses the lowest values of defect formation energies. These structures are predicted to be mechanically stable and ductile, implying their compatibility with possible use as electrodes/electrolytes. The Na6MCl8 structures exhibit semiconductor characteristics with an energy gap ranging between 4.1–4.6 eV, which differs from the previous value of Na6MgCl8. A 3D migration pathway is identified in each rock-salt structure. Despite the small variation of the Na diffusivity and conductivity at 250 K within the structures considered, the Na6BaCl8 is characterized by the highest conductivity at 250 K, while the Na6MgCl8 structure has the highest conductivity and diffusivity values. The outstanding properties predicted for a Na ion battery suggest future development of synthetic strategies for their actual preparation.",

        "title": "Fabrication of Na+-Conducting Ionic Liquids Na[((FSO2)2n)\n x\n ((CF3SO2)(FSO2)N)1-X\n ], and Its Physical and Electrochemical Properties",
        "abstract": "To achieve low-carbon society in near future, it’s imperative to research and develop high-performance and low-cost batteries. Therefore, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are attracting attention owing to their possibility to be composed of elements with no resource scarcity and low cost.To solve the challenge of low energy density in SIBs, it is essential to focus on developing electrodes of the 4V to 5V class. Simultaneously, electrolytes with wide electrochemical window are crucial from in terms of electrolyte decomposition at high operating voltages. Molten salt electrolytes exhibit relatively high ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. On the other hands, there is an issue that the electrolyte must be heated to a high temperature to maintain molten state of the electrolytes. In this study, with the goal of expanding the melting temperature range of molten salt electrolytes, we precisely mixed relatively low-melting sodium salts Na(FSO2)2N (NaFSA) and Na(CF3SO2)(FSO2)N (NaFTA) and found a composition with a melting point below 100 ℃. As a result, we successfully fabricated novel single-sodium cationic salt ionic liquid. In this presentation, we will report on its bulk properties and electrochemical characteristics.\n All mixed sodium salts were mixed NaFSA and NaFTA in each molar ratio and stirred during gradually cooling after uniformly melting at 170 ℃ in Ar-filled grove box. The thermal properties of the mixed sodium salts were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The samples were stored at room temperature for 2~3 days to reach equilibrium state, and then sealed in a high-pressure SUS pan. Ionic conductivity (σ) of the mixed sodium salts were also measured from 60 ℃ to 135 ℃ at each temperature. Symmetrical cells were constructed by put the mixed sodium salt between two SUS or sodium metal electrodes. Ionic conductivity of mixed sodium salts was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with SUS electrodes symmetric cells. Na+ transference number was measured by potentiostatic polarization and EIS with sodium metal symmetric cells at 90℃.\n The binary phase diagram of NaFSA and NaFTA were shown in Fig.1. In the NaFTA-rich composition range (0.1 < x < 0.4), the phase diagram resembles a simple eutectic phase diagram, while, in the NaFTA-rich composition range (0.5 < x < 0.9), the mixed sodium salts exhibited pseudo-single-phase behavior, and the lowest liquid-phase transition temperature (T\n L) was observed at 90℃ of Na[(FSA)0.8(FTA)0.2].(1) Additionally, in this composition range, glass transition points (T\n g) were also confirmed, indicating the supercooled behavior.\n The Arrhenius plot of the ionic conductivity (σ) for Na[(FSA)0.8(FTA)0.2] was shown in Fig.2. At the T\n L around 90℃, σ was observed to 0.69 mS cm-1. This is attributed to the strong interactions between Na+ and anion in the absence of solvents, causing high viscosity and decreasing mobility. Below the T\n L, there was no remarkable decrease in σ and Nyquist plots remained non-divergent to 55℃, allowing for the attribution of σ. Moreover, below the T\n L, the glass transition and crystallization of Na[(FSA)0.8(FTA)0.2] were not observed. The temperature dependence of σ was analyzed by the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman (VFT) equation.(2) In addition, the σ(T\n g) at the observed T\n g from DSC were calculated by VFT equation. Also, the decoupling index (R\n τ), representing the ratio of ionic conductive relaxation time (τ\n σ) to structural relaxation time (τ\n s), were calculated.(3) The value of logR\n τ value for Na[(FSA)0.8(FTA)0.2] was -0.62 and the low value indicates that τ\n s is coupled with τ\n σ.\n To investigate the Na+ conduction behavior in Na[(FSA)0.8(FTA)0.2], chronoamperograms with an applied potential of 500 mV to the sodium metal symmetric cells were shown in Fig.3(a). Fig.3(b) shows Nyquist plots before and after direct current polarization. The steady current was observed after 8h. Furthermore, there was slightly changes of Nyquist plots before and after direct current (DC) polarization, stable interface between sodium metal and Na[(FSA)0.8(FTA)0.2] was also confirmed. The Na+ transference Number (t\n Na+) in the Na[(FSA)0.8(FTA)0.2] was estimated to be 0.86. Tatara et al. reported the t\n Na+ of 0.18 in the 1M NaPF6/PC+0.5vol% FEC.(4) Since molten salts consisting of only cations and anions should not be occurred concentration polarization, it exhibited a considerably higher t\n Na+ in Na[(FSA)0.8(FTA)0.2] compared to the t\n Na+ in dilute non-aqueous sodium electrolyte. In the presentation, we will discuss the cycle characteristics obtained by constant current charge-discharge tests of both half-cell and full-cell configurations using generic positive and negative electrode materials.\n (1) K.

However, application of RT-Na/S batteries is currently impeded by severe shuttle effects and volume expansion that limits both energy density and cycling stability. Herein, first, the first-principal calculation is used to find that the introduction of sulfur vacancies in MoS2 can effectively enhance polysulfide adsorption and catalytic ability as well as both the ion and electron conductivities. Then, unique MoS2- x /C composite spheres are further designed and synthesized with flower-like few-layer and interlayer-enlarged MoS2- x nanosheets space-confined in hollow carbon nanospheres by a \"ship-in-a-bottle\" strategy. With this novel design, the mass loading of S in the MoS2- x /C composite can be reached to as high as 75 wt%. Owing to the synergetic effect of interlayer-expanded and few-layer MoS2- x nanosheets and hollow carbon spheres matrix with high electronic/Na+ conductivity, the RT-Na/S batteries deliver highly stable cycle durability (capacity retention of 85.2% after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 ) and remarkable rate capability (415.7 mAh g-1 at 2 A g-1 ) along with high energy density.

Among them, reduced graphene oxide has shown great potential for more efficient storage of Na ions and is a current target in the design of electrodes for environmentally friendly Na ion batteries.

Here, the electrochemical responses of porous 3D-printed free-standing log-type structures fabricated using direct ink writing (DIW) with a graphene oxide (GO) gel ink are investigated after thermal reduction in a three-electrode cell configuration. The structures delivered capacities in the range of 50–80 mAh g−1 and showed high stability for more than 100 cycles. The reaction with the electrolyte/solvent system, which caused an initial capacity drop, was evidenced by the nucleation of various Na carbonates and Na2O. The incorporation of Na into the filaments of the structure was verified with transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy.

        "title": "Electrode Imbibition and Surfactant Interactions with Vanadium Flow Battery Electrolytes",
        "abstract": "Redox flow batteries (RFB) are a critical technology for stationary grid-scale energy storage, with potential usage with intermittent power sources, such as wind and solar. RFBs are attractive for long-duration energy storage because the anolyte and catholyte are stored separately external to the electrochemical reactor. Separating the electrolytes and the electrochemical cell decouples energy and power densities, unlike batteries that store charge in the solid-state, such as Li-ion, Pb-acid, or Ni-Cd. A standard RFB chemistry is the all-vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB), which utilizes the four oxidation states of vanadium, with V2+, V3+, V4+, and V5+. Recently our group found that adding small amounts of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to a VFRB increased the kinetics of the V2+ to V3+oxidation.\n Furthermore, surfactants play essential roles in battery manufacturing and operation. Surfactants can change metal oxide crystal structure, inhibit dendrite growth, limit corrosion, and prevent nanoparticle agglomeration. Surfactants are never wholly removed during manufacturing and can be present during battery operation. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how surfactants impact battery performance and their effect on the materials.\n This talk describes SDS's equilibrium surface properties and adsorption characteristics at the liquid−air and liquid-solid interfaces, thus providing insights into the interactions of SDS with a VFRB electrolyte. Experiments focusing on the effects of sulfuric acid and vanadium ions on SDS's equilibrium surface tension and critical micelle concentration (CMC) were completed. The Szyszkowski equation is used to calculate SDS's adsorption parameters, such as interfacial surface excess, Γsz [mol/m2], the surface excess at the saturated interface, Γ∞ [mol/m2], the minimum molecular area in the adsorption layer at the saturated interface, Amin [nm2], and the Gibbs free energy of adsorption, ΔGads [kJ/mol]. Furthermore, an examination of the spontaneous imbibition of the VFRB electrolyte with SDS into a porous carbon electrode is presented. The microstructure of porous systems, interfacial tension, and fluid−solid interactions controls the capillary-driven flow and is vital in multiphase flow in porous media. Therefore, understanding SDS's effects on the VFRB electrolyte in an electrode is critical to understanding the electrochemical reactions and molecular interactions occurring.\n This work was supported as part of the Breakthrough Electrolytes for Energy Storage and Systems (BEES2), an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences under Award # DE-SC0019409.",

Powder X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the phase is pure in the absence of long-range ordering of Co and Mn ions in the slab or Na(+) and vacancy in the interslab space. The oxidation states of the transition metal ions were studied by magnetic susceptibility measurements, electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR) and (23)Na magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectroscopy. The charge compensation is achieved by the stabilization of low-spin Co(3+) and Mn(4+) ions. The capability of Na(2/3)Co(2/3)Mn(1/3)O(2) to intercalate and deintercalate Na(+) reversibly was tested in electrochemical sodium cells. It appears that the P2 structure is maintained during cycling, the cell parameter evolution versus the sodium amount is given.

        "abstract": "Constructing potential electrode materials with a wide temperature property for high energy density second batteries has attracted huge interests in recent years. Herein, a hybrid electrode, consisting of nitrogen-doped carbon/α-MnS/flake graphite composite (α-MnS@N-C/FG), was prepared via a post-sulfurization route. In the α-MnS@N-C/FG composite, α-MnS nanoparticles that wrapped by N-C layer are uniformly embedded onto FG, forming a novel nanofoam structure. As-obtained α-MnS@N-C/FG shows excellent lithium/sodium storage performance, with a specific capacity of 712 mAh g-1 in the 700th cycle at 1.0 A g-1 or 186.4 mAh g-1 in the 100th cycle at 100 mA g-1 using lithium or sodium foil as the counter electrode, respectively. Moreover, even operated at stern temperature of -20 oC, the α-MnS@N-C/FG can still attain high specific capacity of 350 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles at 100 mA g-1 for LIBs. This exceptional electrochemical response is endorsed to the synergetic effect of the smart design of a hybrid nanofoam structure, in which the FG skeleton and N-C coating layer can significantly enhance the conductivity of the whole electrode from bottom to up. Accordingly, the enhanced redox kinetics endow the electrode with pseudocapacitive-dominated electrochemical behaviors, thus bringing fast electrode reactions and robust structural stability to the whole electrode.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The interfacial reactions in sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are not well understood yet. The formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in SIBs is still challenging due to the higher solubility of the SEI components compared to lithium analogues. This study therefore aims to shed light on the dissolution of SEI influenced by the electrolyte chemistry. By conducting electrochemical tests with extended open circuit pauses, and using surface spectroscopy, we determine the extent of self‐discharge due to SEI dissolution. Instead of using a conventional separator, β‐alumina was used as sodium‐conductive membrane to avoid crosstalk between the working and sodium‐metal counter electrode. The relative capacity loss after a pause of 50 hours in the tested electrolyte systems ranges up to 30 %. The solubility of typical inorganic SEI species like NaF and Na2CO3 was determined. The electrolytes were then saturated by those SEI species in order to oppose ageing due to the dissolution of the SEI.",

        "abstract": "Carbon xerogels were synthesized using a soft-template route with resorcinol as the carbon source and sodium carbonate as the catalyst. The influence of the resorcinol to catalyst ratio in the range of 500–20,000 on pore structure, graphitic domains, and electronic conductivity of as-prepared carbon xerogels, as well as their performance in an aluminium ion battery (AIB), was investigated. After carbonization steps of the polymers up to 800 °C, all carbon samples exhibited similar specific volumes of micropores (0.7–0.8 cm³ g−1), while samples obtained from mixtures with R/C ratios lower than 2000 led to carbon xerogels with significantly higher mesopore diameters up to 6 nm. The best results, in terms of specific surface (1000 m² g−1), average pore size (6 nm) and reversible capacity in AIB cell (28 mAh g−1 @ 0.1 A g−1), were obtained with a carbon xerogel sample synthetized at a resorcinol to catalyst ratio of R/C = 500 (CXG500). Though cyclic voltammograms of carbon xerogel samples did not exhibit any sharp peaks in the applied potential window, the presence of both oxidation and a quite wide reduction peak in CXG500–2000 cyclic voltammograms indicated pseudocapacitance behaviour induced by diffusion-controlled intercalation/de-intercalation of AlCl4− ions into/from the carbon xerogel matrix. This was confirmed by shifting of the (002) peak towards lower 2θ angle values in the XRD pattern of the CXG500 electrode after the charging step in AIB, whereas the contribution of pseudocapacitance, calculated from half-cell measurements, was limited to only 6% of overall capacitance.",

        "abstract": "As a promising candidate for next-generation energy storage devices, Zn metal battery excels with their good safety, high speciﬁc capacity, and economic attractiveness. However, it still suﬀers from a narrow electrochemical window, notorious dendrite formation, and sluggish Zn ion transfer. Aqueous electrolyte engineering has been regarded as an eﬀective way to improve these. It is shown that by adding sodium polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) polymers into a dilute 1 m Zn(OTf) 2 aqueous electrolyte, compact water shells with stronger hydrogen bonding and more ordered structures are formed around the polymer chains. As a result, a fast transport channel to the zinc ions is provided. The PSS chains also protect the zinc electrode from directly contacting the water molecules and thus suppress water decomposition. With these merits, a Zn//Cu cell demonstrates a high coulombic eﬃciency of ≈ 99% after 1500 h cycling. Meanwhile, a record-high cumulative Zn plating capacity of 10 000 mA h cm − 2 is obtained using a Zn||Zn cell. In addition, the Zn//C@V 2 O 5 full cell achieves almost 100% capacity retention after 1000 cycles.

        "abstract": "Structural trends, physical properties, and electrochemical performances of the NaFexRu2-xO4 system have been investigated. Synthesis attempts using both conventional solid-state routes and high-pressure methods were explored for the compositional range 1.0 ≤ x ≤ 1.67. Based on Rietveld refinements against powder X-ray diffraction data, analyses of 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy data, and elemental analysis by electron microprobe, the existence of a confined compositional solid solution (1 ≤ x ≤ 1.3) adopting the CaFe2O4-type postspinel structure is demonstrated. This is contrasted with the NaFexTi2-xO4 system, for which no evidence of a solid solution is observed. However, for all explored synthetic routes of NaFexRu2-xO4 compositions, a trivalent iron oxidation state is maintained. Structural analysis and qualitative bond valence energy landscape models reveal that the progressive integration of iron into the postspinel framework results in narrowed sodium ion diffusion channels, restricting electrochemical deintercalation of sodium. Consequently, the CaFe2O4-type iron-rich compounds explored in this study demonstrate limited potential as positive electrode materials for sodium batteries. It is expected that this fundamental insight will help guide the exploration of alternative NaM2O4-based positive electrode materials with similar structure types.",

The MoS2/SWNT composite films are highly porous, electrically conductive, and mechanically robust due to its percolating carbon nanotube network. When directly employed as the working electrode, they exhibit a specific capacity of >400 mAh/g and volumetric capacity of ∼650 mAh/cm(3). Their mechanical stability allows them to be processed into free-standing films with tunable thickness up to ∼100 μm, corresponding to an areal loading of 15 mg/cm(2). Their high electrical conductivity allows the high volumetric capacity to be retained, even at high thickness, resulting in state-of-the-art areal capacities of >4.0 mAh/cm(2).

However, their poor electrical conductivity usually leads to unsatisfied performance and poor cycling stability.

We demonstrated that the introduction of melamine played an essential role in the construction of V2O3/NC HSs. Benefitting from the special mesoporous structure and large specific surface area, the as-obtained sample exhibited enhanced conductivity and structural stability. As a proof of concept, well-defined V2O3/NC HSs exhibited excellent cycling stability and rate performance for sodium-ion batteries, and achieved a discharge capacity of 263.8 mA h g-1 at a current density of 1.0 A g-1 after 1000 cycles, one of the best performances of V-based compounds. The enhanced performance could be attributed to the synergistic effect of the hollow structure and surface carbon coating.

        "title": "Systematic Investigations of Surface Oxygen Functional Groups on Spherical Hard Carbon for Sodium-Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "The surface activity of hard carbons and its effect on the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) in sodium ion batteries has gained significant interest in the scientific community over the last years. The surface of hard carbons thus plays a pivotal role within the cell, as it constitutes the interface between the bulk material and the electrolyte. Following pyrolysis of the carbon-rich precursor at high temperatures, various oxygen functional groups (OFGs) and defects, such as five- or seven-membered rings, are present on the surface of the resulting hard carbons. The influence of OFGs on the surface is however controversially discussed. On the one hand, irreversible reactions of sodium ions with OFGs lower the initial coulombic efficiency (ICE), which leads to a decreased energy density. On the other hand, OFGs may also serve as nucleation sites for the SEI leading to a more conductive interfacial phase for sodium ions. Although many approaches of additional oxygen functionalization on the surface of hard carbons have already been reported, they mostly employ harsh reaction conditions disregarding the morphological impact on the carbon surface.\n In our studies, oxo-functionalized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are adsorbed on the surface to serve as model OFGs on surface oxygen deficient hard carbons. The versatility of functionalized pyrenes in combination with nondestructive adsorption enables independent investigations on the oxygen functionalization of the hard carbon surface. In the first step, native surface oxygen groups are cleaved from the pristine hard carbon through a high-temperature post-treatment in hydrogen atmosphere. Afterwards, selective re-introduction of surface OFGs is achieved through adsorption of oxo-functionalized pyrene derivatives such as 1-hydroxypyrene or 1-pyrenecarboxylic acid to simulate hydroxy or carboxylic surface functionalities. Additionally, various spatially configurations of surface OFGs can be mimicked by elongating the distance between the oxygen functionality and the pyrene backbone through a short alkyl chain (e.g. 1-pyrenebutyric acid).\n Our systematic approach of selectively re-introducing surface OFGs allows the discrimination between different surface OFGs and their influence on the SEI. The surface of our modified hard carbons is characterized by X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy to evaluate the oxygen content and determine the defect concentration. The electrochemical performance is assessed by rate performance tests and cyclic voltammetry in three-electrode half-cells with sodium metal as counter and reference electrode. Initial findings validate the correlation between surface oxygen functionalization determined by XPS and the electrochemical formation potential of the SEI during the first cycle. After high-temperature treatment in a hydrogen atmosphere, the surface oxygen content decreases from ~5% to 2%, leading to a significant lowering of the plateau capacity. Simultaneously, the ICE decreases from 79% to 55%. Cyclic voltammetry of deoxygenated hard carbon reveals that the SEI formation potential is shifted from ~1.0 V vs. Na towards lower potentials of ~0.3 V vs. Na indicating that different decomposition products are formed. Furthermore, rate performance is substantially deteriorated by the development of a modified SEI. Ex-situ XPS of cycled electrodes and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are used to identify differences in the SEI composition and link them to the electrochemical performance of our spherical hard carbons.\n Figure: 1-Pyrenebutyric acid adsorbed on the surface of hard carbon highlighting the different possible spatially orientations of the oxygen functional group.\n \n \n \n \n Figure 1\n",

        "abstract": "Due to their high energy density, lithium/sodium metal batteries (LMBs/SMBs) are expected to be the next generation of energy storage systems. However, the further application of alkali metal batteries based on liquid electrolytes is limited due to increasing safety concerns. Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs), which combine the advantages of the high ionic conductivity of liquid electrolytes and excellent mechanical properties of solid polymer electrolytes, are considered to play an irreplaceable role in the realization of high-performance alkali metal batteries. In this work, a flexible boron-containing GPE (B-GPE) with a cross-linked polymer network structure is prepared by a UV-induced process. The as-prepared B-GPE exhibits good ionic conductivity and has an extremely high ion transference number due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the boron moiety and the facile electrolyte uptake ability of the ethylene oxide chain. Furthermore, a \"gentle\" electrode/electrolyte contact is designed by a one-step in situ polymerization method, which can enhance ion transport within the electrode and at the electrode/electrolyte interface due to the presence of a continuous polymer phase for ion conduction. Therefore, LMBs and SMBs containing B-GPE are able to effectively inhibit the growth of dendrites while exhibiting excellent cycling stability. These comprehensive results indicate that this novel B-GPE possesses potential applications for high-performance alkali metal batteries.",

        "abstract": "Phase transition engineering, with the ability to alter the electronic structure and physicochemical properties of materials, has been widely used to achieve the thermodynamically unstable metallic phase MoS2 (1T-MoS2), although the complex operating conditions and low yield of previous strategies make the large-scale fabrication of 1T-MoS2 a big challenge. Herein, we report a facile electron injection strategy for phase transition engineering and fabricate a composite of conductive TiO chemically bonded to 1T-MoS2 nanoflowers (TiO-1T-MoS2 NFs) on a large scale. The underlying mechanism analysis reveals that electron-injection-engineering triggers a reorganization of the Mo 4d orbitals and results in a 100% phase transition of MoS2 from 2H to 1T. In the TiO-1T-MoS2 NFs composite, the 1T-MoS2 demonstrates a higher electronic conductivity, a lower Na+ diffusion barrier, and a more restricted S release than 2H-MoS2. In addition, conductive TiO bonding successfully resolves the stability challenge of the 1T phase. These merits endow TiO-1T-MoS2 NFs electrodes with an excellent rate capability (650/288 mAh g-1 at 50/20 000 mA g-1, respectively) and an outstanding cyclability (501 mAh g-1 at 1000 mA g-1 after 700 cycles) in sodium ion batteries. Such an improvement signifies that this facile and scalable phase-transition engineering combined with a deep mechanism analysis offers an important reference for designing advanced materials for various applications.",

        "abstract": "Redox-active covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a new class of material with the potential to transform electrochemical energy storage due to the well-defined porosity and readily accessible redox-active sites of COFs. However, combining both high specific capacity and energy density in COF-based batteries remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we demonstrate the exceptional performance of Aza-COF in rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Aza-COF is a microporous 2D COF synthesized from hexaketocyclohexane and 1,2,4,5-benzenetetramine by a condensation reaction, which affords phenazine-decorated channels and a theoretical specific capacity of 603 mA h g-1. The Aza-COF-based electrode exhibits an exceptional average specific capacity (550 mA h g-1), energy density (492 W h kg-1) at 0.1 C, and power density (1182 W kg-1) at 40 C. The high capacity and energy density are attributed to swift surface-controlled redox processes and rapid sodium-ion diffusion inside the porous electrode. Rate capability studies showed that the battery also performs well at high current rates: 1 C (363 mA h g-1), 5 C (232 mA h g-1), 10 C (161 mA h g-1), and 20 C (103 mA h g-1). In addition, the long-term cycling stability test revealed very good capacity retention (87% at 5 C) and Coulombic efficiencies near unity over 500 cycles.",

Na2Mn(SO4)2·4H2O is a new member of the blödite family of compounds, whereas Na2Ni(SO4)2·10H2O is isostructural with Na2Mg(SO4)2·10H2O. The structure of Na2Mn(SO4)2·4H2O is built up of [Mn(SO4)2(H2O)4]2− building blocks connected through moderate O–H⋯O hydrogen bonds with the sodium atoms occupying the large tunnels along the a axis and the manganese atom lying on an inversion center, whereas the structure of Na2Ni(SO4)2·10H2O is built up of [Ni(H2O)6]2+ and [Na2(SO4)2(H2O)4]2− layers. These layers which are parallel to the (100) plane are interconnected through moderate O–H⋯O hydrogen bonds. The thermal gravimetric- and the powder X-ray diffraction-analyzes showed that only the nickel phase was almost pure. At a temperature above 300 °C, all the water molecules evaporated and a structural phase transition from P21/c-Na2Ni(SO4)2·10H2O to C2/c-Na2Ni(SO4)2 was observed. C2/c-Na2Ni(SO4)2 is thermally more stable than Na2Fe(SO4)2 and therefore it would be suitable as the positive electrode for sodium ion batteries if a stable electrolyte at high voltage is developed.",

        "abstract": "For alkali-metal ion batteries, revealing the phase transformation and the ion migration dynamics in the electrodes is vital for understanding how the electrodes work and thereby how we can improve them. Here, using in situ transmission electron microscopy, we track the structural evolution and migration dynamics during sodium insertion into TiS2 nanostructures with the lattice fringe resolution. We find that the sodiation process of TiS2 is initiated by an intercalation reaction and followed by a conversion reaction. From the same reaction event, the velocity of intercalation/conversion phase boundary migration is found to be ∼1.0-1.7 nm s-1, while the pristine/intercalation phase boundary migrates at a velocity of ∼2.5 nm s-1. The sodium migration leads to structural fracture to form nanometer-sized domains (∼3 nm) with volume expansion. During migration, Na prefers to transport along specific directions. Furthermore, a superstructured Na0.25TiS2 intermediate phase with ordered Na ions occupied within the (0001) plane is formed at the reaction front, which is different from the common staging phase. These findings help us understand the working principle and the failure mechanism of the sodium ion battery and also provide useful insights into the general ionic doping of transition metal dichalcogenides.",

Here, a covalent organic polymer (COP) based material (denoted as CityU‐9) is designed and synthesized by integrating multiple redox motifs (benzoquinone and thioether), improved conductivity (sulfur induction), and intrinsic insolubility (rigid skeleton).

MoS2 is a promising anode material for SIBs due to its high theoretical sodium storage capability and large interspace for accommodating sodium ions with a larger ionic radius than lithium ions. However, bulk MoS2 exhibits a sluggish kinetics for the intercalation-deintercalation of sodium ions and large volume expansion, which result in poor cyclability and rate performance. In this study, we designed few-layered MoS2/C nanoflowers with expanded interspacing of MoS2-MoS2 planes using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as an intercalating reagent and a carbon precursor. Due to the unique nanostructure and larger interlayer spacing, the MoS2/C nanoflower electrode achieves a high reversible specific capacity of 400 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles at 500 mA g-1 for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), showing a good cycling stability.

The addition of ionic liquid in the carbonate‐based electrolyte solution results in (i) enhancing ionic conductivity to be comparable with a solvent‐free IL‐based electrolyte, (ii) maintaining the electrochemical stability window, and (iii) IL acted as a retardant rather than a flame‐inhibitor based on the self‐extinguish time (SET) of the mixed electrolyte mixture when exposed to a free flame. All mixed electrolyte systems have been tested in sodium‐coin cells versus Na0.44MnO2 (NMO) and hard carbon (HC) electrodes. The cells show good performances in charge/discharge cycling with a retention > 96 % after 30 cycles (∼90 mAh.g‐1 for NMO and 180 mAh.g‐1 for HC, respectively) demonstrating good interfacial stability and highly stable discharge capacities.",

        "abstract": "Metal-polydopamine coordination chemistry attracts great attention owing to the synergistic effect of adjustable components and advantageous structures. However, few efforts have been devoted to exploring bimetal-polydopamine composites, especially for multistructural composites with high-capacity components and high stability. In this regard, the TiO2 @C-WSe2 core-shell nanospheres are designed and fabricated based on Ti-W-polydopamine composites after selenization, in which the TiO2 nanoparticles are encapsulated or embedded in the carbon nanospheres and the external WSe2 nanosheets are grown epitaxially on the carbon surfaces, featuring multiple channels for ion diffusion and abundant active edges for electrochemical reactions. The introduction of WSe2 not only greatly improves the capacity but also results in exponential growth of the active edge. As a result, the as-prepared TiO2 @C-WSe2 displayed long-term cycling performance in lithium-ion batteries. Furthermore, the anode is assembled into sodium-ion batteries, manifesting a stable capacity of 352 mA h g-1 at 1.0 A g-1 even after 2000 cycles, one of the best performances for polydopamine-based composites. Enhanced performance can be attributed to the synergies of high-capacity components and different dimensional materials. This work highlights that the rational design of functional structures provides a novel inspiration for electrodes with effective nanoarchitectures.",

        "abstract": "\n Additive manufacturing represents a unique approach to develop three-dimensional shape-conformable batteries with enhanced surface area, ion diffusion, and power. For the first time, a composite photocurable resin loaded with solid particles of active materials and conductive additives was prepared and used as feedstock to print negative electrodes for sodium-ion and lithium-ion batteries by means of a vat photopolymerization 3D printer. In alignment with NASA’s Artemis mission goals to develop sustainable lunar energy storage infrastructure to support long-term human operations, TiO2 was selected as an active material for the negative electrode due to its abundance on the lunar surface. The TiO2 loading in the composite photocurable resin was increased as much as possible to maximize the electrochemical performance of the printed electrodes, while simultaneously ensuring printability and good mechanical strength for sample handling. The effect of thermal post-processing on the electrical, electrochemical, and mechanical performance is reported. A configurational study is implemented to identify the impact of electrode designs (cubic and gyroid) on the electrochemical performance. This work addresses the difficulties related to the introduction of solid particles within a photocurable resin and the need for a compromise between the electrochemical performances and printability to obtain fully functional VPP-printed electrodes.",

Understanding the miscibility of Na into Pb is crucial for the development of high-energy density negative electrode materials for NIBs. Using a first-principles multiscale approach, we analyze the thermodynamic properties and estimate the Na-alloying voltage of the Na-Pb system by constructing the compositional phase diagram. In the Pb-Na system, we elucidate the phase boundaries of important phases, such as Pb-rich face-centered cubic and $\\beta$-NaPb$_3$, thereby improving our understanding of the phase diagram of the Na-Pb alloy.

        "abstract": "Low-valence titanium sulfides (LVTS) have metal-like electrical conductivities and a strong polysulfide binding abilities, which are promising anodes for sodium ion batteries with high capacities and long cycle lifes. However, it is difficult for traditional synthesis methods to synthesize LVTS without impurities. The electric field regulation method possesses the advantages of flexibility and high efficiency, achieving accurate control of the metal reduction process by adjusting the electrolysis potential and reaction time. In this work, we synthesized a series of LVTS (TiS and Ti2S) using electric field control methods and investigated their electrochemical behaviors as sodium storage anodes for the first time. Compared with traditional TiS2, LVTS display remarkable Na storage properties under the condition of complete electrochemical conversion at 0.005-3 V. Especially for TiS, it demonstrates a high capacity of 409 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 and inspiring cyclic stability over 6000 cycles. The large number of vacancies in the crystal structure can chemically anchor polysulfides and alleviate their dissolution in the electrolyte, resulting in superior long-term cyclic stability. The high intrinsic conductivity of LVTS is in favor of rapid transfer of electrons and promotes the fast conversion of polysulfides to sodium sulfides, thus realizing high reversible capacities. Moreover, with its fast Na+ transport kinetics, the as-prepared TiS demonstrates an impressive rate performance of 321 mAh g-1 at 15 A g-1. Overall, the electric field regulation method is flexible and efficient, which provides a new route for the preparation of high-performance electrode materials. Moreover, nonstoichiometric metal compounds possess abundant active sites and rapid electron transport kinetics, which provide a new choice for promising sodium storage materials in large-scale energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "Silicon is a promising anode material for next generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) because of its surprisingly high theoretical capacity, but it suffers from severe volume changes during charge and discharge process which results in substantial deterioration of the electrode. A novel fluorinated copolymer with three different polar groups was synthesized to overcome this problem: carboxylic acid, amid and fluorinated groups on a single polymer backbone. Moreover, a dual crosslinked network binder was prepared by thermal polymerization of the fluorinated copolymer and sodium alginate. Unlike the common chemical crosslinked network with a gradual and nonreversible fracturing, the dual crosslinked network which combine chemical and physical crosslinking could effectively hold the silicon particles during the volume change process. As a result, excellent electrochemical performance (1557 mAh g-1 at a 4 A g-1 current destiny after 200 cycles) was achieved with this novel reversible crosslinked binder. Further researches in regard to the influences of fluorine and acrylamide content were conducted to systematically evaluate designed binder. Moreover, with the help of new binder, the silicon/graphite and silicon oxide/graphite electrode exhibit superb cycle performance with capacity fade rate of 0.1% and 0.025% per cycle over 200 and 700 cycles, respectively. Such a novel and facile design represents a resultful method manufacturing high-performance Si-based anodes and advancing the realization of practical application.",

        "abstract": "Flexible polypyrrole (PPy) films with highly ordered structures were fabricated by a novel vapor phase polymerization (VPP) process and used as the anode material in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The PPy films demonstrate excellent rate performance and cycling stability. At a charge/discharge rate of 1 C, the reversible capacities of the PPy film anode reach 284.9 and 177.4 mAh g-1 in LIBs and SIBs, respectively. Even at a charge/discharge rate of 20 C, the reversible capacity of the PPy film anode retains 54.0% and 52.9% of the capacity of 1 C in LIBs and SIBs, respectively. After 1000 electrochemical cycles at a rate of 10 C, there is no obvious capacity fading. The molecular structure and electrochemical behaviors of Li- and Na-ion doping and dedoping in the PPy films are investigated by XPS and ex situ XRD. It is believed that the PPy film electrodes in the overoxidized state can be reversibly charged and discharged through the doping and dedoping of lithium or sodium ions. Because of the self-adaptation of the doped ions, the ordered pyrrolic chain structure can realize a fast charge/discharge process.

Furthermore, it is also disclosed that such superior electrochemical properties can be attributed to the pseudocapacitive behavior of FeS shell as demonstrated by the kinetics studies as well as the core-shell structure.

This work proposes a novel electrochemical system that can harvest energy originating from entropic changes due to alteration in the concentration of sodium ions along wastewater treatment. Preparation of a self-assembled material from nickel Prussian blue analogue (NPBA) was the first step to obtain such electrochemical system. Investigation into the electrochemical properties of this material helped to evaluate its potential use in neutralization and mixing entropy batteries. Assessment of parameters such as the potentiodynamic profile of the current density as a function of the concentration of protons and sodium ions, charge capacity, and cyclability as well as the reversibility of the sodium ion electroinsertion process aided estimation of the energy storage efficiency of the system. Frequency-domain measurements and models and the proposed charge compensation mechanism provided the rate constants at different dc potentials. After each charge/discharge cycle, the NPBA electrode harvested 12.4 kJ per mol of intercalated sodium ion in aqueous solutions of NaCl at concentrations of 20 mM and 3.0 M. The full electrochemical cell consisted of an NPBA positive electrode and a negative electrode of silver particles dispersed in a polypyrrole electrode. This cell extracted 16.8 kJ per mol of intercalated ion after each charge/discharge cycle. On the basis of these results, the developed electrochemical system should encourage wastewater treatment and help to achieve sustainable growth.",

Here, we grow sodiophilic thin film materials with tin and nickel-tin components uniformly on three-dimensional nickel foam (3D-Ni) to obtain a 3D sodiophilic composite framework (namely 3D-NiSn) using a reproducible and mass-produced electrodeposition strategy. The combination of sodiophilic film (NiSn) and 3D porous framework could lower nucleation overpotential of Na and accelerate ions diffusion, hence inducing the uniform deposition and reversible stripping of sodium and inhibiting the growth of Na dendrites, which makes the 3D-NiSn/Na composite anode exhibit good performance compared to 3D-Ni/Na and Na-foil. The symmetrical cells with 3D-NiSn/Na can maintain up to 2500 h at 2 mA cm−2 and 1 mAh cm−2 with a low overpotential of around 30 mV during the whole cycling process.

        "abstract": "The development of stable and efficient electrode materials is imperative and also indispensable for further commercialization of sodium/potassium-ion batteries (SIBs/PIBs) and new detrimental issues such as proton intercalation arise when utilizing aqueous electrolytes. Herein the electrochemical performance of the Cu4Se4 nanosheet was determined for both organic and aqueous SIBs and PIBs. By means of density functional theory calculation, Na+, K+ and H+ intercalations onto both sides of the Cu4Se4 nanosheet were revealed. The Cu4Se4 nanosheet well maintains its metallic electronic conductivity and the changes in lateral lattice parameters are within 4.66% during the whole Na+/K+ intercalation process for both SIBS and PIBs. The theoretical maximum Na/K storage capacity of 188.07 mA h g-1 can be achieved by stabilized second-layer adsorption of Na+/K+. The migration barriers of Na and K atoms on the Cu4Se4 nanosheet are 0.270 and 0.173 eV, respectively. It was discovered that Na/K- intercalation in the first layer is accompanied by a first-order surface phase transition, resulting in an intercalation voltage plateau of 0.659/0.756 V, respectively. The region of the two-surface phase coexistence for PIBs, is shifted toward a lower coverage when compared with that for SIBs. The partially protonated Cu4Se4 nanosheet (HxCu4Se4, x ≤ 10/9) was revealed to be structurally and thermodynamically stable. While the partially protonated Cu4Se4 nanosheet is favorable in acidic electrolytes (pH = 0) when protons and Na/K ions compete, we showed that Na+/K+ intercalated products may be preferred over H+ at low coverages in alkali electrolyte (pH = 14). However, the proton intercalation substantially decreases the battery capacity in aqueous SIBs and PIBs. Our work not only identifies the promising performance of Cu4Se4 nanosheets as an electrode material of SIBs and PIBs, but also provides a computational method for aqueous metal-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "A microscale battery comprised of mechanically exfoliated molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) flakes with copper connections and a sodium metal reference was created and investigated as an intercalation model using in situ atomic force microscopy in a dry room environment. While an ethylene carbonate-based electrolyte with a low vapor pressure allowed topographical observations in an open cell configuration, the planar microbattery was used to conduct in situ measurements to understand the structural changes and the concomitant solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation at the nanoscale. Topographical observations demonstrated permanent wrinkling behavior of MoS2 electrodes upon sodiation at 0.4 V. SEI formation occurred quickly on both flake edges and planes at voltages before sodium intercalation. Force spectroscopy measurements provided quantitative data on the SEI thickness for MoS2 electrodes in sodium-ion batteries for the first time.",

        "abstract": "A carbon-coated Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 polyanion material was prepared by the sol-gel method and then studied as the negative electrode materials for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries. The material showed a specific capacity of 268.6 mAh g-1 in the voltage window of 0.01-3.0 V vs Na+/Na0. Due to the fast diffusion of Na+ in the NASICON framework, the material exhibited superior rate capability with a specific capacity of 94.4 mAh g-1 at a current density of 5A g-1. Additionally, 99.1% capacity retention was achieved after 300 cycles, demonstrating excellent cycle stability. By comparison, Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 delivered 629.2 mAh g-1 in 0.01-3.0 V vs Li+/Li0, much higher than that of the sodium-ion cells. During the first discharge, the material decomposed to Ti/Mg nanoparticles, which were encapsulated in an amorphous SEI and Li3PO4 matrix. Li+ ions were stored in the Li3PO4 matrix and the SEI film formed/decomposed in subsequent cycles, contributing to the large Li+ capacity of Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3. However, the lithium-ion cells exhibited inferior rate capability and cycle stability compared to the sodium-ion cells due to the sluggish electrochemical kinetics of the electrode.",

        "abstract": "The ordering effects in anthraquinone (AQ) stacking forced by thin-film application and its influence on dimer solubility and current collector adhesion are investigated. The structural characteristics of AQ and its chemical environment are found to have a substantial influence on its electrochemical performance. Computational investigation for different charged states of AQ on a carbon substrate obtained via basin hopping global minimization provides important insights into the physicochemical thin-film properties. The results reveal the ideal stacking configurations of the individual AQ-carrier systems and show ordering effects in a periodic supercell environment. The latter reveals the transition from intermolecular hydrogen bonding toward the formation of salt bridges between the reduced AQ units and a stabilizing effect upon the dimerlike rearrangement, while the strong surface–molecular interactions in the thin-film geometries are found to be crucial for the formed dimers to remain electronically active. Both characteristics, the improved current collector adhesion and the stabilization due to dimerization, are mutual benefits of thin-film electrodes over powder-based systems. This hypothesis has been further investigated for its potential application in sodium ion batteries. Our results show that AQ thin-film electrodes exhibit significantly better specific capacities (233 vs 87 mAh g–1 in the first cycle), Coulombic efficiencies, and long-term cycling performance (80 vs 4 mAh g–1 after 100 cycles) over the AQ powder electrodes. By augmenting the experimental findings via computational investigations, we are able to suggest design strategies that may foster the performance of industrially desirable powder-based electrode materials.",

Citrate-aided coprecipitation decelerates the crystallization, assembling cubic-shaped powder based on separation between nucleation and growth. This study revealed that coprecipitation temperature determines the electrochemical performance. With lower temperatures, the smaller particles with more water are formed by predominant nucleation, resulting in low crystallinity and capacity of 58 mAh g -1 . Expanded surface area reduces electrode/electrolyte interface's charge transfer resistanc e and excellent rate capability (79% of initial capacity at 100 C-rate). However, poor cyclability was obtained. At elevated temperatures, the nuclei's growth and dehydration occur, and thus highly crystalline large particles are formed. In turn, NiHCF delivers excellent capacity of 76 mAh g -1 at 1 C-rate but exhibits inferior rate performance because of longer diffusional path. Meanwhile, normal coprecipitation at 70 o C induces irregular-shaped tiny particles, presenting 93% retention of initial capacity at 100 C-rate.",

In contrast, conversion-based transition metal sulfides have high theoretical capacities and are suitable anode materials for SIBs. Iron sulfide (FeS) is environmentally benign and inexpensive but suffers from low conductivity and sluggish Na-ion diffusion kinetics. In addition, significant volume changes during the sodiation of FeS destroy the electrode structure and shorten the cycle life. Herein, we report the rational design of the FeS/carbon composite, specifically FeS encapsulated within a hierarchically ordered mesoporous carbon prepared via nanocasting using a SBA-15 template with stable cycle life. We evaluated the Na-ion storage properties and found that the parallel 2D mesoporous channels in the resultant FeS/carbon composite enhanced the conductivity, buffered the volume changes, and prevented unwanted side reactions. Further, high-rate Na-ion storage (363.4 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 2 A g−1, 132.5 mAh g−1 at 20 A g−1) was achieved, better than that of the bare FeS electrode, indicating the benefit of structural confinement for rapid ion transfer, and demonstrating the excellent electrochemical performance of this anode material at high rates.",

        "abstract": "Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are emerging as a powerful alternative to lithium-ion battery systems in large-scale energy storage owing to plentiful resources. Nevertheless, pursuing high-yield anode materials with high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and superior rate capability is still one of the most critical challenges in practical application. Herein, an integrated electrode (PC-x) derived from a petroleum coke precursor (carbon residue rate as high as 89%) is regulated from microstructural engineering to binder optimization devoting to high ICE and efficient potassium storage. Excitingly, with a strong assist from a sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binder, the PC-900 anode displays an ultrahigh ICE of 80.5%, one of the highest values reported for PIB carbon anodes. Simultaneously, the PC-900 anode submits a high capacity (304.3 mAh g-1), superb rate (138.2 mAh g-1 at 10C), and excellent stability. Furthermore, the full cell exhibits an outstanding rate and cycling performance (210.7 mAh g-1 at 0.5C), confirming its large-scale application prospects. The ultrahigh ICE and excellent performance are mainly attributable to the beneficial microstructures (low surface area, functional group content, and larger interlayer spacing) created by microstructural engineering. Meanwhile, binder optimization also plays a crucial role in reducing the irreversible capacity and interface impedance, further improving the ICE and rate capability. Importantly, mechanism analysis confirms two-stage K+ storage behavior: reversible adsorption at edges and defects (>0.25 V) and intercalation into crystalline layers (<0.25 V). This work provides an efficient and easily scalable electrode design strategy for future practical applications of PIBs.",

        "abstract": "Non-graphitizable carbon allows reversible sodium-ion intercalation and hence enables stable and high-capacity sodium storage, making it a promising material for achieving long-term cycling stability in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). This study investigated the interfacial reactions between various electrolytes and a non-graphitizable carbon electrode for their use in SIBs. The morphology and particle diameter of the non-graphitizable carbon, HC-2000, remained unchanged after heat treatment, indicating its stability. The X-ray diffraction pattern and Raman spectrum suggested a disordered structure of HC-2000 carbon. The interlayer spacing, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller specific surface area, and density were determined to be 0.37 nm, 5.8 m2 g−1, and 1.36 g cm−3, respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis showed that the charge transfer resistances differed between the Na salts and other electrolytes. Therefore, the use of a large amount of NaF in the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) resulted in high charge transfer resistances at the non-graphitizable electrodes. However, there were no apparent differences in the activation energy or reversible capacity. In summary, NaF obstructs the penetration pathway of sodium ions into non-graphitizable carbon, impacting the charge transfer resistance and rate stability of SIBs. Charge–discharge measurements revealed reversible capacities of 260–290 mAh g−1, and the rate performance varied depending on the electrolyte. Therefore, an SEI containing minimal inorganic species, such as NaF, is desirable for efficient sodium-ion insertion into non-graphitizable carbon.",

The electrode employing the mesoporous Cu2 Se exhibits superior and more stable specific capacity as a NIB anode compared to the non-porous samples. The electrode also exhibits excellent rate tolerance at each current density, from 100 to 1000 mA g-1 . It is suggested that the mesoporous structure is advantageous for the insertion of Na ions inside the flakes. Electrochemical analysis indicates that the mesoporous electrode possesses more prominent diffusion-controlled kinetics during the sodiation-desodiation process, which contributes to the improvement of Na-ion storage performance.",

        "abstract": "Organic-metal coordination materials with rich structural diversity are considered as promising electrode materials for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries. However, the electrochemical performance can be constrained by the limited number of active sites and structural instability under the discharge/charge process. Herein, organometallic polymer microspheres (Fe-PDA-220) with a unique d-π conjugated structure was designed and successfully constructed through a simple synchronous polymerization and coordination reactions. Polymerization of phenylenediamine was initiated by Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions generated synchronously during the polymerization integrated with poly-aminoquinone chains to form Fe-C12N8 active centers. Used as electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries, the distinctive Fe-C bond significantly boosts the structural stability, and the π-d conjugation system could facilitate electron transfer. A high reversible capacity of 345 mAh g-1 was delivered at 0.1 A g-1 and a capacity of 106 mAh g-1 was maintained even after discharged/charged at 1.0 A g-1 for 5000 cycles, outperforming most reported coordination materials. Spectroscopic and electronic analyses revealed that a two-electron reaction occurred per active unit, accompanied by the reversible redox evolution of the C=N groups and Fe ions during  sodiation/desodiation. This work provides a promising and efficient strategy for boosting the electrochemical performance of organic electrode materials by the design of organometallic polymers.",

        "abstract": "Aqueous sodium-ion batteries represent a promising approach for stationary energy storage; however, the lack of appropriate anode materials has substantially retarded their development. Herein, we demonstrated an iron-based phosphate material of Na3Fe3(PO4)4 as an inexpensive and efficacious anode alternative. While the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple renders a two-Na-insertion reaction with desirable potentials, its unique layered structure further facilitates the Na-insertion kinetics and reversibility. Consequently, this electrode exhibits an appealing Na-insertion performance, with a reversible capacity of ∼83 mAh g–1, suitable anode potential of −0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl, excellent rate capability of 200 C, and outstanding cycling of 6000 cycles. Utilizing operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we revealed the structural evolution of the Na3Fe3(PO4)4 anode during the two-electron reaction, where the extremely small volume expansion (∼3%) enables its fast-charging and long-cycling capability. Our work suggests new considerations of developing versatile iron phosphate compounds as appealing anode materials for energy storage in aqueous electrolytes.",

The evolution of the sodium site occupancies, lattice and volume is shown during charge-discharge using in situ synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction data. Sodium insertion is found to occur in these electrodes during cell construction and therefore Fe[Fe(CN)6]1-x·yH2O and FeCo(CN)6 can be used as positive electrodes. NazFeFe(CN)6 electrodes feature higher reversible capacities relative to NazFeCo(CN)6 electrodes which can be associated with a combination of structural factors, for example, a major sodium-containing phase, ∼Na0.5FeFe(CN)6 with sodium locating either at the x = y = z = 0.25 or x = y = 0.25 and z = 0.227(11) sites and an electrochemically inactive sodium-free Fe[Fe(CN)6]1-x·yH2O phase.

Herein, we examine the intercalation properties of novel double sodium nickel-manganese sulfate, Na2Ni1/2Mn1/2(SO4)2, having a large monoclinic unit cell, through electrochemical and ex situ diffraction and spectroscopic methods. The sulfate salt Na2Ni1/2Mn1/2(SO4)2 is prepared by thermal dehydration of the corresponding hydrate salt Na2Ni1/2Mn1/2(SO4)2·4H2O having a blödite structure. The intercalation reactions on Na2Ni1-xMnx(SO4)2 are studied in two model cells: half-ion cell versus Li metal anode and full-ion cell versus Li4Ti5O12 anode by using lithium (LiPF6 dissolved in EC/DMC) and sodium electrolytes (NaPF6 dissolved in EC:DEC). Based on ex situ XRD and TEM analysis, it is found that sodium intercalation into Na2Ni1/2Mn1/2(SO4)2 takes place via phase separation into the Ni-rich monoclinic phase and Mn-rich alluaudite phase. The redox reactions involving participation of manganese and titanium ions are monitored by ex situ EPR spectroscopy. It has been demonstrated that manganese ions from the sulfate salt are participating in the electrochemical reaction, while the nickel ions remain intact. As a result, a reversible capacity of about 65 mA h g-1 is reached. The selective intercalation properties determine sodium nickel-manganese sulfate as a new electrode material for hybrid lithium-sodium ion batteries that is thought to combine the advantages of individual lithium and sodium batteries.",

        "abstract": "Constructing heterostructures containing multiple active components is proven to be an efficient strategy for enhancing the sodium storage capability of anode materials in sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, performance enhancement is often attributed to the unclear synergistic effects among the active components. A comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanisms on the interfaces at the atomic level remains elusive. Herein, the carbon‐coated Fe3Se4/CoSe (Fe3Se4/CoSe‐C) anode material as a model featuring atomic‐scale contact interfaces is synthesized. This unique heterogeneous architecture offers an adjustable electronic structure, which facilitates rapid reaction kinetics and enhances structural integrity. In situ microscopic and ex situ spectral characterization techniques, along with theoretical simulations, confirm that the heterointerface with strong electric fields promotes Na+ ion migration. Based on solid‐state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, an interface charge storage mechanism is revealed, resulting in the enhanced specific capacity of the anode materials. When employed as an anode in SIBs, the Fe3Se4/CoSe‐C electrode demonstrates excellent rate capabilities (218 mAh g−1 at 7 A g−1) and prolonged cycling stability (258 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1 after 1000 cycles).

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries are currently being investigated as an attractive substitute for lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries in large energy storage systems because of the more abundant and less expensive supply of Na than Li. However, the reversible capacity of Na-ions is limited because Na possesses a large ionic radius and has a higher standard electrode potential than that of Li, making it challenging to obtain electrode materials that are capable of storing large quantities of Na-ions. This study investigates the potential of CoFe2O4 synthesised via the molten salt method as an anode for Na-ion batteries. The obtained phase structure, morphology and charge and discharge properties of CoFe2O4 are thoroughly assessed. The synthesised CoFe2O4 has an octahedron morphology, with a particle size in the range of 1.1–3.6 μm and a crystallite size of ∼26 nm. Moreover, the CoFe2O4 (M800) electrodes can deliver a high discharge capacity of 839 mA h g−1 in the first cycle at a current density of 0.1 A g−1, reasonable cyclability of 98 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles and coulombic efficiency of ∼99%. The improved electrochemical performances of CoFe2O4 can be due to Na-ion-pathway shortening, wherein the homogeneity and small size of CoFe2O4 particles may enhance the Na-ion transportation. Therefore, this simple synthetic approach using molten salt favours the Na-ion diffusion and electron transport to a great extent and maximises the utilisation of CoFe2O4 as a potential anode material for Na-ion batteries.",

TAPQ cycled in diglyme-based electrolyte exhibits superior electrochemical performance, but experiences a rapid capacity fading in carbonate-based electrolyte.

        "abstract": "The development of high-performance sodium (Na) ion batteries requires improved electrode materials. The energy and power densities of Na superionic conductor (NaSICON) electrode materials are promising for large-scale energy storage applications. However, several practical issues limit the full utilization of the theoretical energy densities of NaSICON electrodes. A pressing challenge lies in the limited sodium extraction in low Na content NaSICONs, e.g., $\\rm Na_1V^{IV}V^{IV}(PO_4)_3 \\leftrightarrow V^{V}V^{IV}(PO_4)_3 + 1e^- + 1Na^+$. Hence, it is important to quantify the Na-ion mobility in a broad range of NaSICON electrodes. Using a kinetic Monte Carlo approach bearing the accuracy of first-principles calculations, we elucidate the variability of Na-ion transport vs. Na content in three important NaSICON electrodes, Na$_{\\rm x}$Ti$_{2}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{3}$, Na$_{\\rm x}$V$_{2}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{3}$, and Na$_{\\rm x}$Cr$_{2}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{3}$. Our study suggests that Na$^+$ transport in NaSICON electrodes is almost entirely determined by the local electrostatic and chemical environment set by the transition metal and the polyanionic scaffold. The competition with the ordering-disordering phenomena of Na-vacancies also plays a role in influencing Na-transport. We link the variations in the Na$^+$ kinetic properties by analyzing the competition of ligand field stabilization transition metal ions and their ionic radii. We interpret the limited Na-extraction at $x = 1$ observed experimentally by gaining insights into the local Na-vacancy interplay. We propose that targeted chemical substitutions of transition metals disrupting local charge arrangements will be critical to reducing the occurrence of strong Na$^+$-vacancy orderings at low Na concentrations, thus, expanding the accessible capacities of these electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "Carbon-based materials are the most prospective anodes. Typically, a single carbon-based material is applied to different energy storage systems (EESs) without modification. However, the microcrystal structure of carbon plays a decisive role in the energy storage performance, and therefore, it should be adjusted when applied to different EESs. Here, a hierarchical porous carbon monomer monolith (HPCM) embedded with carbon nanotubes blooming on ZIF-67 was designed as a soft-hard carbon-based freestanding thick electrode for achieving high-energy lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries. HPCM is resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) resin-derived carbon, mainly composed of hard carbon, which has outstanding mechanical properties, a high surface area, and high porosity. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) derived from ZIF-67 have extraordinary electronic conductivity, which provides soft carbon. High-temperature CO2 etching was performed to adjust the microcrystal structure, and the lithium/sodium storage performance of the electrode was evaluated. After CO2 etching, the materials lose almost half their weight (mainly hard carbon), and pseudocapacitive contribution decreases for both lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries, whereas the specific capacity increases for lithium-ion batteries and decreases for sodium-ion batteries. Capacities of 5.96 mAh cm-2 (areal) and 132.48 mAh cm-3 (volumetric) were achieved for lithium storage, and those for sodium storage were 2.31 and 51.24 mAh cm-3, respectively.

However, the initial formation of Li2O upon lithiation is essentially irreversible, which has a severe effect on the first cycle Coulombic efficiency and the reversibly achievable capacity in general.[1]It has been shown that the incorporation of transition metal dopants can address this issue, as it enables the reversible formation and reformation of Li2O.[2] The choice of the dopant, however, plays a critical role for the long-term cycling stability, rate capability, and eventual energy density of the resulting lithium-ion cells.[3]\n \n While there have been intensive studies published already on the effect of different dopants for Li-ion battery applications, targeting an optimized combination for achieving enhanced cycling performance[3] and an in-depth understanding of the reaction mechanism,[4,5] the investigation as Na-ion battery active material has not been reported so far. In fact, our results show that the reaction mechanism is fundamentally different, while the incorporation of transition metal dopants is still favorable for the eventual charge storage via sodium cations. The resulting insights into the de-/sodiation mechanism are anticipated to enable the development of further enhanced electrode active materials for sodium-ion batteries and, thus, support the recent success of this alternative battery technology.\n \n Reference\n s\n \n [1] D.

Herein, a molten-salt-assisted approach is developed to prepare crystallized Zn2GeO4 clusters constructed by interconnected nanorods, and the Na-ion storage mechanism is studied systemically through in situ X-ray diffraction, ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission microscopy associated with galvanostatic intermittent titration technique. The Zn2GeO4 anode undergoes conversion reactions followed by the alloying reaction. The large channel in the Zn2GeO4 crystal structure ensures insertion of sodium ions. The amorphous transformation during the initial discharge process increases the active site for the fast electrochemical reaction. As the anode for SIBs, the Zn2GeO4 cluster exhibits good rate capability with a capacity retention of 111.1 mA h g-1 at 20 A g-1 in half cells and 118.9 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1 in full cells, associated with a capacity of 184.2 mA h g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 after 500 cycles. The ex situ scanning electron microscopy images of the electrode material disclose that the hierarchical structure can accommodate the volume variation of Zn2GeO4 during discharge/charge cycling, facilitating long cycling stability. The investigation of Zn2GeO4 provides new insight for the development of high-rate anode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries are now close to replacing lithium-ion batteries because they provide superior alternative energy storage solutions that are in great demand, particularly for large-scale applications. To that end, the present study is focused on the properties of a new type of dual-electrode material, Na0.5Ni0.25Mn0.75O2, synthesized using a mixed hydroxy-carbonate route. Cyclic voltammetry confirms that redox couples, at high and low voltage ranges, are facilitated by the unique features and properties of this dual-electrode, through sodium ion deintercalation/intercalation into the layered Na0.5Ni0.25Mn0.75O2 material. This material provides superior performance for Na-ion batteries, as evidenced by the fabricated sodium cell that yielded initial charge-discharge capacities of 125/218 mAh g-1 in the voltage range of 1.5-4.4 V at 0.5 C. At a low voltage range (1.5-2.6 V), the anode cell delivered discharge-charge capacities of 100/99 mAh g-1 with 99% capacity retention, which corresponds to highly reversible redox reaction of the Mn4+/3+ reduction and the Mn3+/4+ oxidation observed at 1.85 and 2.06 V, respectively. The symmetric Na-ion cell, fabricated using Na0.5Ni0.25Mn0.75O2, yielded initial charge-discharge capacities of 196/187 μAh at 107 μA. These results encourage the further development of new types of futuristic sodium-ion-battery-based energy storage systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Practical aqueous zinc‐ion batteries require low‐cost thin zinc anodes with long‐term reversible stripping/depositing. However, thin zinc anodes encounter more severe issues than thick zinc, such as dendrites and uneven stripping, resulting in subpar performance and limited lifetimes. Here, this work proposes a three‐in‐one zinc anode obtained by a large‐scale two‐step method to address the above issues. In a three‐in‐one zinc anode, the copper foil as an inactive current collector solves the gradual reduction of the active area when only the pure zinc as an active current collector. This work develops an automatic electroplating device that can continuously deposit a zinc layer on a conducting foil to meet the demand for zinc‐coated copper foils. The sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)‐zinc fluoride (ZnF2) protective layer prevents direct contact between zinc and separator, and provides a uniform and sufficient supply of zinc ions. The CMC‐ZnF2‐coated copper foil performs up to 3000 reversible zinc deposition/stripping cycles with a cumulative capacity of 6 Ah cm−2 and an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.94%. The Zn||ZnVO cell using the three‐in‐one anode achieved a high capacity retention of over 70% after 15 000 cycles. The proposed three‐in‐one anode and the automatic electroplating device will facilitate industrialization of practical thin zinc anodes.",

        "abstract": "Nanosized SnO2 particles (∼2 nm in diameter) are embedded in ordered mesoporous CMK-8 carbon with unique three-dimensional interconnected pore channels and used as a sodium-ion battery (NIB) anode. Due to the CMK-8 confinement effects, the growth of SnO2 is suppressed during synthesis, leading to high material electroactivity. The CMK-8 not only serves as an electronic conducting pathway, but also creates interpenetrating tunnels, which guarantee electrolyte accessibility and thus Na+ transport throughout the electrode. Moreover, the change in the SnO2 volume during sodiation/desodiation can be accommodated by the CMK-8 framework. With a high tap density of ∼1000 mg cm-3 (vs. ∼800 mg cm-3 for the conventional NIB anode, hard carbon), the SnO2/CMK-8 anode shows a high reversible capacity of 800 mA h g-1 and excellent rate capability, delivering 330 mA h g-1 in ∼10 min.

        "title": "Improving Cycling Electrochemical Performance of P2-Type Na2/3Mn2/3Ni1/3O2 by Controlling Its Crystallinity",
        "abstract": "1. Introduction\n Na2/3Mn2/3Ni1/3O2 with P2-type structure is a positive electrode material for the sodium ion battery with relatively high reversible capacity of 170 mAh/g and average potential of 3.6 V (vs. Na/Na+). On the other hand, it is known that there is a problem in cycle stability due to the P2-O2 phase transition associated with Na insertion/removal and the structural change caused by O2 desorption at the high state of charge. In this study, we focus on the crystallinity of the layered structure to improve the electrochemical property of P2-type Na2/3(Mn2/3Ni1/3)O2 .The effect of crystallinity on the electrochemical property of the P2-Na2/3(Mn2/3Ni1/3)O2 was explored using the ball milling approach.\n \n \n \n 2. Experiments\n The Na2/3(Mn2/3Ni1/3)O2 was prepared by mixing NaOH, Mn2O3, and Ni(OH)2 in a molar ratio of 2 : 2 : 1 and firing at 950°C for 3 h in air (sintered sample). The sintered sample was ball-milled with 4 mmφ ZrO2 balls in an 80 ml ZrO2 vial using a planetary ball mill (Fritsch, P-6) at 500 rpm for 2 h to obtain a sample with low crystallinity (milled sample). The resulting samples was mixed with Ketjen black and PTFE at a weight ratio of 84:8:8, and the sheet was pressed onto an Al mesh to form an electrode. The electrodes were dried under vacuum at 220 °C for 5 hours, and then half-cells were assembled using Na foil as the counter electrode and 1M NaPF6/EC-DEC as the electrolyte to evaluate electrode characteristics. The cell was galvanostatically charged and discharged using a BLS5500 (Keisokuki Center) with a current density of 10 mA g−1, in which the denominator represents the mass of the active material in the positive electrode. The crystal structure of the samples was evaluated using XRD (Rigaku UltimaIV, Cu K-α), XAS (BL14B2 at SPring-8, BL-11, Ritsumeikan SR center), X-ray total scattering measurement (SPring-8, BL22XU, 70 keV) and TEM. In addition, the electronic structure was investigated using the first-principles calculation program (VASP) based on density functional theory.\n 3. Results and Discussion\n Fig. 1 shows XRD of Na2/3(Mn2/3Ni1/3)O2 after calcination and ball milling. The sintered sample showed a diffraction pattern attributed to the P2 structure, but the milled sample showed a broad profile and the detailed crystal structure could not be identified. However, a peak in the 002 plane around 2θ = 16° could be confirmed, and from the results of TEM observation and PDF analysis, it is considered that the milled sample also has a layered structure.\n Fig. 2 shows a comparison of charge-discharge profiles and cycle characteristics. In the charge-discharge profile of the sintered sample, potential flat areas due to Na ordering and P2-O2 phase transition can be observed, but that for the milled sample, these potential flat areas are not observed and the profile is on a slope, which indicates that the crystallinity degradation due to milling suppresses structural changes during the charge-discharge process. The initial charge-discharge capacities of the milled samples were 146 and 141 mAh/g, respectively, which were smaller than those of the calcined samples (175 and 146 mAh/g, respectively), indicating that the milling process did not significantly affect the Na insertion/desorption characteristics. Comparing the cycle characteristics shown in Fig. 2, the discharge capacity of the milled sample maintained more than 80% while the sintered sample deteriorated to the 37% of the initial capacity after 50 cycles, confirming that the milling treatment was effective in improving cycle characteristics.\n Detailed mechanism of the milling effect and redox process will be discussed in the presentation.\n \n \n \n \n \n Figure 1\n",

        "abstract": "Transition-metal diselenides have been extensively studied as desirable anode candidates for both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of their high theoretical capacities. However, it is of great challenge to achieve satisfactory cycling performance, especially for larger sodium ion storage, originated from electrode deterioration upon large volume change. Herein, we reported the construction of hierarchical tubular hybrid nanostructures through encapsulating CoSe2 nanoparticles into MoSe2/C composite shells via a simple two-step strategy including a hydrothermal method followed by vapor-phase selenization process. The unique tubular structure enables the highly reversible Li/Na storage with high specific capacity, enhanced cycling stability, and superior rate performance. It is indicated that the contribution of partial pseudocapacitive behavior greatly improves the rate capability for SIBs, where a high capacity retention of 81.5% can be obtained when the current densities range from 0.1 to 3 A g-1 (460 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 vs 379 mA h g-1 at 3 A g-1). This work provides an effective design rationale on transition-metal diselenide-based tubular nanostructures as superior hosts for both Li and Na ions, which could push forward the development of practical applications of transition-metal diselenide-based anodes in LIBs and SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfides are emerging as promising anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high theoretical capacity and low cost, their practical application yet face critical issues of sluggish kinetics and poor cycling stability. In this study, a reliable approach is introduced to overcome these challenges by fabrication of Se0.75‐Fe1‐xS0.25@SC hollow nanospheres thanks to the enriched robust Fe─S─C, C─S, and C─Se bonding, which greatly benefit for enhancing both reaction kinetics and structural stability. Kinetic study combining with in situ characterization reveals that the incorporation of rich‐Se into FeSx induces the formation of cationic Fe and Se vacancies, leading to abundant sites and optimized path for sodium storage. Density functional theory calculations also demonstrate how Se‐rich engineering weakens carbonaceous polar C─S─Fe bonds and accelerates reaction dynamics. The as‐prepared Se0.75‐Fe1‐xS0.25@SC can deliver a high reversible capacity of 515 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 over 1250 cycles and achieve superior rate capability with maintaining capacity of 418 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1.

The VS4 nanorods electrodes exhibit high specific capacity in EC/DMC electrolytes. A theoretical calculation confirms the advance of EC/DMC electrolytes for VS4 nanorods. Significantly, the discharge capacity of VS4/RGO nanocomposites remains 100 mAh/g after 2000 cycles at a large current density of 2 A/g, indicating their excellent cycling stability. The nanocomposites can improve the electronic conductivity and reduce the Na+ diffusion energy barrier, thereby effectively improving the sodium storage performance of the hybrid material.

Hybrid-ion capacitors are a novel kind of capacitor-battery hybrid energy storage device that has earned a lot of interest because of their high power density while maintaining energy density and a long lifecycle. Mostly, lithium-based energy storage technology is now being studied for use in electric grid storage. But the price increment and intermittent availability of lithium reserves make lithium-based commercialization unstable. Therefore, sodium-based technologies have been proposed as potential substitutes for lithium-based technologies. Sodium-ion capacitors (SICs) are acknowledged as potential innovative energy storage technologies which have lower standard electrode potentials and lower costs than lithium-ion capacitors. However, the large radius of the sodium ion also contributes to unfavorable reaction kinetics, low energy density, and brief lifespan of SICs. Recently, transition metal oxide (TMO)-based candidates have been considered potential due to the large theoretical capacity, environmental friendliness, and low cost for SICs. This brief study summarizes current advancements in research of TMOs and sodium-based TMOs as electrode candidates for SIC applications. Also, we have covered in detail the state of the exploration and upcoming prospects of TMOs for SICs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have been one of the most promising alternatives for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for large-scale energy storage systems due to cost-efficiency and rich resources of sodium. However, graphite, a commercial anode material of LIBs, shows a very low reversible capacity for sodium-ion storage because of the weak binding between sodium and graphite. Herein, an activated graphite (AG) material with abundant defects including edges and vacancies with oxygenic functional groups is well-designed and fabricated by a facile and eco-friendly ball-milling method. The structural evolutions during the ball-milling process and their effects on electrochemical sodium-ion storage performance are investigated. A stable reversible capacity of 139.1 mA h g-1 can be achieved at 1.0 A g-1 even after 4500 cycles for the AG-50 electrode with the 50-hour ball-milling treatment, amounting to a very low decay ratio of 0.0034% per cycle. Based on physical characterizations and density functional theory calculations, the greatly improved specific capacity and cycling stability of the AG anode for sodium-ion storage can be attributed to the enlarged interlayer space, increased specific surface area, and introduced defects caused by ball-milling treatment, which provide vast active sites for reversible sodium-ion storage based on a adsorption/desorption mechanism, thus leading to great improvement in the specific capacity of the AG electrode.

In this study, a simple and effective strategy is reported to weaken and degrade this process by engineering the intensified surface and near‐surface reactions, which is realized by making use of a sandwich‐type nanoarchitecture composed of graphene as electron channels and few‐layered MoS2 with expanded interlayer spacing. The unique 2D sheet‐shaped hierarchical structure is capable of shortening the ion diffusion length, while the few‐layered MoS2 with expanded interlayer spacing has more accessible surface area and the decreased ion diffusion resistance, evidenced by the smaller energy barriers revealed by the density functional theory calculations. Benefiting from the shortened ion diffusion distance and enhanced electron transfer capability, a high ratio of surface or near‐surface reactions is dominated at a high discharge/charge rate. As such, the composites exhibit the high capacities of 152 and 93 mA h g−1 at 30 and 50 A g−1, respectively. Moreover, a high reversible capacity of 684 mA h g−1 and an excellent cycling stability up to 4500 cycles can be delivered. The outstanding performance is attributed to the engineered structure with increased contribution of surface or near‐surface reactions.",

OEMs are attractive because of their molecular adjustability, flexible nature, green resources, and low-environmental footprint. However, the nature of electronic insulation and solubility in organic electrolytes degrade the battery performance of OEMs. In order to address these challenges, we have concluded and applied useful strategies (i.e., molecular and morphological engineering) to achieve fast ionic/electronic conductivity and stability in the cycling process. Molecular engineering includes mitigating the number and kinds of redox-active centres to enhance the specific capacity, grafting electron-withdrawing/donating groups to adjust the working voltage, increasing the degree of polymerization to decrease the solubility, extending the conjugated structure to enhance the electronic conductivity, and so on. Morphological engineering is regarding to conceive 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D OEMs for optimizing the ionic and electronic conducting pathway. In a word, through molecular and morphological engineering, OEMs could be promising electrode materials for high performance MIBs.\n \n Figure caption: The chemical molecular structure, morphology, and the types of OEM-based batteries with the illustration of molecular and morphological engineering strategies.\n \n \n \n \n \n Figure 1\n",

        "abstract": "Electrochemical cells that utilize metals (e.g., lithium, sodium, zinc) as anodes are under intense investigation as they are projected to replace the current lithium‐ion batteries to serve as a more energy‐dense option for commercial applications. In addition, metal electrodes provide opportunities for fundamental research of different phenomena, such as ion transport and electrochemical kinetics, in the complex environment of reactive metal‐electrodeposition. In this work, computationally and experimentally the competing effects related to transport and kinetics during the metal electrodeposition process are examined. Using Brownian dynamics simulations, it is shown that slower deposition kinetics results in a more compact and uniform Li morphology. This finding is experimentally implemented by designing ion‐containing polymeric coatings on the electrodes that simultaneously provide pathways for lithium‐ion transport, while impeding the charge transfer (Li+ + e− → Li) at heterogeneous surfaces. It is further shown that these ionic polymer interfaces can significantly extend the cell‐lifetime of a lithium metal battery in both ether‐based and carbonate‐based electrolytes. Through theoretical and experimental investigations, it is found that a low kinetic to transport rate ratio is a major factor in influencing the Li plating morphology. The plating morphology can be further fine‐tuned by increasing ionic conductivity.",

        "abstract": "The prolonged life expectancy accelerates the development of implantable bioelectronic devices. However, conventional batteries with limited lifetime, rigid architecture, and inferior energy density greatly restrict their applications in patient's body. Herein, a novel flexible symmetric Na-ion microbattery based on the heteronanomat electrode and the biocompatible electrolyte has been developed. The film electrodes with sphere-in-network architecture are synthesized by simultaneously electrospinning and electrospraying followed by carbonization. The combined technologies allow a uniform incorporation of active materials/C spheres into the carbon nanofiber matrix, which results in the heteronanomat electrodes with robust structure, fast electron/ion transport, and compact mass loading. The flexible microbatteries are fabricated based on the interdigitated microelectrodes and the biocompatible electrolytes, which provides a new implantable power source for bioelectronics. As a proof-of-concept study, the symmetric sodium-ion microbatteries are constructed from the heteronanomat bifunctional electrodes (based on Na2VTi(PO4)3) and the biocompatible electrolyte. The high reversibility, fast kinetics, and high energy density of the symmetric system in the biocompatible electrolytes reveal their superior performance in bioenvironments. Moreover, the high capacity retention (over 98%) and the high stability of microbattery implanted in a living SD rat for a month further demonstrate its high reliability for long-term in vivo diagnosis. Therefore, this work not only presents a new sphere-in-net heteronanomat structure for fabricating high-performance electrode but also gives significant contributions to develop high-energy-density and high safety biocompatible power sources of implantable bioelectronics.",

The composition and evolution of the SEI in Na2Ti3O7 electrodes is hereby studied by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). To overcome typical XPS limitations in the photoelectron energy assignments, the analysis of the Auger parameter is here proposed for the first time in battery materials characterization. We have found that the electrode/electrolyte interface formed upon discharge, mostly composed by carbonates and semicarbonates (Na2CO3, NaCO3R), fluorides (NaF), chlorides (NaCl) and poly(ethylene oxide)s, is unstable upon electrochemical cycling. Additionally, solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies prove the reaction of the polyvinylidene difluoride (PVdF) binder with sodium. The powerful approach used in this work, namely Auger parameter study, enables us to correctly determine the composition of the electrode surface layer without any interference from surface charging or absolute binding energy calibration effects. As a result, the suitability for Na-ion batteries of binders and electrolytes widely used for Li-ion batteries is questioned here.",

In this paper, we design a rational strategy to improve the sodium storage performance of red phosphorus by in situ coating of a polydopamine layer on phosphorus-carbon nanotube hybrid (P-CNT@PD) via a self-polymerization of dopamine under weak base conditions. The in situ generated PD coating can provide an elastic buffer for accommodating the volume change of active materials and prevent their direct contact with the electrolyte. Due to the conductive and elastic PD coating, the P-CNT@PD composite presents a high rate capacity (1060 mA h g-1 at the second discharge and 730 mA h g-1 after 2000 cycles at 2.6 A g-1) and excellent cycling stability (470 mA h g-1 after 5000 cycles at 5.2 A g-1) as an anode for sodium ion batteries.

        "abstract": "A new orthophosphate α-Na2Ni2Fe(PO4)3 was synthesized using a solid state reaction route, and its crystal structure was determined from powder X-ray diffraction data. The physical properties of α-Na2Ni2Fe(PO4)3 were studied by magnetic and electrochemical measurements and by Mössbauer and Raman spectroscopy. α-Na2Ni2Fe(PO4)3 crystallizes according to a stuffed α-CrPO4-type structure with the space group Imma and the cell parameters a = 10.42821(12), b = 13.19862(15), c = 6.47634(8) Å, and Z = 4. The structure consists of a 3D-framework of octahedra and tetrahedra sharing corners and/or edges with channels along [100] and [010], in which the sodium atoms are located. The (57)Fe Mössbauer spectrum indicates that the Fe(3+) cation is distributed over two crystallographic sites implying the presence of a Ni(2+)/Fe(3+) statistical disorder. Magnetic susceptibility follows the Curie-Weiss behavior above 100 K with θ = -114.3 K indicating the occurrence of predominant antiferromagnetic interactions. Electrochemical tests indicate that during the first discharge to 1 V vs. Na(+)/Na in a sodium cell, one Na(+) ion could be inserted into the α-Na2Ni2Fe(PO4)3 structure. This has led to the formation of a new phase Na3Ni2Fe(PO4)3 which was found to be promising as a positive electrode material for sodium batteries. When α-Na2Ni2Fe(PO4)3 is further discharged to 0.03 V, it delivers a capacity of 960 mA h g(-1). This corresponds to the intercalation of more than seven sodium atoms per formula unit which is an indication of a conversion-type behaviour with the formation of metallic Fe and Ni. When cycled in the voltage range 0.03-3 V vs. Na(+)/Na, at 20 °C, under the current rates of 50, 100, 200, and 400 mA g(-1), reversible capacities of 238, 196, 153, and 115 mA h g(-1), were obtained, respectively.",

Herein, we report a facile solvothermal synthesis of NaTi2(PO4)3 nanocages constructed by iso-oriented tiny nanocrystals with a mesoporous architecture.

When assembled with commercial activated carbon to an SIC, the system delivers an energy density of 56 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 39 W kg-1. Even at a high current rate of 5 A g-1 (corresponds to finish a full charge/discharge process in 2 min), the SIC still works well after 20 000 cycles without obvious capacity degradation. With the merits of impressive energy/power densities and longevity, the obtained hybrid capacitor should be a promising device for highly efficient energy storage systems.",

Herein, a MoSe2 /Cr2 Se3 heterojunction uniformly embedded is fabricated in nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanospheres (MoSe2 /Cr2 Se3 @N-HCSs) as an electrode material for SIBs and KIBs. Cr2 Se3 exhibits spontaneous antiparallel alignment of magnetic moments. Mo2+ doping is employed to regulate the electron spin states of Cr2 Se3 . Moreover, the MoSe2 and Cr2 Se3 heterojunctions induce a lattice mismatch at the heterostructure interface, resulting in spin-polarized states or localized magnetic moments at the interface, potentially contributing to spin-polarized surface capacitance. MoSe2 /Cr2 Se3 @N-HCSs demonstrate a high capacity of 498 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 with good cycling stability (capacity of 405 mAh g-1 and a coulombic efficiency of 99.8% after 1000 cycles). Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations simulate the accumulation of spin-polarized charges at the MoSe2 /Cr2 Se3 @N-HCSs heterojunction interface, dependent on the surface electron density of the antiferromagnetic Cr2 Se3 and the surface spin polarization near the Fermi level. After regulating the electron spin states through Mo-doping, the band gap of the material decreases.

In particular, the activation energy of Na+ ion migration in the double phase is estimated to be as low as 0.28 eV, which is the lowest value among the SIB electrodes developed so far, and this can be attributed to the wide tunnel structure. In addition, we verify their potentiality for use as anode materials in lithium ion batteries (LIBs) by exploring their properties upon Li insertion. Since these compounds are predicted to be promising anode materials for SIBs or LIBs by our calculations, we believe that our findings will promote further experimental studies.",

        "abstract": "\n \n The high costs and geopolitical challenges inherent to the lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery supply chain have driven a rising interest in the development of sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries as a potential alternative. Unfortunately, the larger ionic radius of Na limits the reversibility of cycling because of the extensive atomic rearrangements that accompany Na-ion insertion, which in turn limit diffusion and charging speed, and lead to rapid degradation of the electrodes. The Center for Strain Optimization for Renewable Energy (STORE) was established to address these challenges and develop new electrode materials for Na-ion cells. This article discusses the current state-of-the-art materials used in Na-ion cells and several directions that STORE believes are critical to understand and control the structural and volumetric changes during the reversible (de)insertion of large cations.\n \n \n \n \n \n Understanding the fundamental way materials respond to localized strains at the atomic length-scale is a critical first step in the development of highly reversible, long cycle life, Na-ion insertion hosts. This perspective explores a variety of methods that can be employed to mitigate the detrimental effects of large strain. The insights gained from these investigations should help lay the foundation for the creation of more economical and sustainable batteries that could have immediate impact on global energy infrastructure.\n \n \n Although there is near universal agreement that electrochemical energy storage must be an integral part of a green-energy future, there is less agreement about how to reduce the cost of energy storage. Replacing high-cost lithium-ion cells with lower-cost sodium-ion batteries is one option frequently considered in future energy models, but the details of what can be achieve with optimized sodium cell performance remains unclear. Here we posit that developing methods to mitigating strain on the electrode particle length scale is a key factor for achieving long-cycle-life sodium-ion batteries. Mitigating strain on the atomic scale suppress electrode-level volume change. Allowing for fast cycling in materials without the problems of electrode cracking or delamination. We further posit that understanding volume change in sodium-ion electrodes at a fundamental level will lead to the designing new sodium-ion electrode materials that will allow for efficient, stable, lower-cost energy storage.\n",

        "abstract": "The reserves of sodium resources are much larger than those of lithium resources, and they are widely distributed and easy to produce and can be widely used in photovoltaic energy storage and other industries on the premise of this advantage. However, how to produce hard carbon anodes at a low cost for the preparation of energy storage materials requires continuous exploration and experimentation to find the optimal solution. Here, we used waste sour date shell biomass as a precursor for a hard carbon anode obtained by simple acid treatment and two pyrolyses. It is shown that acid washing after prepyrolysis has a significant effect on the electrochemical performance of the sour date shell-derived hard carbon (ZJ), constructing a stable structure that makes it easier for sodium ions to be embedded and dislodged, and the carbon particles are homogeneous and free of bonding and electrode cracking. The ZJ-1500-HCl pyrolyzed at 1500 °C has a high reversible capacity of 329.1 mAh g-1, 94.1% initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), 90.54% capacity retention efficiency cycling 300 cycles at a current density of 300 mA g-1, and a resistivity below 10 Ω. It has good cycle stability and a good multiplier performance. It is expected to be used in practical production and photovoltaic energy storage in the future.",

Herein, we successfully synthesized an accordion-like Nb2CTx MXene, whose crystal structure integrity and lamellar separation have been confirmed by characterization methods like high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). Combined with solid Na and K and liquid K-Na alloy as anodes, the Nb2CTx MXene shows excellent electrochemical performance, such as high capacity retention after large current shock in tests of rate performance and long time stability for more than 500 cycles, etc. Also, the Nb2CTx MXene coupled with liquid K-Na anode performs better than that coupled with solid K for the dendrite-controlling character of the liquid electrode.

The composite shows a much higher surface area than the pure nano-Sn reference sample, due to the porous higher surface area of PPy and the much smaller size of Sn in the nano-Sn/PPy composite than in the pure tin nanoparticle sample. Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) were also used as binders, and the electrochemical performance was investigated. The electrochemical results show that both the capacity retention and the rate capability are in the same order of nano-Sn/PPy-CMC > nano-Sn/PPy-PVDF > nano-Sn-CMC > nano-Sn-PVDF. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results show that CMC can prevent the formation of cracks in electrodes caused by the big volume changes during the charge-discharge process, and the PPy in the composite can provide a conducting matrix and alleviate the agglomeration of Sn nanoparticles. The present results indicate that the nano-Sn/PPy composite could be suitable for the next generation of anode materials with relatively good capacity retention and rate capability.",

The significance of different reaction parameters and specific growth mechanism for the formation of particles is elaborated. The DNA-ZnWO4 nanoassemblies have been used in two potential applications for the first time, namely, supercapacitor and catalysis studies. Supercapacitor study revealed that DNA-ZnWO4 nanoassemblies exhibited good electrochemical properties having high specific capacitance value ∼72 F/g at 5 mV s(-1), and electrodes possessed a good cyclic stability with more than 1000 consecutive times of cycling. Catalysis studies have been done for benzyl alcohol oxidation, and it was observed that DNA-ZnWO4 nanoassemblies having smaller diameter gives better catalytic efficiency compared to other morphology. This is further authenticated from their BET surface area analysis. In the future, the self-assembled DNA-ZnWO4 nanoassemblies could be a promising candidate for the synthesis of other mixed metal oxides and should be applicable in various emerging fields like Li ion batteries or photocatalysis, or as luminescent materials.",

Here, we present a novel monodisperse fluffy alluaudite Na0.67FePO4, prepared by a modified solvothermal method, as promising electrode for sodium ion battery. This porous Na0.67FePO4 with nanocactus-like morphology is composed by nanorods within an open three-dimensional structure. This unique nanocactus-based morphology offers three important advantages when used as electrode for sodium ion battery: (i) provides an open frame structure for a large Na+ ions transport; (ii) reduces the sodium ion and electron transport path by ≈20 nm; (iii) offers a large surface area for a more efficient interface between the electrode and the electrolyte. The electrochemical investigation revealed that this fluffy Na0.67FePO4 nanocactus exhibits the high discharge capacity of 138 mAh g(-1). Moreover, a battery with a Na0.67FePO4/CNT hybrid electrode delivered a discharge capacity as high as ≈143 mAh g(-1), coupled to an excellent stable cyclability (no obvious capacity fading over 50 cycles at a current rate of 5 mA g(-1)). This enhanced mechanism was studied by means of absorption measurements and ex situ XAFS characterizations. Results of the characterization of the Na0.67FePO4 suggests that the outstanding performance can be associated with the unique fluffy nanocactus morphology.",

Physicochemical characterization and desalination experiments show that the NFHFC-2 with minimized defects possesses enhanced electrochemical activity of Fe2+ and electrochemical kinetics, thus achieving higher desalination performance (specific capacity of 75.0 mA h g-1 and capacity retention of 85.3% after 50 cycles). Furthermore, a symmetrical NFHCF-2 RCDB is assembled, and the operation parameters (including various salinities and electrode spacing) are optimized to achieve a remarkable salt removal capacity (SRC) of 108.9 mg g-1 and a salt removal rate (SRR) of 2.22 mg g-1 min-1 with low energy consumption (0.056 kW h kg-1-NaCl) and outstanding cycling stability (almost no capacity attenuation in 150 cycles). Impressively, the RCDB further exhibits favorable technical feasibility in the simultaneous removal of univalent/bivalent ions from the natural seawater.

Recently, it was also shown that this class of materials shows great prospects towards sodium ion batteries. Yet, bulk SiOCs are still severely restricted with regard to their electrochemical performance. In the course of this work, a novel and facile strategy towards the synthesis of mesoporous and carbon-rich SiOC will be presented. To achieve this goal, 4,4′-bis(triethoxysilyl)-1,1′-biphenyl was sol–gel processed in the presence of the triblock copolymer Pluronic P123. After the removal of the surfactant using Soxhlet extraction the organosilica material was subsequently carbonized under an inert gas atmosphere at 1000 °C. The resulting black powder was able to maintain all structural features and the porosity of the initial organosilica precursor making it an interesting candidate as an anode material for both sodium and lithium ion batteries. To get a detailed insight into the electrochemical properties of the novel material in the respective battery systems, electrodes from the nanostructured SiOC were studied in half-cells with galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements. It will be shown that nanostructuring of SiOC is a viable strategy in order to outperform commercially applied competitors.",

Nanostructured carbon materials are attracting great interest as high-performance anodes for SIBs. Herein, a simple and fast technique to prepare carbon nanofibers (CNFs) is presented, and the effects of carbonization conditions on the morphology and electrochemical properties of CNF anodes in Li- and Na-ion batteries are investigated. Porous CNFs containing graphene were fabricated via centrifugal spinning, and MoS2 were decorated on graphene-included porous CNFs via hydrothermal synthesis. The effect of MoS2 on the morphology and the electrode performance was examined in detail. The results showed that the combination of centrifugal spinning, hydrothermal synthesis, and heat treatment is an efficient way to fabricate high-performance electrodes for rechargeable batteries. Furthermore, CNFs fabricated at a carbonization temperature of 800 °C delivered the highest capacity, and the addition of MoS2 improved the reversible capacity up to 860 mAh/g and 455 mAh/g for Li- and Na-ion batteries, respectively. A specific capacity of over 380 mAh/g was observed even at a high current density of 1 A/g.

        "abstract": "Metallic Na (K) are considered a promising anode materials for Na‐metal and K‐metal batteries because of their high theoretical capacity, low electrode potential, and abundant resources. However, the uncontrolled growth of Na (K) dendrites severely damages the stability of the electrode/electrolyte interface, resulting in battery failure. Herein, a heterogeneous interface layer consisting of metal vanadium nanoparticles and sodium sulfide (potassium sulfide) is introduced on the surface of a Na (K) foil (i.e., Na2S/V/Na or K2S/V/K). Experimental studies and theoretical calculations indicate that a heterogeneous Na2S/V (K2S/V) protective layer can effectively improve Na (K)‐ion adsorption and diffusion kinetics, inhibiting the growth of Na (K) dendrites during Na (K) plating/stripping. Based on the novel design of the heterogeneous layer, the symmetric Na2S/V/Na cell displays a long lifespan of over 1000 h in a carbonate‐based electrolyte, and the K2S/V/K electrode can operate for over 1300 h at 0.5 mA cm–2 with a capacity of 0.5 mAh cm–2. Moreover, the Na full cell (Na3V2(PO4)3||Na2S/V/Na) exhibits a high energy density of 375 Wh kg–1 and a high power density of 23.5 kW kg–1. The achievements support the development of heterogeneous protective layers for other high‐energy‐density metal batteries.",

        "abstract": "Metal polyphosphides are regarded as the ideal anode candidates for sodium storage because of their high theoretical capacity, reasonable potential, and abundant resource alternative. However, most of them suffer from irreversibility problems, as reflected by their low reversible capacity, inferior Coulombic efficiency (CE), low rate capability, and poor cycling stability. In this work, we systematically compare the electrochemical behavior of a variety of polyphosphides bulks, discovering that the CuP2 bulks have higher initial reversible capacity (416 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1) and CE (74%) compared to the FeP2, CoP3, and NiP2 bulks, which is related to the unique crystal structure of CuP2. The CuP2 electrode is optimized by the rational design of encapsulating CuP2 nanoparticles into three-dimensional graphene networks (CuP2@GNs), leading to excellent electrochemical performance. In the carbonate electrolyte, the CuP2@GNs electrode can deliver the reversible capacities of up to 804, 736, 685, 621, and 508 mAh g-1 at 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 A g-1, respectively, along with a first CE of 66%. The reversible capacity can be up to 737 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 with a first CE of 83% in the ether electrolyte. These excellent performance demonstrates that CuP2@GNs could be a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Tin (Sn)-based anodes for sodium (Na)-ion batteries possess higher Na-storage capacity and better safety aspects compared to hard carbon -based anodes but suffer from poor cyclic stability due to volume expansion/contraction and concomitant loss in mechanical integrity during sodiation/desodiation. To address this, the usage of nanoscaled electrode-active particles and nanoscaled-carbon-based buffers has been explored, but with compromises with the tap density, accrued irreversible surface reactions, overall capacity (for \"inactive\" carbon), and adoption of non-scalable/complex preparation routes. Against this backdrop, anode-active \"layered\" bismuth (Bi) has been incorporated with Sn via a facile-cum-scalable mechanical-milling approach, leading to individual electrode-active particles being composed of well-dispersed Sn and Bi phases. The optimized carbon-free Sn-Bi compositions, benefiting from the combined effects of \"buffering\" action and faster Na transport of Bi, to go with the greater Na-storage capacity and lower operating potential of Sn, exhibit excellent cyclic stability (viz., ∼83-92% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 1C) and rate capability (viz., no capacity drop from C/5 to 2C, with only ∼25% drop at 5C), despite having fairly coarse particles (∼5-10 μm). As proven by operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction and stress measurements, the sequential sodiation/desodiation of the components and, concomitantly, stress build-ups at different potentials provide \"buffering\" action even for such \"active-active\" Sn-Bi compositions. Furthermore, the overall stress development upon sodiation of Bi has been found to be significantly lower than that of Sn (by a factor of ∼3.8), which renders Bi promising as a \"buffer\" material, in general. Dissemination of such complex interplay between electrode-active components during electrochemical cycling also paves the way for the development of high-performance, safe, and scalable \"alloying-reaction\"-based anode materials for Na-ion batteries and beyond, sans the need for ultrafine/nanoscaled electrode particles or \"inactive\" nanoscaled-carbon-based \"buffer\" materials.",

The collisions among electrons are dramatically decreased; in turn, the thermal stability of the battery is improved via the tailored orientation of active materials. A stable protective solid-state electrolyte interface film is formed via the photogenerated electrons and the magnetohydrodynamics effect, depressing the growth of sodium dendrites. The porous three-dimensional heterostructure is conducive for promoting transmission of charges and the diffusion of ions, effectively reducing the local current density of metals, further inhibiting the growth of sodium dendrites during deposition and peeling processes. Density functional theoretical calculations also verify that the fabricated MoS2 composite possesses intensified electron density, and exhibits fast reaction kinetics in repeated cycles and lowered sodium adsorption energy. The optical field and the rational magnetic fabrication technology can fundamentally solve the bottleneck problems restricting the development of batteries, mitigating the energy crisis.",

The covalent bridged bonds of Mo–S–C, Mo–O–C and C–O–S provide an effective charge transfer path between MoS2 and graphene, facilitating fast charge hopping and improving rate performance.

        "abstract": "The mechanical stability of aqueous binder and conductive composites (BCC) is the basis of the long-term service of composite electrodes in advanced secondary batteries. To evaluate the stress evolution of BCC in composite electrodes during electrochemical operation, we established an electrochemical–mechanical model for multilayer spherical particles that consists of an active material and a solid-electrolyte-interface (SEI)-enclosed BCC. The lithium-diffusion-induced stress distribution was studied in detail by coupling the influence of SEI and the viscoelasticity of inorganic-filler-doped polymeric bonding material. It was found that tensile hoop stress plays a critical role in determining whether a composite electrode is damaged or not—and circumferential cracks may primarily initiate in BCC, rather than in other electrode components. Further, the peak tensile stress of BCC is at the interface with SEI and does not occur at full lithiation due to the relaxation nature of polymer composite. Moreover, mechanical damage would be greatly misled if neglecting the existence of SEI. Finally, the structure integrity of the binder and conductive system can be effectively improved by (1) increasing the carbon black content as much as possible in the context of meeting cell capacity requirements—it is greater than 27% and 50% for sodium alginate and the mixtures of carboxy styrene butadiene latex and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, respectively, for composite graphite anode; (2) reducing the elastic modulus of SEI to less than that of BCC; (3) decreasing the lithiation rate.",

However, it is still a great challenge to develop suitable electrode materials due to the large radius of Na+. This work demonstrates a strategy to synthesize hierarchical tubular MoS2 via a facial hydrothermal method with the assistance of tetramethylammonium bromide (TMAB). The results show that sufficient amounts of TMA+ ions are necessary to form the hierarchical tubular structures of MoS2. The obtained tubular MoS2 displays a high diffusion coefficient of Na+ ions, a high specific capacity of 652.5 mAh/g at the current density of 100 mA/g after 50 cycles, and a good cycling stability (94.2% of the initial capacity can be retained after 100 cycles at 1000 mA/g). In situ XRD during the discharge/charge process displays a reversible intercalation/deintercalation of Na+ into MoS2 layers followed by a conversion-type reaction. Systematic analyses reveal that the enhanced electrochemical performance is attributed to its tubular hierarchical structures with the wall composed of loosely stacked nanosheets, which can provide nearly unobstructed ion transportation paths, sufficient active sites, and enough space to mitigate the effects of the volume change during the discharge/charge process. This synthetic approach can be easily extended to other metal oxides and metal sulfides with hierarchical structures for versatile applications.",

Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising anode materials for SIBs due to their high theoretical capacities. However, their severe volume expansions and low electronic conductivity impede their practical developments. In addition, the synthesis of energy storage materials from waste biomass has aroused extensive attention. Herein, we synthesize WS2 nanocrystals embedded in N and P co-doped biochar via a facile bio-sorption followed by sulphurization, employing waste chlorella as the adsorbent and bio-reactor. The WS2 nanocrystals are beneficial for storing more sodium ions and expediting the transportation of sodium ions, thus improving the capacity and reaction kinetics. Chlorella acts as a reactor and not only inhibits the stacking of WS2 nanocrystals during the synthesis process but also alleviates the mechanical pressure of composite during the charge/discharge process. As a result, the WS2/NPC-2 electrode delivers a high specific capacity (436 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1) and superior rate performance of 311 mA h g-1 at 3 A g-1 for SIBs. It also exhibits excellent stability even up to 6000 cycles at 5 A g-1, which is one of the optimal long-cycle properties reported for WS2-based materials to date.",

Transformations in the bulk materials, such as phase transitions, can be directly observed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), while X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) gives information about the local electronic and geometric structures (e.g. changes in redox states and bond lengths). In situ experiments carried out on operating cells are particularly useful because they allow direct correlation between the electrochemical and structural properties of the materials. These experiments are time-consuming and can be challenging to design due to the reactivity and air-sensitivity of the alkali metal anodes used in the half-cell configurations, and/or the possibility of signal interference from other cell components and hardware. For these reasons, it is appropriate to carry out ex situ experiments (e.g. on electrodes harvested from partially charged or cycled cells) in some cases. Here, we present detailed protocols for the preparation of both ex situ and in situ samples for experiments involving synchrotron radiation and demonstrate how these experiments are done.",

        "title": "Functionalization: An Effective Approach to Open and Close Channels for Electron Transfer in Nitrogenated Holey Graphene C2N Anodes in Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Electron transfer plays a crucial role in energy storage materials, such as metal-ion batteries (MIBs). Numerous approaches have been developed to facilitate the electron transfer for MIBs, and most of them extend the special surface areas, which promotes the contact between metal ions and the electrodes. Herein, we report the formation of intramolecular channels for electron transfer to open and close intermolecular channels in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) through functionalization, modulating the cell performance of two-dimensional (2D) nitrogenated holey graphene C2N anodes. This also activates the inactive metal ions in the anodes, reducing their production costs. Upon increasing the concentration of hydrogen atoms, the intramolecular electron transfer increases, lowering the intermolecular electron transfer between C2N and metal ions and thus weakening their interaction and reducing the capacities of the anodes. A high concentration of hydrogen atoms introduced in C2N would further promote the intramolecular electron transfer and block the channels for intermolecular electron transfer. For functionalized C2N monolayers that can be used as anodes in SIBs, they possess high specific capacities, high conductivities, and low open-circuit voltages. This work proposes the fabrication of 2D energy storage materials with tunable macroscale behaviors (e.g., performance) through the relationships between the macroscale and microscale levels and between intramolecular and intermolecular electron transfer.",

A glide path was made up to a #15 K-file, and then, a ProTaper gold rotary instrument was used for preparation up to S1. Platinum wire electrodes, connecting wires, and a 9 V battery were used to form a circuit. Saline, 3% sodium hypochlorite, 17% EDTA liquid, and acidified hydrogen peroxide (HCl 10 g/L + H2O2 100 g/L) were all used to submerge the endoblocks. The samples were assessed for dissolution time using a stopwatch, and electrochemical studies were performed for corrosion analysis of different irrigants.\n \n \n \n The fastest dissolution of the files was observed with sodium hypochlorite (2 min 47 s), followed by acidified hydrogen peroxide (9 min 36 s). The presence of chloride ions in electrolyte solutions has been shown to be a factor directly affecting the rate of dissolution. EDTA demonstrated resilience to corrosion. The electrochemical studies confirmed a corrosion affinity with NaOCl and acidified hydrogen peroxide.\n \n \n \n The best solutions for dissolving stainless-steel K-files are sodium hypochlorite and acidified hydrogen peroxide. For clinical application and assessment of soft tissue effects, more studies are required. Although electrochemical dissolution has potential, it needs to be further studied before it can be used in therapeutic settings.\n",

        "abstract": "The lack of anodes stability is one among key barriers to the widespread commercialization of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). This is attributed to graphite, a well‐known common anode material for a range of commercial batteries including lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), which limits the insertion of sodium (Na) ions due to their large ionic size. Tin (Sn) has shown its potential as a suitable anode material because it exhibits high capacities in conversion and alloying reactions. However, it endures significant volumetric expansion and slower reaction rates during sodiation. To overcome these challenges, this work presents a novel anode material for SIBs where a 2D layered architecture of Sn with a hard carbon (HC) buffer layer is engineered using physical vapor deposition technique. This novel anode (SnHT/HC) exhibits a high initial capacity of 470 mAhg−1 and an exceptional retention of 438 mAhg−1 after 3000 cycles at 0.2C, with 99 % Coulombic efficiency. SnHT/HC testing at varying fast charge and discharge C‐rate of 5C, 10C, 15C, and 50C has shown promising results. Better electron transport and reduced volumetric changes are perceived to enhance the overall performance of SnHT/HC electrodes.",

The CNT sheets have been characterized thoroughly using various microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. The addition of sulfur improves the interplanar spacing in the lattice and also generated abundant defects. The silicon oxides help in enhancing the specific capacity of the CNT sheet via conversion reactions. These features lead to enhanced electrochemical properties and the best performance has been demonstrated by the co‐loaded CNT/S/silicon oxide electrode. As anode in LIB, it delivers 830 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 current density after 250 cycles. More importantly, the kinetic analysis confirms that sulfur/silicon oxide co‐loading can improve the Li+ diffusion coefficient in CNT anode and enhance the metal ion storage. The structural modifications also enhance Na+ ion storage and the CNT/S/Silicon oxide anode delivers 368 mAh g−1 after 250 cycles at a current rate of 1 A g−1 with a superior initial coulombic efficiency of 77.5%.",

The obtained PTCDA-Na active substance has a porous honeycomb structure, showing a large specific surface area. Moreover, after recombination with graphene, the dispersion and specific surface area of PTCDA-Na are further enhanced, and more active sites are exposed and conductivity is improved. As a result, the PTCDA-Na-G composite electrode materials exhibit superior electrochemical energy storage behaviors. The initial charge capacity of the PTCDA-Na-G electrode is 890.5 mA h g−1, and after 200 cycles, the capacity can still remain at 840.0 mA h g−1 with a high retention rate of 94.3%, which is much larger than those of the PTCDA-Na electrode. In addition, at different current densities, the PTCDA-Na-G electrode also presents higher capacities and better cycle stability than the PTCDA-Na electrode. Compared with PTCDA-Na with a porous honeycomb structure and previously reported sodium carboxylic acid salts with a large size bulk structure, the PTCDA-Na-G composite material prepared in this work shows superior electrochemical energy storage properties due to its large specific surface area, high dispersion, more exposed active sites and large electrical conductivity, which would provide new ideas for the development of high performance organic electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Metal sulfides show promise for use in alkali‐ion batteries because of their high theoretical capacities. However, their poor cycling stability and rate performance hinder their further development. To avoid these issues, In2S3 into Sb2S3 is introduced to improve its electrochemical properties by optimizing its crystal structure and sodium storage mechanism. A heterostructure composed of In2S3 and Sb2S3 shows a unique morphology of formicary microspheres, which provide abundant channels for fast transfer of sodium ions, large surface area for a high pseudocapacitance effect, and enough voids to relieve volume expansion. A sodium‐ion battery containing the bimetallic sulfide anode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 400 mA h g−1 and long cycle life of about 1000 cycles. Similarly, a high capacity of ≈610 mA h g−1 is achieved for a lithium‐ion battery containing the anode. During sodiation/desodiation, the synergistic effect of In2S3 and Sb2S3 enhances electronic conductivity and supports the host structure, preventing collapse. The cycling performance and rate performance of the In2S3–Sb2S3 anode are further improved by wrapping the electrode with carbon nanotubes. Even at a high current density of 3.2 A g−1, this carbon composite structure still shows a capacity of about 355 mA h g−1.",

We find that Na intercalation follows the two-phase reaction mechanism, that is, trigonal prismatic 2H-MoS2 → octahedral 1T-NaMoS2, and the phase boundary is ∼2 nm thick. The velocity of the phase boundary at <10 nm/s is 1 order smaller than that of lithium diffusion, suggesting sluggish kinetics for sodium intercalation. The newly formed 1T-NaMoS2 contains a high density of defects and series superstructure domains with typical sizes of ∼3-5 nm.

In this system, ions are removed not only by charging steps but also by discharging steps, and it is possible to treat actual seawater with this system because the Prussian blue material has a high charge capacity with a reversible reaction of alkaline cations. Here, we demonstrate a rocking chair desalination battery to desalt seawater, and the results show that this system has a high desalination capacity (59.9 mg/g) with efficient energy consumption (0.34 Wh/L for 40% Na ion removal efficiency).",

        "abstract": "Spinel lithium titanate (LTO; Li4Ti5O12) is one of the promising materials for negative electrodes of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The stable charge-discharge performance of SIB cells using LTO electrodes depends on the reversible Na insertion-extraction mechanism of LTO, where the spinel lattice is expanded with Na insertion, and two phases, Na-inserted LTO (Na-LTO) and Li-inserted LTO (Li-LTO) phases, are generated. These phases are confirmed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), while the mechanism of the two-phase coexistence with different lattice volumes is yet unclear. Here, we investigate the detailed morphology of the coexisting Na-LTO and Li-LTO phases using in situ XRD measurements and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation. Na-LTO (a = 8.74 Å) and Li-LTO (a = 8.36 Å) phases are confirmed in both the electrochemically formed Na-inserted LTO electrode and the single-crystalline LTO thin specimen. We observed that the Na-LTO/Li-LTO interface is parallel to the (001) plane, and contains an inevitable lattice mismatch along the interface, while the expansion of the Na-LTO phase can be partially relaxed normal to the interface. We observed that the Na-LTO/Li-LTO interface has interface layers of lattice disordering with a 1-2 nm width, relaxing the lattice mismatch, as opposed to results from the previous scanning TEM observation. How the different lattice volumes at the two-phase interface are relaxed should be the key issue in investigation of the mechanism of Na insertion and extraction in LTO electrodes.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have increasingly been considered as an attractive alternative to lithium-ion batteries for large-scale applications. High specific capacity and suitable working potential anode materials are one of the keys to search for future developments. Here, a novel and stable sodium titanate/carbon-black phosphorus (NTO/C-BP) hybrids are first fabricated as a promising anode material for advanced sodium-ion batteries. Under the protection of argon (Ar) atmosphere, the direct high-energy mechanical milling of the BP nanoparticle and NTO/C results in the formation of NTO/C-BP hybrids. In other words, the BP nanoparticle can be interconnected with bare NTO by P-O-Ti bonds and/or form stable P-C bonds with the carbon coating layer on the surface of NTO. The NTO/C-BP hybrids are not only beneficial for enhancing specific capacity but also have a great protective effect on the exposure of BP to air by the synergistic effect between BP and NTO/C. The results show that the NTO/C-BP hybrids can deliver very high specific capacity (∼225 mA h g-1 after 55 cycles at 20 mA g-1, ∼183 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g-1). It is expected from these scientific findings that forming stable P-C bonds and P-O-Ti bonds in this work can serve as a guidance to other Ti-based and P-based electrode materials for practical large-scale application of sodium-ion batteries.",

Given the complexity of these systems, it is good practice to begin the study with simpler models and progressively advance to more complex configurations, all while maintaining an understanding of the physical principles governing solid-state battery operation. The results presented in this work pertain to cells without traditional electrodes, thus providing a foundation for guiding the development of fully functional solid-state cells. The open circuit voltage (OCV) of the Cu/Na2.99Ba0.005ClO composite in a cellulose/Zn pouch cell achieves 1.10 V, reflecting the difference in the chemical potentials of the current collectors (CCs), Zn and Cu, serving as electrodes. After 120 days, while set to discharge, conversely to what was expected, a higher potential difference of 1.13 V was attained (capacity of 5.9 mAh·g−1electrolyte). By incorporating a layer of carbon felt, the OCV became 0.85 V; however, after 95 days, the potential difference increased to 1.20 V. Ab initio simulations were additionally performed on a Cu/Na3ClO/Zn heterojunction showing the formation of dipoles and the Na deposition on Zn which is demonstrated experimentally. The sodium plating on the negative CC (Zn) takes place as the cell is set to discharge at room temperature but is not observed at 40 °C.",

In this system, sodium ions and anions are captured/released by the metal oxide and carbon electrodes, respectively. The hybrid Capmix extracted an energy density that was approximately three times higher (130 J m-2 ) and exhibited a notable power output (97 mW m-2 ) compared to the previous Capmix using ion-exchange membranes. Furthermore, the hybrid system operated successfully with real river water and seawater.

Specifically, the Sb2S3@C rods electrode presents greatly enhanced electrochemical properties, resulting from the introduction of thin carbon layers which can effectively alleviate the strain caused by the large volume change and simultaneously improve the conductivity of electrode during cycling.

        "abstract": "The spontaneous increase for advanced energy materials to meet consumer requirements demands the designing of smart, high-performing materials for fabricating next-generation energy devices. The requirement is not only for smart materials but also for manufacturing alternative devices to the rapidly exhausting lithium-based batteries. Currently, sodium-based metal-ion batteries (SIBs) emerged as an alternative to lithium batteries, which also require novel designs of electrodes for achieving high performance. Bridging the gap between theory and realization in SIB development is a significant challenge. A combination of carbon and metal sulfides has been widely reported as a promising electrode structure for SIBs. However, the performance, durability and processing time of such structures have to be improved for practical applications. Considering the importance of electrode designing for battery systems, plasma and thermal processing techniques have been employed to create advanced smart hybrid materials for high-performing SIBs. Plasma produces vertical carbon nanofibers (VCN) directly on a conductive substrate and anchors them with molybdenum. Later, thermal processing was employed to convert them to corresponding metal sulfides. Such designed binder-free composite anode consisting of vertical carbon nanofiber/molybdenum sulfide (VCN/MoS2) nanostructures. The vertically aligned morphology of the binder-free VCN/MoS2 hybrid composites facilitates electrolyte penetration and shortens ion diffusion channels. The direct contact between the VCN to the current collector improves ion/electron conductivity for the electrode. These advantageous features enable the binder-free VCN/MoS2 hybrid composite electrodes to exhibit superior electrochemical properties when used as an anode for SIBs, including exceptional rate capability with a specific discharge capacity of 403 mA h g–1 at a high current density of 3200 mA g–1. These findings could open up the efficient designing of smart hybrid electrodes using green techniques for next-generation energy storage systems.",

In this work, zinc ferrite (ZnFe2O4) nanospheres have been prepared by the simple hydrothermal route and the structural analysis of ZnFe2O4 was evaluated by using X-ray diffraction. The morphology and microstructural characterizations are obtained using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The results indicate that a single phase material was obtained with uniform sphere-like morphology and high crystallinity. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method was employed to determine the specific surface area of the ZnFe2O4 nanospheres which has been calculated to be 32 m2 g−1. The electrochemical results indicate that the composite possesses high sodium storage capability (478 mA h g−1), and good cycling stability (284 mA h g−1 at 100th cycle) and rate capability (78 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1). The high sodium storage performance of the ZnFe2O4 electrode is ascribed to the mesoporous nature of the ZnFe2O4 nanospheres. Further, sodium kinetics and the reaction mechanism in ZnFe2O4 nanospheres have been elucidated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, ex situ TEM, and XAS. The acquired results indicate sluggish kinetics, reversibility of the material, and the stable structure of ZnFe2O4.

The electrochemical properties of the material were studied in carbonate and ether-based electrolytes (EBE). The results showed that the material had a longer cycle life and better rate capability in EBE. This excellent electrochemical performance was attributed to a low apparent activation energy and a low overpotential for Na deposition in EBE, which improved the electrode kinetic properties. Furthermore, EBE suppressed side reactions of the electrode and electrolyte, which avoided the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase film.",

        "abstract": "Disordered carbons are promising anode materials for sodium ion batteries. However, a major drawback of these materials is their low Coulombic efficiency in the first cycles, which indicates parasitic reactions. Such reactions can be supressed by alumina coating on the surface of the anodic materials; more ions are then available for electrochemical activity, and less electrolyte solution is lost. On the other hand, some pores and surface edge sites are passivated by the coating and are no longer available for reversible reaction with sodium ions, hence their contribution is eliminated, leading to reduction in specific capacity. We show herein that electrochemical insertion of sodium ions into carbon anodes prior to alumina coating has double positive effect on anode perfomances, meaning, preventing passivation and maintaining high specific capacity. We show that the artificial layer still prevented parasitic reactions, while the pores and surface edge sites retained electrochemical activity. The capacity values were thus restored and even became higher due to preventing the development of a surface layer. UPS measurements assessed the energetic states of the electrodes and confirmed that the alumina coating forms a barrier for interfacial electron transfer from the electrode to the solution at any polarization stage.",

However, the large ion radius of Na brings about a series of challenging thermodynamic and kinetic difficulties to the electrodes for sodium-storage, including low reversible capacity and low ion transport, as well as large volume change. To mitigate or even overcome the kinetic problems, we develop a self-assembly route to a novel architecture consisting of nanosized porous NASICON-type NaTi2(PO4)3 particles embedded in microsized 3D graphene network. Such architecture synergistically combines the advantages of a 3D graphene network and of 0D porous nanoparticles. It greatly increases the electron/ion transport kinetics and assures the electrode structure integrity, leading to attractive electrochemical performance as reflected by a high rate-capability (112 mAh g(-1) at 1C, 105 mAh g(-1) at 5C, 96 mAh g(-1) at 10C, 67 mAh g(-1) at 50C), a long cycle-life (capacity retention of 80% after 1000 cycles at 10C), and a high initial Coulombic efficiency (>79%).

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) Sc2 C, an example of a MXene, has been attracting extensive attention due to its distinctive properties and great potential in applications such as energy storage. In light of its high capacity and fast charging-discharging performance, Sc2 C exhibits significant potential as an anode material for lithium- and sodium-ion batteries. Herein, a systematic investigation of Li/Na atom adsorption and diffusion on Sc2 C planes was performed based on density functional calculations. The metallic character of pristine and adsorbed Sc2 C ensures desirable electric conductivity, which indicates the advantages of 2D Sc2 C for lithium- and sodium-ion batteries. A significant charge transfer from the Li/Na atoms to Sc2 C is predicted, which indicates the cationic state of the adatoms. In addition, the diffusion barriers are as low as 0.018 and 0.012 eV for Li and Na, respectively, which illustrates the high mobility and cycling ability of Sc2 C. In particular, each formula unit of Sc2 C can adsorb up to two Li/Na atoms, which corresponds to a relatively high theoretical capacity of 462 or 362 mAh g-1 . The average electrode potential was calculated to be as low as 0.32 and 0.24 V for stoichiometric Li2 Sc2 C and Na2 Sc2 C, respectively, which makes Sc2 C attractive for the overall voltage of the cell. Herein, our results suggest that Sc2 C could be a promising anode candidate for both lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries.",

Currently, there are still difficulties in research anode materials that can insert/extract Na/K ions quickly and stably. Herein, the sulfur-rich (NH4)2Mo3S13 is proposed as the anode for SIBs/PIBs and is obtained by a hydrothermal method. The sulfur-rich (NH4)2Mo3S13 with a three-dimensional structure shows a high capacity and long lifespans for Na+ (at 10 A g-1 the capacity of 165.2 mAh g-1 after 1100 cycles) and K+ (120.7 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 retained after 500 cycles) storage. In addition, the (NH4)2Mo3S13 electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance at low temperatures (0 °C). The mechanism of Na+ storage in (NH4)2Mo3S13 can be innovatively revealed through the combined use of electrochemical kinetic analysis and a series of ex situ characterization tests. It is believed that the present work identifies (NH4)2Mo3S13 as a promising anode for the SIBs/PIBs and will be of broad interest in research on engineering sulfur-rich transition metal sulfide and on energy storage devices.",

Among these, gravure is very attractive as a low-cost and low-waste production method for functional layers in different fields, such as energy, sensors, and biomedical, because it is easy to scale up industrially. Thanks to our research, the feasibility of gravure printing was recently proved for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) manufacturing. Such studies allowed the production of high-quality electrodes involving different active materials with high stability, reproducibility, and good performance. Going beyond lithium-based storage devices, our attention was devoted on the possibility of employing highly sustainable gravure printing for sodium-ion batteries (NaBs) manufacturing, following the trendy interest in sodium, which is more abundant, economical, and ecofriendly than lithium. Here a study on gravure printed anodes for sodium-ion batteries based on hard carbon as an active material is presented and discussed. Thanks to our methodology centered on the capillary number, a high printing quality anodic layer was produced providing typical electrochemical behavior and good performance. Such results are very innovative and relevant in the field of sodium-ion batteries and further demonstrate the high potential of gravure in printed battery manufacturing.",

        "abstract": "Operando X-ray diffraction (XRD) and total scattering investigations of battery electrode materials allow us to relate structure and electrochemical properties down to the atomic level. By studying the materials under real working conditions without allowing the materials to relax or react outside the battery, we obtain the most reliable possible structural information. Unfortunately, in most operando experiments, even when we use heavily modified cells to remove barriers to our probe radiation, the signal from the material of interest is significantly obscured by contributions from other battery components. The problems are increased when we seek to study electrode materials which either are, or become, amorphous during battery cycling: removing non-sample contributions is an essential part of pre-processing total scattering data for pair distribution function (PDF) analysis, which can reveal the local structures of non-crystalline materials.\n To address these problems, we have developed operando total scattering computed tomography (TSCT) as a method for obtaining clean, 5-dimensional (3-D space, time, and chemical structure) information on working batteries. The method allows us to select specific areas of the active electrode and obtain XRD and PDF information without any contributions from other components of the battery. The high-quality of the resulting data has allowed us to understand the cycling mechanisms of poorly scattering, amorphous, alloying anode materials (sodium cycling in phosphorus)[1], and complex, multi component, conversion-alloying systems (lithium cycling in bismuth vanadate)[2]. While the first example mainly uses the focusing power of TSCT to obtain the best possible data, the latter case uses the spatial resolution of the data to identify signs of a longer-term deactivation mechanism based on agglomeration of the nanoclusters of active material during repeated cycling. Further studies are currently in progress to apply the method to other difficult anode systems including silicon.\n [1] J. Sottmann, M. Di Michiel, H. Fjellvåg, L. Malavasi, S. Margadonna, P.

        "abstract": "The development of sodium ion batteries (NIBs) can provide an alternative to lithium ion batteries (LIBs) for sustainable, low-cost energy storage. However, due to the larger size and higher m/e ratio of the sodium ion compared to lithium, sodiation reactions of candidate electrodes are expected to differ in significant ways from the corresponding lithium ones. In this work, we investigated the sodiation mechanism of a typical transition metal-oxide, NiO, through a set of correlated techniques, including electrochemical and synchrotron studies, real-time electron microscopy observation, and ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We found that a crystalline Na2O reaction layer that was formed at the beginning of sodiation plays an important role in blocking the further transport of sodium ions. In addition, sodiation in NiO exhibits a \"shrinking-core\" mode that results from a layer-by-layer reaction, as identified by ab initio MD simulations. For lithiation, however, the formation of Li antisite defects significantly distorts the local NiO lattice that facilitates Li insertion, thus enhancing the overall reaction rate. These observations delineate the mechanistic difference between sodiation and lithiation in metal-oxide conversion materials. More importantly, our findings identify the importance of understanding the role of reaction layers on the functioning of electrodes and thus provide critical insights into further optimizing NIB materials through surface engineering.",

        "abstract": "Fe3O4 is widely investigated as an anode for ambient sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), but its electrochemical properties in the wide operation‐temperature range have rarely been studied. Herein, the Fe3O4 nanoparticles, which are well encapsulated by carbon nanolayers, are uniformly dispersed on the graphene basal plane (named Fe3O4/C@G) to be used as the anode for SIBs. The existence of graphene can reduce the size of Fe3O4/C nanoparticles from 150 to 80 nm and greatly boost charge transport capability of electrode, resulting in an obvious size decrease of superparamagnetic Fe nanoparticles generated from the conversion reaction from 5 to 2 nm. Importantly, the ultra‐small superparamagnetic Fe nanoparticles (≈2 nm) can induce a strong spin‐polarized surface capacitance effect at operating temperatures ranging from −40 to 60 °C, thus achieving highly efficient Na‐ion transport and storage in a wide operation‐temperature range. Consequently, the Fe3O4/C@G anode shows high capacity, excellent fast‐charging capability, and cycling stability ranging from −40 to 60 °C in half/full cells. This work demonstrates the viability of Fe3O4 as anode for wide operation‐temperature SIBs and reveals that spin‐polarized surface capacitance effects can promote Na‐ion storage over a wide operation temperature range.",

        "abstract": "Metal sulfides, one kind of electrode material with very high theoretical capacity, have been widely studied for use in lithium and sodium ion batteries. However, there are some problems hindering their applications in electrodes, such as low conductivity and volume expansion. The MOF introduces metals with different coordination strengths into an existing MOF structure, which improves the performance of the electrode to a certain extent. In this paper, Fe/Zn bimetallic MOF rod-like superstructure was prepared based on Ostwald theory. Accompanied by sulfuration, the MOF was effectively combined with MoS2 and GO, and the objective materials Fe7S8-C/ZnS-C@MoS2/rGO composites were successfully prepared. The MOF material provides a good frame and an efficient electron transport path, while the robust rGO wall effectively inhibits the pulverization of materials during the lithium/sodium intercalation/escalation courses. This particular material exhibited excellent cycling and rate capability performance when used in Li/Na-ion batteries. When used in Li-batteries, the electrode material delivered a specific capacity of 1598.3 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and remained at 1196.7 mA h g-1 even after about 100 cycles and further exhibited a specific capacity of 368.68 mA h g-1 at the current rate of 5 A g-1 even after 1000 cycles, respectively. As for sodium batteries, these electrode materials exhibited an initial reversible capacity of 1053.6 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and the reversible capacity was still as high as 592.2 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles. It is perhaps that this composite material with its particular architecture and composition is greatly beneficial for electron transfer and Li/Na ion diffusion. In the repeated physicochemical/nutrifying process, the appropriate distance between adjacent MOFs is of great help in preventing volume changes and thus improving the electrochemical performance.",

The in situ formation of iron hydroxide nanoparticles (Fe(OH)x NPs) of various weights on the surface of graphene oxide, followed by thermal treatment at elevated temperature and washing using hydrochloric acid, furnished 3D graphene. The characterization studies confirmed the prevention of graphene layer stacking by over 90% compared with thermal treatment without Fe(OH)x. The electrochemical performance of the 3D graphene was evaluated as a counter electrode for lithium metal and sodium metal in a half-cell configuration. This material showed good performances with a charging capacity of 507 mA h g-1 at 372 mA g-1 in Li-ion batteries and 252 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 in Na-ion batteries, which is 1.4 and 1.9 times higher, respectively, than the graphene prepared without Fe(OH)x templates.",

        "abstract": "Tin (Sn) is considered to be an ideal candidate for the anode of sodium ion batteries. However, the design of Sn-based electrodes with maintained long-term stability still remains challenging due to their huge volume expansion (≈420%) and easy pulverization during cycling. Herein, a facile and versatile strategy for the synthesis of nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dot (GQD) edge-anchored Sn nanodots as the pillars into reduced graphene oxide blocks (NGQD/Sn-NG) for ultrafast and ultrastable sodium-ion storage is reported. Sn nanodots (2-5 nm) anchored at the edges of \"octopus-like\" GQDs via covalent SnOC/SnNC bonds function as the pillars that ensure fast Na-ion/electron transport across the graphene blocks. Moreover, the chemical and spatial (layered structure) confinements not only suppress Sn aggregation, but also function as physical barriers for buffering volume change upon sodiation/desodiation. Consequently, the NGQD/Sn-NG with high structural stability exhibits excellent rate performance (555 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and 198 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 ) and ultra-long cycling stability (184 mAh g-1 remaining even after 2000 cycles at 5 A g-1 ). The confinement-induced synthesis together with remarkable electrochemical performances should shed light on the practical application of highly attractive tin-based anodes for next generation rechargeable sodium batteries.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries are commanding increasing attention owing to their promising electrochemical performance and sustainability. Organic electrode materials (OEMs) complement such technologies as they can be sourced from biomass and recycling them is environmentally friendly. Organic anodes based on sodium carboxylates have exhibited immense potential, except the limitation of current synthesis methods concerning upscaling and energy costs. In this work, a rapid and energy efficient microwave‐assisted synthesis for organic anodes is presented using sodium naphthalene‐2,6‐dicarboxylate as a model compound. Optimizing the synthesis and electrode composition enables the compound to deliver a reversible initial capacity of ≈250 mAh g–1 at a current density of 25 mA g–1 with a high initial Coulombic efficiency (≈78%). The capacity is stable over 400 cycles and the compound also exhibits good rate performance. The successful demonstration of this rapid synthesis may facilitate the transition to preparing organic battery materials by scalable, efficient methods.",

        "abstract": "In electrode preparation, graphene-based electrodes usually form a uniaxially oriented stacking structure, which limits the Na+ diffusion in graphene electrodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). In this work, a crumpled graphene (CG) anode with graded interlayer spacings was synthesized, and CG exhibits high-rate performance for SIBs. The CG has a folding microstructure like a paper clip that facilitates rapid adsorption/desorption of Na+ on its surface so that the diffusion kinetics of Na+ could be improved. The x-ray absorption fine structure and transmission electron microscope proved the mechanism of Na+ co-adsorption and explained the reason for its high-rate performance. When the three-dimensional CG is used as the anode of SIBs, it has a high-rate performance of 146 mAh g−1 with the current density increasing to 1 A g−1, and CG still maintained about 79 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 with good structural stability.",

        "abstract": "Additives in the electrolyte solution of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have a large impact on the performance of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that forms on the anode and is a key to the stability and durability of LIBs. We theoretically investigated effects of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), a representative additive, that has recently attracted considerable attention for the enhancement of cycling stability of silicon electrodes and the improvement of reversibility of sodium-ion batteries. First, we intensively examined the reductive decompositions by ring-opening, hydrogen fluoride (HF) elimination to form a vinylene carbonate (VC) additive and intermolecular chemical reactions of FEC in the ethylene carbonate (EC) electrolyte, by using density functional theory (DFT) based molecular dynamics and the blue-moon ensemble technique for the free energy profile. The results show that the most plausible product of the FEC reductive decomposition is lithium fluoride (LiF), and that the reactivity of FEC to anion radicals is found to be inert compared to the VC additive. We also investigated the effects of the generated LiF on the SEI by using two model systems; (1) LiF molecules distributed in a model aggregate of organic SEI film components (SFCs) and (2) a LiF aggregate interfaced with the SFC aggregate. DFT calculations of the former system show that F atoms form strong bindings with the Li atoms of multiple organic SFC molecules and play as a joint connecting them. In the latter interface system, the LiF aggregate adsorbs the organic SFCs through the F-Li bindings. These results suggest that LiF moieties play the role of glue in the organic SFC within the SEI film. We also examined the interface structure between a LiF aggregate and a lithiated silicon anode, and found that they are strongly bound. This strong binding is likely to be related to the effectiveness of the FEC additive in the electrolyte for the silicon anode.",

        "abstract": "\n Li-ion batteries often use transition metal oxide (TMO) positive electrodes. Sodium-based analogs are also an excellent option for all-solid-state sodium-based batteries. However, combining TMOs with solid electrolytes is challenging, both being rigid in nature. In this work, we use a polymeric secondary electrolyte to combine a sodium manganese oxide composite positive electrode with a sodium-beta alumina solid electrolyte (BASE) to an all-solid-state sodium battery. The composite electrode exhibits intimate interface contact with the solid electrolyte and well-established intra-electrode conduction pathways because mechanical flexible poly(ethylene oxide) acts as an ionically conducting auxiliary agent. The composite electrode shows an ionic conductivity of 5.5∙10-6 S cm-1 at 80°C. The careful co-treatment of the Na|BASE interface, resulting in a superior cycling stability of 1000 h at 0.35 mA cm-2 in a symmetric cell, enhances sodium´s wettability to the BASE surface. The full cell achieves an initial discharge capacity of 80 mAh g-1 at an average voltage of 2.78 V vs. Na+/Na, corresponding to a specific energy of 155 Wh kg-1 (positive electrode). Hence, we provide a proof-of-concept for all-solid-state cells, which paves the way for numerous combinations of well-conducting polymeric secondary electrolytes with TMO active materials and BASE.",

        "title": "Synthesis and Structure–Property Relationships of Polyimide Covalent Organic Frameworks for Carbon Dioxide Capture and (Aqueous) Sodium-Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an emerging material family having several potential applications. Their porous framework and redox-active centers enable gas/ion adsorption, allowing them to function as safe, cheap, and tunable electrode materials in next-generation batteries, as well as CO2 adsorption materials for carbon-capture applications. Herein, we develop four polyimide COFs by combining aromatic triamines with aromatic dianhydrides and provide detailed structural and electrochemical characterization. Through density functional theory (DFT) calculations and powder X-ray diffraction, we achieve a detailed structural characterization, where DFT calculations reveal that the imide bonds prefer to form at an angle with one another, breaking the 2D symmetry, which shrinks the pore width and elongates the pore walls. The eclipsed perpendicular stacking is preferable, while sliding of the COF sheets is energetically accessible in a relatively flat energy landscape with a few metastable regions. We investigate the potential use of these COFs in CO2 adsorption and electrochemical applications. The adsorption and electrochemical properties are related to the structural and chemical characteristics of each COF, giving new insights for advanced material designs. For CO2 adsorption specifically, the two best performing COFs originated from the same triamine building block, which—in combination with force-field calculations—revealed unexpected structure–property relationships. Specific geometries provide a useful framework for Na-ion intercalation with retainable capacities and stable cycle life at a relatively high working potential (>1.5 V vs Na/Na+). Although this capacity is low compared to conventional inorganic Li-ion materials, we show as a proof of principle that these COFs are especially promising for sustainable, safe, and stable Na-aqueous batteries due to the combination of their working potentials and their insoluble nature in water.",

        "abstract": "The sub‐10 nm metal‐based nanomaterials (SMNs) show great potential for the electrochemical energy storage field. However, their ion storage capacity and stability suffer from severe agglomeration and interface problems. Herein, a universal strategy is reported to synthesize a wide range of SMNs (e.g., metal, nitride, oxide, and sulfides) embedded in free‐standing carbon foam (SMN/FC‐F) composite electrodes by crossing the interfacial confinement of NaCl self‐assembly with the thermal‐mechanical coupling of powder metallurgy. The pressure‐enhanced NaCl self‐assembly interfacial confinement is greatly beneficial to preventing SMN agglomeration and promoting SMNs embedded in FC‐F which originate from the welding of carbon nanosheets. They are confirmed via a series of advanced characterizations including X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and spherical aberration‐corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, with theoretical computations. Benefiting from the unique structure, SMNs/FC‐F delivers ultrafast and stable ion‐storage kinetics. As a proof‐of‐concept demonstration, the MoS2/FC‐F shows excellent ion storage kinetics and superior long‐term cycling performance for ion storage (e.g., Na3V2(PO4)2O2F/C//MoS2/FC‐F sodium‐ion batteries exhibit a high reversible capacity of 185 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with a decay rate of 0.05% per cycle.).

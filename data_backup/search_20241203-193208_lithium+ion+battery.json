        "title": "Identifying the positive role of lithium hydride in stabilizing Li metal anodes",
        "abstract": "Lithium hydride has been widely identified as the major component of the solid-electrolyte interphase of Li metal batteries (LMBs), but is often regarded as being detrimental to the stabilization of LMBs. Here, we identify the positive and important role of LiH in promoting fast diffusion of Li ions by building a unique three-dimensional (3D) Li metal anode composed of LiMg alloys uniformly confined into graphene-supported LiH nanoparticles. The built-in electric field at the interface between LiH with high Li ion conductivity and LiMg alloys effectively boosts Li diffusion kinetics toward favorable Li plating into lithiophilic LiMg alloys through the surface of LiH. Therefore, the diffusion coefficient of Li ions of the thus-formed 3D structured Li metal anode is 10 times higher than the identical anode without the presence of LiH, and it exhibits a long cycle life of over 1200 hours at 3 mA cm−2 under 5 mA hour cm−2.",

        "abstract": "The polymer electrolytes are considered to be an alternative to liquid electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries because of their high thermal stability, flexibility, and wide applications. However, the polymer electrolytes have low ionic conductivity at room temperature due to the interfacial contact issue and the growing of lithium dendrites between the electrolytes/electrodes. In this study, we prepared gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) through an in situ thermal-induced cationic ring-opening strategy, using LiFSI as an initiator. As-synthesized GPEs were characterized with a series of technologies. The as-synthesized PNDGE 1.5 presented good thermal stability (up to 150 °C), low glass transition temperature (Tg < −40 °C), high ionic conductivity (>10−4 S/cm), and good interfacial contact with the cell components and comparable anodic oxidation voltage (4.0 V). In addition, PNGDE 1.5 exhibited a discharge capacity of 131 mAh/g after 50 cycles at 0.2 C and had a 92% level of coulombic efficiency. Herein, these results can contribute to developing of new polymer electrolytes and offer the possibility of good compatibility through the in situ technique for Li-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "\n In recent years, lithium-ion batteries have grown in popularity. Because of their extended cycle life and high energy density. A hexagon-shaped 18650 lithium-ion cylindrical cell battery pack was created using paraffin wax (PA) as a Phase change material (PCM) and nano-enhanced phase change material (Ne-PCM). However, the PCM's low thermal conductivity is a main challenge to the improvement of electrical vehicles (EVs). The highest temperature in the cylindrical cell battery pack is attained in the mid-region, resulting in an uneven temperature distribution across the cells. In order to overcome the constraints and achieve efficient battery module performance, phase change with nanomaterials was placed in the center of four cells using graphene platelet nano powder (GPN), multi-wall carbon nano tubes (MWCNTs), and graphite-synthetic powder (GSP). Studies on the battery module were conducted without, with PCM, and Ne-PCM cooling. The investigation found that the battery pack with Ne-PCM performed well by keeping the temperature under 50 °C at different discharge rates of 1C, 2C, and 3C and maintaining a uniform temperature variation within cells. Ne-PCM decreases the temperature differential between the modules at 1, 2, and 3 C discharge rates by 85.49, 91.47, and 84.21%, respectively, in comparison to PCM.",

        "abstract": "Cation-doped cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 is regarded as a promising solid electrolyte for safe and energy-dense solid-state lithium batteries. However, it suffers from the formation of Li2CO3 and high electronic conductivity, which give rise to an unconformable Li/Li7La3Zr2O12 interface and lithium dendrites. Herein, composite AlF3-Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 solid electrolytes were created based on thermal AlF3 decomposition and F/O displacement reactions under a high-temperature sintering process. When the AlF3 is thermally decomposed, it leaves Al2O3/AlF3 meliorating the grain boundaries and F- ions partially displacing O2- ions in the grains. Due to the higher electronegativity of F- in the grains and the grain-boundary modification, these AlF3-Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 deliver optimized electronic conduction and chemical stability against the formation of Li2CO3. The Li/AlF3-Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12/Li cell exhibits a low interfacial resistance of ∼16 Ω cm2 and an ultrastable long-term cycling behavior for 800 h under a current density of 200 μA/cm2, leading to Li//LiCoO2 solid-state batteries with good rate performance and cycling stability.",

        "title": "Temperature coefficients of Li-ion battery single electrode potentials and related entropy changes - revisited.",
        "abstract": "Usually the potentials of Li-ion battery electrodes (at constant temperature) are expressed against metallic lithium, assuming that it equals zero. In the case of potential temperature coefficients, and hence entropies, no similar assumption can be applied, as it is against the third principle of thermodynamics. Here, single electrode potential temperature coefficients were estimated using a 'negligible thermal diffusion potential assumption'. The open circuit voltage (Δφi) dependence on temperature T, for three Li-ion battery cathodes, was measured in non-isothermal symmetrical cells (both electrodes had the same composition but were kept in different temperatures). The measured values were interpreted as single cathode (LiMn2O4, LiFePO4 and LiCoO2) potential temperature coefficients dφi/dT, assuming that Soret and Thomson effects are negligible. The single cathode potential temperature coefficients, estimated in such a way, were positive (dφ(LiMn2O4)/dT = 0.86 mV K-1, dφ(LiFePO4)/dT = 0.86 mV K-1 and dφ(LiCoO2)/dT = 0.83 mV K-1). In addition to the measurements in non-isothermal cells, the temperature coefficients of the open circuit voltage of isothermal cells consisting of these cathodes and a metallic lithium reference (dE/dT) were determined. In this case, all temperature coefficients of the cell voltage were negative (dE(Li|LiMn2O4)/dT = -0.20 mV K-1, dE(Li|LiFePO4)/dT = -0.08 mV K-1 and dE(Li|LiCoO2)/dT = -0.25 mV K-1). The temperature coefficient of the single metallic-lithium electrode, dφLi/dT, was calculated from the temperature coefficients dE/dT of isothermal cells consisting of the cathodes and a lithium counter-electrode and the dφi/dT values measured in non-isothermal cells: dE/dT = dφi/dT - dφLi/dT. The dφLi/dT value was 1.03 mV K-1. The measured difference in the dφ/dT values for metallic lithium and graphite (LiC6) anodes was small (dE/dT = dφ(C6Li)/dT - dφLi/dT = -0.08 mV K-1). Literature data on the temperature coefficients of the isothermal cell open circuit voltage containing different electrodes at different states of charge (SOC) and metallic-lithium counter electrodes were used for the calculation of single electrode properties, taking into account that dφLi/dT = 1.03 mV K-1. The temperature coefficients of all single electrodes were positive for different SOC values and ranged between 1.69 mV K-1 and 0.84 mV K-1. The values of entropy change, ΔSi, for reversible single electrode reactions were all positive (for different states of charge) and ranged between ca. 70 J mol-1 K-1 and 120 J mol-1 K-1.",

Herein, we introduce a novel dual metal (oxide) microsphere reinforced by vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and covered with a titanium oxide metal ion transfer diffusion layer. The CNTs penetrate the oxide particles and buffer structural volume change, while enhancing electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, the external TiO2-C shell serves as a transport pathway for mobile metal ions (e.g., Li+) and acts as a protective layer for the inner oxides by reducing the electrolyte/metal oxide interfacial area and minimizing side reactions. The proposed design is shown to significantly improve the stability and Coulombic efficiency (CE) of metal (oxide) anodes. For example, the as-prepared MnO-CNTs@TiO2-C microsphere demonstrates an extremely high capacity of 967 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles, where a CE as high as 99% is maintained. Even at a harsh rate of 5 A g-1 (ca. 5C), a capacity of 389 mAh g-1 can be maintained for thousands of cycles. The proposed oxide anode design was combined with nickel-rich cathode to make a full-cell battery that works at high voltage and exhibits impressive stability and life span.",

While some attribute this decline to device aging, a significant portion of the population lacks awareness of the precise factors contributing to diminished battery efficiency. Consequently, the research investigates the factors related to battery performance, aiming to identify the determinants of reduced efficiency. Decision trees are used to meticulously analyze the intricate relationships between variables and discern the factors that respondents perceive as causative of diminished battery performance. This algorithm is chosen since, in predicting high-capacity lithium-ion battery performance, the decision tree outperforms other algorithms in machine learning in accuracy. The study elucidates diverse user preferences, with 55.38% favoring Android and 44.62% expressing a preference for iOS, indicating disparate perceptions of battery health: 61.54% consider their batteries as \"Good,\" while 38.46% acknowledge a decline. The decision tree analysis of 195 participants underscores the pronounced impact of prolonged usage on battery health, revealing that 95% maintain good battery performance. In contrast, 27.69% of Android users face reduced battery performance, emphasizing the need for targeted user education and Android manufacturers to prioritize device longevity. The ultimate objective is to give readers a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of battery performance in the context of device aging and its contributing factors and give some input to manufacturers and service providers. ",

        "abstract": "The conversion reaction-based lithium-sulfur battery features an attractive energy density of 2600 W h/kg. Nevertheless, the unsatisfied performance in terms of poor discharge capacity and cycling stability still hinders its practical applications. Recently, porous carbon materials have been widely reported as promising sulfur reservoirs to promote the sluggish reaction kinetics of sulfur conversion, tolerate volume expansion of sulfur, and suppress polysulfide shuttling. However, porous carbon with a simply designed nanostructure is hard to satisfy all of these aspects simultaneously. Herein, we have applied a dual-template strategy that assembles carbon pores into carbon sheets to prepare three-dimensional (3D) nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets (N-PCSs) as the multifunctional sulfur host for the Li-S battery. By arranging carbon pores within an interconnected 3D architecture, the porous carbon sheets enable rapid electron/ion transfer. Moreover, the micro/mesopores and nitrogen dopant in N-PCS provide both physical and chemical restrictions to polysulfide species. With these advances, the N-PCS/S cathode delivers a large initial discharge capacity of 1360 mA h/g at 0.1 C. When performed at 0.5 C for 1000 cycles, the cathode can still remain ∼50% of its capacity with a low decay rate of 0.05% per cycle, showing the important role of the 3D carbon material in the Li-S battery.",

In the suggested model, the degradation cost of the battery storage units has been considered in the objective function as a highly influencing factor in the operation of such storage units. The framework is independent of probability density functions or membership of sets and enables the system operator to adjust the conservatism of the operating strategy (between overconservative and reckless) against the load demand uncertainty. In this respect, the SCUC model has been presented within a day-ahead scheduling problem on the hourly basis using mixed-integer linear programming. Finally, the proposed framework has been simulated on a typical 6-bus test system as well as IEEE 24-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems to verify the efficiency and the effectiveness of the model using the IGDT technique.",

        "title": "Synergistic Additives Enabling Stable Cycling of Ether Electrolyte in 4.4 V Ni‐Rich/Li Metal Batteries",
        "abstract": "Ether‐based electrolytes have high ionic conductivity and good stability toward the lithium metal anode relative to carbonate‐based electrolytes, but they typically exhibit poor oxidation stability (<4 V vs Li+/Li). Most approaches aimed at enhancing the oxidative stability of ether‐based electrolytes, such as “salt‐in‐solvent” and “weakly solvating” strategies, often sacrifice their inherent advantage of high ionic conductivity. Herein, this article proposes a cost‐effective synergistic additive strategy by co‐adding LiNO3 and vinylene carbonate (VC) to achieve an optimized ether‐based electrolyte (OEE) that simultaneously offers high Li‐ion (Li+) conductivity (11.52 mS cm−1 at 20 °C) and high‐voltage stability (4.4 V). LiNO3 and VC can enter the inner solvation shell of the electrolyte, preferentially participating in the film‐forming progress at the electrode surface, leading to the formation of a unique organic–inorganic bilayer interfacial protective layer. This layer could effectively suppress electrolyte side reactions and enhance electrode stability. As a result, the 4.4 V Li‐LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NCM811) full cells assembled with the OEE exhibit stable cycling performance at both room temperature and low temperature. This work provides a new approach to the design of ether‐based electrolytes for high‐voltage lithium metal batteries.",

        "abstract": "Silicon (Si), known for its high theoretical capacity, holds promise for developing high‐energy‐density lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs). However, the intrinsic low conductivity and substantial volume expansion limit its commercial application. Developing a binder that can suppress the massive volume expansion while improving Si conductivity is particularly important for LIBs based on Si anode. Here, grafting natural adhesive cationic guar gum (CGG) with small molecular acrylamide (AM) is proposed and applied it to the Si‐based anode. The rigid guar gum main chain and the elastic polymerized acrylamide (pAM) side chain forms a 3D network that completely encapsulated Si nanoparticles and cross‐linked with the natural hydroxyl groups on the surface of Si particles through abundant functional groups. Numerous link anchors and robust mechanical networks facilitate lithium‐ion transport and effectively mitigated the significant stress generated by silicon during charge and discharge cycles. Based on this innovative design, the Si@CGG@pAM@SP (Super P) electrode demonstrates excellent long‐term cycle stability and rate performance. The Si@CGG@pAM@SP electrode preserves 2086 mAh g−1 discharge capacity after 100 cycles (corresponding to 91.5% capacity retention). Physical characterization and electrochemical tests confirm the rationality of the polymer binder design, serving as a valuable reference for the material design of lithium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "\n With the development of electric vehicles, the demand for lithium-ion batteries has been increasing annually. Accurately estimating the State of Health (SOH) of lithium-ion batteries is crucial for their efficient and reliable use. Most of the existing research on SOH estimation is based on parameters such as current, voltage, and temperature, which are prone to fluctuations. Estimating the SOH of lithium-ion batteries based on Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and data-driven approaches has been proven effective. In this paper, we explore a novel SOH estimation model for lithium batteries based on EIS and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Vision Transformer (VIT). The EIS data is treated as a grayscale image, eliminating the need for manual feature extraction and simultaneously capturing both local and global features in the data. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, a series of simulation experiments are conducted, comparing it with various traditional machine learning models in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Coefficient of Determination (R2). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model performs best overall in the testing dataset at three different temperatures. This confirms that the model can accurately and stably estimate the SOH of lithium-ion batteries without requiring manual feature extraction and knowledge of battery aging temperature.",

However, the practical implementation of Li faces challenges, including uncontrollable dendritic growth and a deficient solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Here a straightforward method is provided for fabricating Li composites using Al‐doped Li7La3Zr2O12 particles (Li/LLZO) with high Li‐ion conductivity achieved using a mechanical kneading process. The optimized composite, with 20% LLZO content (Li/LLZO‐20), effectively regulates the Li‐ion flux, successfully suppressing Li dendritic growth. Using a systematic investigation, it is demonstrated that incorporating LLZO particles significantly accelerates Li‐ion migration at the electrode–electrolyte interface, facilitating smooth transport through the LLZO particles. Consequently, Li‐metal battery and Li–S battery cells utilizing the Li/LLZO‐20 composite anode exhibit remarkable cycle stability compared to cells employing pure Li anodes.",

According to the structural characterization of the composite, tungsten ions were doped in the unit cells of tin dioxide rather than simply attaching to the surface. Tungsten-doped SnO2 was in situ grown on the surface of graphene sheet to form a three-dimensional conductive network that enhanced the electron transportation and lithium-ion diffusion effectively. The issues of SnO2 agglomeration and volume expansion could be also avoided because the tungsten-doped SnO2 nanoparticles were homogeneously distributed on a graphene sheet. As a result, the nanocomposite electrodes of tungsten-doped SnO2 and reduced graphene oxide exhibited an excellent long-term cycling performance. The residual capacity was still as high as 1100 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles. It still remained at 776 mA h g-1 after 2000 cycles at the current density of 1A g-1.",

Benefiting from the efficient combination of GO and Cd2GeO4 NWs, our Cd2GeO4 NW/GO/CNT composite film exhibits a capacity of 784 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles at 200 mA g−1, which is 2.7 times higher than that of Cd2GeO4 NW/CNT film (290 mA h g−1). At a higher rate of 400 mA g−1 and 1 A g−1, the Cd2GeO4 NW/GO/CNT film delivers a stable capacity of 617 and 397 mA h g−1, respectively. Even at 2.5 A g−1, it still exhibits a high rate capacity of 180 mA h g−1.

Combining Li‐ and Na‐ions within a single battery system is expected to mitigate the shortcomings of both systems while leveraging their respective advantages. In this study, we developed and assembled a nanodiamonds (NDs)‐assisted co‐Li/Na‐ion battery (ND–LSIB). This innovative battery system comprised a commercial graphite anode, an ND‐modified polypropylene (DPP) separator, a hybrid lithium/sodium‐based electrolyte, and a cathode. It is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that the ND/Li co‐insertion can serve as an ion‐drill opening graphite layers and reconstructing graphite anodes into few‐layered graphene with expanding interlayer space, achieving highly efficient Li/Na storage and the theoretical maximum of LiC6 for Li storage in graphite. In addition, ND is helpful for creating a LiF‐/NaF‐rich hybrid solid electrolyte interface with improved ionic mobility, mechanical strength, and reversibility. Consequently, ND–LSIBs have higher specific capacities ~1.4 times the theoretical value of LIBs and show long‐term cycling stability.

The composite cathode consists of LiFePO4 as the active material, Super P and KS-4 carbon materials as the conductive agents, and LiTFSI as the lithium salt. An LiFePO4/LATP-PVDF-HFP/Li all-solid-state LIB was assembled using Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP)/ poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP) as the solid-state electrolyte and lithium metal as the anode. The structure of the synthesized LATP was analyzed using X-ray diffraction, and the microstructure of the composite cathode and solid electrolyte layer was observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope. The electrochemical properties of the all-solid-state LIB were analyzed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and a charge–discharge test. The effect of the composition ratio of the fabricated cathode on SSLIB performance is discussed. The results reveal that the SSLIB fabricated using the cathode containing LiFePO4, Super P, KS-4, PVDF, and LiTFSI at a weight ratio of 70:10:10:7:3 (wt.%) and a LATP/PVDF-HFP solid electrolyte layer containing PVDF-HFP, LiTFSI, and LATP at a weight ratio of 22:33:45 (wt.%) exhibited the optimal performance. Particularly, the SSLIB fabricated using the cathode containing 3% LiTFSI exhibited a discharge capacity of 168.9 mAhg−1 at 0.1 C, which is close to the theoretical capacity (170 mAhg−1), and had very good stability. The findings of this study suggests that the incorporation of an appropriate amount of LiTFSI can significantly enhance the electrochemical performance of SSLIB batteries.",

Recent research has shown that LiBs can be improved by using extremely tiny materials with special properties, called nanomaterials. When they are used in LiBs, nanomaterials can increase the amount of energy that can be stored and decrease the amount of time it takes to recharge. Nanomaterials can also extend the life of LiBs. In this article, we will explain how LiBs work and how nanomaterials might be used to improve their performance.",

        "abstract": "We develop zirconium-templated NiO/NiOOH nanosheets on nickel foam and polypyrrole-embedded in exfoliated carbon fiber cloth as complementary electrodes for an asymmetric battery-type supercapacitor device. We achieve high volumetric energy and power density by the modification of commercially available current collectors (CCs). The modified CCs provide the source of active material, actively participate in the charge storage process, provide a larger surface area for active material loading, need no additional binders or conductive additives, and retain the ability to act as the CC. Nickel foam (NF) CCs are modified by use of a soft-templating/solvothermal treatment to generate NiO/NiOOH nanosheets, where the NF is the source of Ni for the synthesis. Carbon-fiber cloth (CFC) CCs are modified by an electrochemical oxidation/reduction process to generate exfoliated core-shell structures (ECFC). Electropolymerization of pyrrole into the shell structure produces polypyrrole embedded in exfoliated core-shell material (PPy@rECFC). Battery-type supercapacitor devices are produced with NiO/NiOOH@NF and PPy@rECFC as positive and negative electrodes, respectively, to demonstrate the utility of this approach. Volumetric energy densities for the full-cell device are in the range of 2.60-4.12 mWh cm-3 with corresponding power densities in the range of 9.17-425.58 mW cm-3. This is comparable to thin-film lithium-ion batteries (0.3-10 mWh cm-3) and better than some commercial supercapacitors (<1 mWh cm-3).1 The energy and power density is impressive considering that it was calculated using the entire cell volume (active materials, separator, and both CCs). The full-cell device is highly stable, retaining 96% and 88% of capacity after 2000 and 5000 cycles, respectively. These results demonstrate the utility of directly modifying the CCs and suggest a new method to produce high volumetric energy density and power density storage devices.",

        "abstract": "\n Over the past decade, there has been a significant acceleration in the adoption of lithium-ion (li-ion) batteries for various applications, ranging from portable electronics to automotive, defense, and aerospace applications. Lithium-ion batteries are the most used energy storage technologies due to their high energy densities and capacities. However, this battery technology is a potential safety hazard under off-nominal conditions, which may result in thermal runaway events. Such events can release toxic gaseous and particulate emissions, posing a severe risk to human health and the environment. Particulate emissions from the failure of two different cell chemistries – lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) were studied. Experiments were conducted at multiple states of charge (SOC), and three repeats were conducted at each SOC for each cell chemistry to examine the repeatability/variability of these events. Particulate emissions were characterized in terms of particulate matter mass (PM2.5), black carbon, and particle number (PN)/size. Failure of a single cell led to a significant release of particulate emissions, with peak emission levels being higher at the higher SOCs. A high level of variability was observed for a specific SOC for LFP cells, while NMCs exhibited relatively less variability. In general, much higher particulate emissions were observed for NMCs compared to LFPs at each SOC. For NMCs at 100% SOC, peak PN levels were ∼2.5E+09 particles/cc (part/cc), and black carbon levels were ∼60 mg/m3. For LFPs at 100% SOC, peak PN levels were ∼9.0E+08 part/cc, and black carbon levels were 2.5 mg/m3.",

        "title": "Boosting the lithium-ion and sodium-ion storage performances of pyrite by regulating the energy barrier of ion transport.",
        "abstract": "Pyrite (FeS2) is a functional material of great importance for lithium/sodium ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs), but its sluggish dynamics greatly hinder its high performance. Here, we demonstrate an effective strategy of regulating the energy barrier of ion transport to significantly enhance the sluggish dynamics of FeS2 by Co doping. Compared to pristine FeS2, a series of Co-doped FeS2 shows enhanced alkali metal ion storage performance and most typically, the optimized Fe0.7Co0.3S2 sample displays high reversible capacities, of 1170 mA h g-1 for LIBs and 650 mA h g-1 for SIBs at a current density of 0.1 A g-1 as well as super long-life cycling stability for SIBs (1200 cycles at 5 A g-1). The evidently enhanced performances of Fe0.7Co0.3S2 for LIBs/SIBs can be attributed to its significantly decreased activation energy of ion transport, thus leading to greatly accelerated ion transport dynamics. Furthermore, galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) experiments also support this important regulation effect of Co doping on the ion transport dynamics of FeS2. The excellent ion transport dynamics induce a strong pseudo-capacitance behavior in both SIBs and LIBs, and their pseudo-capacitance contributions are more than 90% at 1.0 mV s-1. This work provides a new perspective to improve the alkali metal ion storage performance by optimizing the ion transport dynamics.",

        "abstract": "To achieve a broader public acceptance for electric vehicles based on lithium-ion battery (LIB) technology, long driving ranges, low cost, and high safety are needed. A promising pathway to address these key parameters lies in the further improvement of Ni-rich cathode materials for LIB cells. Despite the higher achieved capacities and thus energy densities, there are major drawbacks in terms of capacity retention and thermal stability (of the charged cathode) which are crucial for customer acceptance and can be mitigated by protecting cathode particles. We studied the impact of surface modifications on cycle life and thermal stability of LiNi0.90Co0.05Mn0.05O2 layered oxide cathodes with WO3 by a simple sol–gel coating process. Several advanced analytical techniques such as low-energy ion scattering, differential scanning calorimetry, and high-temperature synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction of delithiated cathode materials, as well as charge/discharge cycling give significant insights into the impact of surface coverage of the coatings on mitigating degradation mechanisms. The results show that successful surface modifications of WO3 with a surface coverage of only 20% can prolong the cycle life of an LIB cell and play a crucial role in improving the thermal stability and, hence, the safety of LIBs.",

        "abstract": "Significance It is possible to nearly double the energy density of existing lithium-ion batteries by using lithium metal anodes. However, it has been known for decades that the lithium dendrites and mossy lithium formed during charging (electrodeposition) limit the cycle life of the batteries. It is important to change the growth behavior of lithium metal, which is closely related to the properties of the solid–electrolyte interface (SEI) formed via spontaneous reactions between the lithium metal and the electrolyte. In this experimental-modeling integrated study, we reveal the design principles of the SEI that facilitates the dendrite-free and dense deposition of lithium and demonstrate one of the best cycling performances of lithium metal anode to date under practically relevant conditions. The path toward Li-ion batteries with higher energy densities will likely involve use of thin lithium (Li)-metal anode (<50 µm thickness), whose cyclability today remains limited by dendrite formation and low coulombic efficiency (CE). Previous studies have shown that the solid–electrolyte interface (SEI) of the Li metal plays a crucial role in Li-electrodeposition and -stripping behavior. However, design rules for optimal SEIs are not well established. Here, using integrated experimental and modeling studies on a series of structurally similar SEI-modifying model compounds, we reveal the relationship between SEI compositions, Li deposition morphology, and CE and identify two key descriptors for the fraction of ionic compounds and compactness, leading to high-performance SEIs. We further demonstrate one of the longest cycle lives to date (350 cycles for 80% capacity retention) for a high specific-energy Li||LiCoO2 full cell (projected >350 watt hours [Wh]/kg) at practical current densities. Our results provide guidance for rational design of the SEI to further improve Li-metal anodes.",

        "abstract": "Flexible and portable devices are a mainstream direction in modern electronics and related multidisciplinary fields. To this end, they are generally required to be stretchable to satisfy various substrates. As a result, stretchable devices, such as electrochemical supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, organic solar cells, organic light-emitting diodes, field-effect transistors, and artificial skin sensors have been widely studied. However, these stretchable devices are made in a conventional planar format that has largely hindered their development. For the portable applications, the devices need to be lightweight and small, though it is difficult for them to be made into efficient microdevices. In particular, it is challenging or even impossible for them to be used in electronic circuits and textiles that are urgently required also in a wide variety of other fields, such as microelectronic applications. Recently, some attempts have been made to fabricate wire-shaped microdevices, such as electrochemical supercapacitors. They have been generally produced by twisting two fiber electrodes with electrolytes coated on the surface. Several examples have been also successfully shown to make fiber-shaped supercapacitors with a coaxial structure. Compared with their planar counterparts, the wire or fiber shape enables promising advantages such as being lightweight and woven into textiles. Although the wire and fiber-shaped supercapacitors are also flexible with high electrochemical performance, they are not stretchable, which is critically important for many applications. For instance, the resulting electronic textiles could easily break during the use if they were not stretchable. To the best of our knowledge, herein we have, for the first time, developed a novel family of highly stretchable, fibershaped high-performance supercapacitors. Aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) sheets that are sequentially wrapped on an elastic fiber serve as two electrodes. The use of aligned CNT sheets offers combined remarkable properties including high flexibility, tensile strength, electrical conductivity, and mechanical and thermal stability. As a result, the fibershaped supercapacitor maintains a high specific capacitance of approximately 18 F/g after stretch by 75% for 100 cycles. Spinnable CNT arrays were first synthesized by chemical vapor deposition. A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the array with height of 230 mm is shown in the Supporting Information, Figure S1, and the CNT shows a multi-walled structure with diameter of about 10 nm (Supporting Information, Figure S2). Aligned CNT sheets could be then continuously drawn from the array and easily attached to various substrates. Elastic fibers were used herein to offer the stretchability in the resulting supercapactiors, and rubber fibers have been mainly studied as a demonstration. For a typical fabrication on the fiber-shaped supercapacitor (Figure 1), a rubber fiber was first coated with a thin layer of",

Various anode nanoparticles are created mainly via templating surface confinement, or encapsulation within precursors (such as metal-organic frameworks). Herein, low-content SnO2 nanodots on N-doped reduced graphene oxide (SnO2@N-rGO) were prepared as anode nanomaterials for LIBs and SIBs, via a distinctive lattice confinement of a CoAlSn-layered double hydroxide (CoAlSn-LDH) precursor. The SnO2@N-rGO composite exhibits the advantagous features of low-content (17.9 wt%) and uniform SnO2 nanodots (3.0 ± 0.5 nm) resulting from the lattice confinement of the Co and Al species to the surrounded Sn within the same crystalline layer, and high-content conductive rGO. The SnO2@N-rGO composite delivers a highly reversible capacity of 1146.2 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 for LIBs, and 387 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 for SIBs, outperforming N-rGO. Furthermore, the dominant capacitive contribution and the rapid electronic and ionic transfer, as well as small volume variation, all give rise to the enhancement. Precursor-based lattice confinement could thus be an effective strategy for designing and preparing uniform nanodots as anode nanomaterials for electrochemical energy storage.",

Nevertheless, the practical application of LSBs still faces several hazards, including the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides, low electrical conductivities of solid sulfur and lithium sulfides, and large volume expansion during charge/discharge cycles. To address this critical challenge, we innovatively proposed facile synthesis of nanostructured VN quantum dots (VNQD)/holey graphene matrix for stabilizing the sulfur cathode by simultaneously promoting the trapping, anchoring, and catalyzing efficiencies of both LiPSs and Li2S. Benefiting from abundant edge catalytic sites of VNQD, in-plane nanopores of graphene, and high electrical conductivity, the sulfur host not only provides high adsorption capability toward soluble polysulfides, strong binding ability for anchoring solid Li2S, and their rapid conversion kinetics but also contributes abundant sulfur storage sites and efficient transport pathways for lithium ions (Li+) and electrons. Consequently, the sulfur cathode exhibits high initial capacities of 1320 mAh g-1, high rate capability (850 mAh g-1 @ 4 mA cm-2), and high capacity retention of 99.95% per cycle after 500 cycles, providing a feasible solution for the practical utilization of shuttle-free Li-S batteries.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Systematic and systemic research and development of solid electrolytes for lithium batteries requires a reliable and reproducible benchmark cell system. Therefore, factors relevant for performance, such as temperature, voltage operation range, or specific current, should be defined and reported. However, performance can also be sensitive to apparently inconspicuous and overlooked factors, such as area oversizing of the lithium electrode and the solid electrolyte membrane (relative to the cathode area). In this study, area oversizing is found to diminish polarization and improves the performance in LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC622)||Li cells, with a more pronounced effect under kinetically harsh conditions (e. g., low temperature and/or high current density). For validity reasons, the polarization behavior is also investigated in Li||Li symmetric cells. Given the mathematical conformity of the characteristic overvoltage behavior with the Sand's equation, the beneficial effect is attributed to lower depletion of Li ions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. In this regard, the highest possible effect of area oversizing on the performance is discussed, that is when the accompanied decrease in current density and overvoltage overcomes the Sand's threshold limit. This scenario entirely prevents the capacity decay attributable to Li+ depletion and is in line with the mathematically predicted values.",

        "abstract": "Maximum releasable capacity and internal resistance are often used as the health indicators (HIs) of a lithium-ion battery for degradation modeling and estimation of remaining useful life (RUL). However, the maximum releasable capacity is usually difficult to estimate in online applications due to complex operating conditions in the field. Moreover, measuring the internal resistance is too expensive to be implemented on-line. In this paper, an HI extraction and optimization framework requiring only the operating parameters of lithium-ion batteries is proposed for battery degradation modeling and RUL estimation. The framework carries out raw HI extraction, transformation, correlation analysis, and verification and evaluation to achieve HI enhancement. In particular, the Box-Cox transformation is adopted to improve the correlation between the extracted HI and the battery's actual degradation state. To estimate the battery's RUL using the enhanced HI, an optimized relevance vector-machine algorithm is utilized, which can be performed in a flexible and agile way. Experimental studies using two different industrial testing data sets illustrate the high efficiency and adaptability of the proposed framework in lithium-ion battery degradation modeling and RUL estimation.",

        "abstract": "Lithium–germanium binary compounds are promising anode materials for secondary lithium-ion batteries due to their high capacity, low operating voltage, and high electronic conductivity of lithiated Ge. For their successful application in batteries, it is essential to know the temperature stability of different Li–Ge phases and the variation of their ionic conductivity depending on the operating temperatures of the batteries. This work aims to comprehensively study the thermodynamic stability and ionic conductivity in Li–Ge binary compounds using a combination of first-principle computations and machine-learning interatomic potentials. We calculated convex hulls of the Li–Ge system at various temperatures and a temperature–composition phase diagram was obtained, delineating stability fields of each phase. Our calculations show that at temperatures higher than 590 K, LiGe undergoes a I41/a–P4/mmm transition, which leads to a change in the ionic conductivity. We show that all stable and metastable Li–Ge compounds have high ionic conductivity, but LiGe and Li7Ge12 have the lowest lithium diffusion. Trajectories of diffusion and Ge arrangements depend on lithium concentration. Based on advanced theoretical approaches, this study provides insights for the development of Li–Ge materials in lithium-ion and lithium-metal battery applications.",

        "abstract": "Advanced functional materials enable lithium-ion batteries to reach high specific capacity. To achieve this goal, nickel foam (NF), as current collector, is chosen to in situ form aligned nanoarrays composed of CoP3 /carbon polyhedron (CP)/CoO. The CoO nanowire acts as bridge to link NF and CoP3 /CP which not only reinforces the adhesion between active material and NF but also enhances the capacity of whole electrode. Besides, CoP3 is evenly coupled with CP, which can effectively buffer the volume expansion of CoP3 during the charge/discharge process. Moreover, the novel architecture of CoP3 /CP/CoO/NF is beneficial to improve the electronic conductivity. As a result, the CoP3 /CP/CoO/NF anode delivers an ultrahigh specific capacity of 1715 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 which can remain at 1150 mAh g-1 after 80 cycles, demonstrating the good durability. Thus, this work develops a facile strategy to design self-supporting electrodes for an enhanced energy storage device.",

        "abstract": "Lithium‐based all‐solid‐state batteries (ASSBs) are attracting worldwide attention as the next step in the evolution of Li‐ion batteries (LIBs). They have the potential to address safety concerns and limited energy densities, which are key challenges for LIBs. The current focus is on enhancing the electrochemical properties of ASSBs. However, a suitable economic method for fabricating them remains to be established, especially when ceramic materials are used as solid electrolytes. The powder aerosol deposition method (PAD or ADM) is a ceramic processing method that uses raw ceramic powders to fabricate dense, several micrometer thick ceramic films. The entire process takes place at room temperature and in the absence of additional binders. Therefore, PAD is used in this study to fabricate ASSBs with LiNi0.83Mn0.11Co0.06O2 (NMC) as the cathode active material and Al0.2Li6.025La3Zr1.625Ta0.375O12 (LLZO) as the solid electrolyte. The cathode is fabricated as a composite with a gradient in the electrolyte concentration. The successful fabrication is confirmed through scanning electron microscopy and energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy analysis. Electrochemical characterization shows that a PAD‐ASSB can be cycled. Furthermore, it can be shown that 145 µm thick NMC films can be fabricated by PAD. The electrochemical results are compared with the theoretical potential of PAD‐ASSBs, and methods to further improve the achieved state are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Silicon (Si) has been regarded as one of the most promising anode materials for the next generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy density because it has 10 times higher theoretical specific capacity (4200 mAh/g) than that of graphite. However, severe volume change (~300%) of Si during lithiation and delithiation hinders the practical application of Si anode. In the last decade, significant progresses have been made on the specific energy and cycle life of Si based LIBs. However, calendar-life of these batteries is still far less than 10-year target required by DOE’s electrical vehicle (EV) project.\n In the current work, the role of FEC/VC in conventional carbonate electrolytes has been investigated. It has been found that FEC/VC causes large impedance growth on both Si and graphite anodes at 55 oC. The cut-off voltage of NMC622 has been found to significantly affect its impedance. NMC622 at 4.2V shows no impedance growth at 55 °C for 8 days, while severe impedance growth is observed at 4.4V. To address the instability of both SEI and CEI at elevated temperature, a new Localized High Concentration Electrolyte (LHCE) has been developed to improve the calendar life of Si based LIBs by effectively limiting impedance growth of Si/NMC622 full cells. In addition, the cycle life of the full cell is improved. The mechanism of Si full cells with improved calendar life will also be discussed.",

        "abstract": "A comprehensive understanding of the morphology evolution of deposited lithium (Li) is a primary challenge in the commercialization of Li-metal batteries. Li-metal batteries, which contain a Li-metal anode, have a theoretical capacity that is an order of magnitude greater than that of a Li-ion battery helping to overcome their energy storage limitations. However, while Li-metal batteries have proven to have a much larger specific capacity, they are hindered by unstable deposition at the electrode-electrolyte interface and severe dendritic growth. Interfacial stability is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by many different factors, including local current densities, overpotentials, Li+ concentrations, and transport properties. Additionally, varying surface characteristics such as surface chemistries and the physical structure of the anode can affect Li deposition and could be used to design a more stable interface. Due to the nature of the anode surface, it is difficult to observe the complex physics experimentally. Thus, computational modeling is a powerful tool for understanding the deposition of Li on the anode surface. In this work we present a computational model to comprehensively study the morphology of dendrites when exposed to varying conditions. While transport properties1, electrolyte characteristics2, separator structures3, and charging protocols4 play significant roles in Li dendrite morphology and interfacial stability, this work focuses on the impact of the anode surface itself on stability. This includes patterned anode surfaces for guided lithium deposition and varying surface chemistries such as surface energy and reaction rate. We concentrate on the types of defects that are present along the anode surface including surface roughness, points of high convexity, breaks in the SEI layer, lattice defects leading to changes in surface energy and their impact on instability. We also look at guided deposition through modifications of the anode surface.\n 1. J. Tan, A. M. Tartakovsky, K. Ferris, and E. M. Ryan, J Electrochem Soc, 163, A318–A327 (2016).\n 2. J. Tan and E.

However, there are still three major challenges unsolved: (1) the controversial electrochemical window of garnet, (2) the impractically large resistance at a garnet/electrode interface and the fast lithium-dendrite growth along the grain boundaries of the garnet pellet, and (3) the fast degradation during storage. We have found that these challenges are closely related to a thick Li2CO3 layer and the Li-Al-O glass phase on the surface of garnet materials. Here we introduce a simple method to remove Li2CO3 and the protons in the garnet framework by reacting garnet with carbon at 700 °C; moreover, the amount of the Li-Al-O glass phase with a low Li-ion conductivity in the grain boundary on the garnet surface was also reduced. The surface of the carbon-treated garnet pellets is free of Li2CO3 and is wet by a metallic lithium anode, an organic electrolyte, and a solid composite cathode. The carbon post-treatment has reduced significantly the interfacial resistances to 28, 92 (at 65 °C), and 45 Ω cm2 at Li/garnet, garnet/LiFePO4, and garnet/organic-liquid interfaces, respectively.

        "abstract": "Significance Lithium (Li) metal battery (LMB) is a very promising candidate for the next-generation high-energy-density batteries. However, its practical applications have been impeded by the instability of metallic Li in the state-of-the-art carbonate electrolytes. Localized high-concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) shed light for practical use of LMBs by generating stable, robust solid electrolyte interphase on Li. Here we investigate various types of fluorinated cosolvents as diluents for LHCEs to understand the correlation between the battery performance and the solvation structure and electrode/electrolyte interfacial chemistry. It clearly reveals that the diluent surrounding the highly concentrated salt-solvating solvent clusters accelerates/decelerates anion decomposition, tunes the properties of interphases, and subsequently influences the battery performance. These results can guide further development of advanced electrolytes for LMBs. Electrolyte is very critical to the performance of the high-voltage lithium (Li) metal battery (LMB), which is one of the most attractive candidates for the next-generation high-density energy-storage systems. Electrolyte formulation and structure determine the physical properties of the electrolytes and their interfacial chemistries on the electrode surfaces. Localized high-concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) outperform state-of-the-art carbonate electrolytes in many aspects in LMBs due to their unique solvation structures. Types of fluorinated cosolvents used in LHCEs are investigated here in searching for the most suitable diluent for high-concentration electrolytes (HCEs). Nonsolvating solvents (including fluorinated ethers, fluorinated borate, and fluorinated orthoformate) added in HCEs enable the formation of LHCEs with high-concentration solvation structures. However, low-solvating fluorinated carbonate will coordinate with Li+ ions and form a second solvation shell or a pseudo-LHCE which diminishes the benefits of LHCE. In addition, it is evident that the diluent has significant influence on the electrode/electrolyte interphases (EEIs) beyond retaining the high-concentration solvation structures. Diluent molecules surrounding the high-concentration clusters could accelerate or decelerate the anion decomposition through coparticipation of diluent decomposition in the EEI formation. The varied interphase features lead to significantly different battery performance. This study points out the importance of diluents and their synergetic effects with the conductive salt and the solvating solvent in designing LHCEs. These systematic comparisons and fundamental insights into LHCEs using different types of fluorinated solvents can guide further development of advanced electrolytes for high-voltage LMBs.",

However, in recent years, despite considerable efforts in the structural and chemical engineering of active materials (anode and cathode materials), interfacial architectures between the electrode and the current collector have received relatively insufficient attention in the case of ultrafast LIB. Here, the interface architecture of a micro-patterned Al current collector with a heteroatom doped graphene interfacial layer is developed using roll pressing and dip coating processes. The cathode electrode fabricated with the resultant current collector exhibits remarkably improved ultrafast and ultra-stable cycling performances, such as outstanding ultrafast cycling capacity with superb ultrafast cycling stability compared with the bare-Al and patterned-Al current collectors. These improved ultrafast and ultra-stable performances are explained in terms of the increased electron collection/provision site with a high contact area between the electrode and the current collector for enhanced ultrafast cycling capacity, and the effective corrosion prevention of the current collector with fast charge transfer for ultrafast cycling stability.",

        "title": "Assembling Iron Oxide Nanoparticles into Aggregates by Li3PO4: A Universal Strategy Inspired by Frogspawn for Robust Li-Storage.",
        "abstract": "The poor ionic conductivity of transition metal oxides (TMOs) is a huge obstacle to their practical application as anodes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Although good performance can be harvested by constructing nanostructures, some other foundmental issues including low tap density and serious electrolyte consumption come along. Herein, inspired by frogspawn, we propose a universal strategy of using lithium salts to assemble TMO nanoparticles into large aggregates to improve their Li+ conductivity. In such a frogspawn-like structure, lithium salt networks can not only realize the rapid transmission of Li+ but also alleviate the volume change during the charging/discharging process. When Li3PO4 is applied to assemble iron oxides nanoparticles, aggregates with size over 1 μm and tap density up to 1.33 g cm-3 can be obtained, which even hasve an ionic conductivity up to 9.61 × 10-5 S cm-1. Fe3O4 was also introduced through reduction to boost electron transfer. Consequently, this carbon-free composite delivered a capacity up to 896 mA h g-1 even after 1000 cycles at 5 A g-1, which can also be maintained under high mass loading. When using lithium salts such as Li2SO4, Li2CO3, LiBO2, and LiCl, the corresponding composites also showed similar performance. This strategy is also effective for TMOs such as NiO, Co3O4, and ZnO, demonstrating the universality of this frogspawn-inspired design.",

        "title": "Design of a New Hybrid Topology of WPT System to Achieve Load-Independent Constant-Current and Constant-Voltage Output",
        "abstract": "The usage of the Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) technique for charging lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries of electric vehicles (EVs) is increasing rapidly. The Li-ion battery requires constant current (CC) followed by constant-voltage (CV) supply for efficient battery charging and to enhance its lifespan. However, it is hard to obtain CC and CV outputs due to the variation of battery resistance during charging. Moreover, a zero-phase angle (ZPA) of the input source is essential to improve the power transfer capability. Therefore, this paper proposes a new hybrid compensation topology to achieve load-independent CC and CV behavior of the WPT system along with ZPA. Two symmetrical coils have been used in the proposed WPT system as transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) coils. A comprehensive mathematical analysis for achieving CC and CV characteristics as well as for power losses is carried out. A new hybrid compensation is designed by combining Series–Series (SS) and Inductor–Capacitor–Capacitor/Series (LCC-S) compensation topologies along with two additional switches. The proposed compensation works on single resonance frequency, and it is simple, reliable, and easy to implement with only one compensation capacitor from the Rx side. Simulations are performed, and a prototype is fabricated to verify the mathematical analysis and simulation results. The overall result shows that the mathematical analysis and simulations comply with the experimental results. Full load efficiencies of 90.33% and 88.91% are achieved in the CC and CV modes, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Various nanoscale SiO2 and their composites have demonstrated superior electrochemical performance as anodes for lithium-ion batteries. However, both the battery production and real applications require the integration of nanoscale SiO2 into micrometer-sized secondary particles while preserving their excellent stability and conductivity, which remains a great challenge. In this work, a unique carbon yarn-ball structure is successfully synthesized that entangles nanoscale SiO2 together to build a micrometer-sized secondary particle. The hook-like carbon wires closely adhere to individual SiO2 nanoparticles, which constitute the basic unit of the yarn-ball structure. The entangled carbon wires create a network of electron conduction highways for SiO2 , and the yarn-ball structure provides a resilient 3D matrix that can effectively buffer the anisotropic volume changes of SiO2 during Li ion insertion/extraction. Under 0.1 A g-1 , the carbon yarn-ball-entangled SiO2 can deliver a 1297 mAh g-1 discharge capacity with a small irreversible capacity of 82 mAh g-1 . The entangled carbon yarn ball firmly maintains its structural integrity during high-rate cycling (1 A g-1 ), which gives rise to a large accessible capacity (709 mAh g-1 , 90.7% retention for 500 cycles), superior coulombic efficiency (>99.9%), and excellent structural stability.",

The strong coordination in solvated structure of electrolyte defines the Li deposition behaviour and the evolution of solid electrolyte interphase at high temperature, which is important to achieve high Li Coulombic efficiency and avoid Li dendritic growth. For high mass loading LiFePO4-Li cells, the cells at 60 °C with conventional electrolyte easily run into failures, but the cells with our electrolyte at 90 °C and 100 °C could cycle more than 120 and 50 cycles respectively.

Densely and uniaxially aligned CNTs improve the electrical conductivity and act as a structural scaffold, enhancing the electrochemical performance of the anode. A partially graphitized N-doped carbon shell, which has a rapid ion accessible pore network and abundant redox sites, was designed to expand the redox sites from the surface of the material to the whole material, including the inner part.

Furthermore, the reversible capacity decreased by only 36% after 400 cycles and showed superior rate capability to that of the same material without CNTs, indicating that the CNT acted successfully as a structural scaffold and enhanced the electrical conductivity. This study not only allowed the rational design of the ideal structure of CNT-based carbonaceous anode material, which has both a rapid ion accessible structure and fast electron-transfer path, but also shed light on a potential strategy by which to use CNTs to modify the nitrogen bonding configuration in N-doped carbon for better electrochemical performance.",

In this context we herein report the electrochemical activity versus lithium and the ionic conductivity of a diborate or pyroborate B2O5(4-) based compound, Li6CuB4O10. By combining various electrochemical techniques with in situ X-ray diffraction, we show that this material can reversibly insert/deinsert limited amounts of lithium (∼0.3 Li(+)) in a potential window ranging from 2.5 to 4.5 V vs. Li(+)/Li(0). We demonstrate, via electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), that such an electrochemical activity centered near 4.25 V vs. Li(+)/Li(0) is associated with the Cu(3+)/Cu(2+) redox couple, confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Another specificity of this compound lies in its different electrochemical behavior when cycled down to 1 V vs. Li(+)/Li(0) which leads to the extrusion of elemental copper via a conversion type reaction as deduced by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Lastly, we probe the ionic conductivity by means of AC and DC impedance measurements as a function of temperature and show that Li6CuB4O10 undergoes a reversible structural transition around 350 °C, leading to a surprisingly high ionic conductivity of ∼1.4 mS cm(-1) at 500 °C.",

Furthermore, the occurrence of nanoscale rotational twinning domains in Li2MnO3 with 120° rotation angles, stacked along the [103]m/[111]c (\"m\" and \"c\" represent the monoclinic and cubic descriptions, respectively) axis was also observed. These nanoscale rotational twining domains are responsible for the pseudo-3-fold axis and their formation is supported by the superstructure reflections in selected-area electron-diffraction (SAED) patterns. Similar patterns were reported in the literature but may have been misinterpreted without the consideration of such domains. Consistent with the TEM observation, the XRD results reveal the increasing percentage of monoclinic Li2MnO3 with increasing annealing time, associated with more oxygen vacancies. In addition, the electron beam irradiation during TEM studies may cause the nucleation of nanoscale cubic spinel Li-Mn-O crystallites on the monoclinic Li2MnO3 grains.

We demonstrate that PEGDE decoration greatly increases the Li2CO3 ratio in the SEI layer, which improves the interface stability and Li+ conductivity and hence suppresses continuous electrolyte decomposition. As a result, the structural integrity of the Si particles is maintained and capacity fading is retarded. This work reveals that surface design can effectively regulate the SEI layer composition and improve interface stability, which is a promising strategy for Si-electrode manufacture.",

        "abstract": "Accurate state estimation of Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) can enable improved hybrid and electric vehicles. A Battery Management System (BMS) can use electrochemical models in conjunction with Kalman filter approaches to estimate internal battery states from current and voltage measurements. For Kalman filters, the process noise is assumed to be Gaussian and independent across states, resulting in a diagonal covariance matrix. To the best of our knowledge, these assumptions have never been validated for battery dynamics, nor has any detailed calculation of variance of each model state been presented. This paper proposes a novel method for quantifying process noise in electrochemical battery models that can be generalized to other system applications. The method is derived analytically by mapping a \"true\" high-fidelity model to a reduced model and comparing differences in concentration states. The electrochemical model used is an enhanced Single Particle Model (eSPM), where parameters were experimentally identified for a Li-NMC cell. An investigation of process noise carried out using the proposed approach shows that the covariance matrix is not diagonal and gaussian only in first approximation (but only for the diagonal terms).",

        "abstract": "Cyclodextrins (CDs) are pyranoside-based macromolecules with a hydrophobic cavity to encapsulate small molecules. They are used as molecular vehicles, for instance in pharmaceutical drug delivery or as solubility enhancer of monomers for their polymerization in aqueous solution. In this context, it was discovered about 10 years ago that the bis(trifluoromethylsulonyl)imide (TFSI) anion forms host-guest complexes with βCD in aqueous media. This sparked interest in using the TFSI anion in lithium-based battery electrolytes open for its encapsulation by βCD as an attractive approach to increase the contribution of the cation to the total ion conductivity. By using semi-empirical quantum mechanical (SQM) methods and the conductor-like screening model for a real solvent (COSMO-RS), a randomly methylated βCD (RMβCD) is here identified as a suitable host for TFSI when using organic solvents often used in battery technology. By combining molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with different NMR and FTIR experiments, the formation of the corresponding RMβCD-TFSI complex was investigated. Finally, the effects of the addition RMβCD to a set of electrolytes on the ion conductivity are measured and explained using three distinct scenarios.",

        "abstract": "The lithium-rich manganese-based layer oxide (LRMO) with high specific capacity (∼300 mAh g-1) and economic feasibility is accepted as the cathode material for high energy density rechargeable batteries. Accompanied by the additional anionic redox reactions during the initial charging process, LRMO presents oxygen release, sluggish Li+ diffusion, and irreversible transition metal ion (TM) migration, which is responsible for its severe structural deterioration and rapid capacity/voltage decay. Here, the N doping strategy is proposed via feasible treatment of oxygen-vacancy-containing Li1.16Ni0.21Mn0.63O2-δ (LNMO) particles. The as obtained LNMO-N samples demonstrate doping N, partially reduced Mn/Ni cations, and oxygen vacancies on the surface. The DFT calculations and experimental results demonstrate that N replacing the crystal oxygen sites on the surface reduces the energy barrier for diffusion, thereby enhancing the kinetics of Li+ diffusion and improving the reversibility of transition metal migration. Furthermore, N doping induces stacking faults and a more flexible structure. Therefore, LNMO-N exhibits a significantly improved anionic-cationic redox reaction reversibility with a high discharge specific capacity of 296.6 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1 within the range of 2.0 to 4.8 V and an impressive initial Coulombic efficiency of 85.9%. Moreover, the rate capability is obviously improved with a remarkable capacity of 215.1 mAh g-1 at 200 mA g-1 in 200 cycles with a capacity retention of 72.52% and exceptional performance of 141.4 mAh g-1 even at a higher current density of 1000 mA g-1.",

        "abstract": "In the world of two-dimensional (2D) materials, various Borophene allotropes have gained significant attention for their remarkable specific capacity. However, the instability of monolayers has challenged experimental investigations of innovative approaches. Due to this limitation, in this work, graphene was investigated as a sublayer with the aim of providing stability to the β12-borophene monolayer. This study delves into the potential of a novel β12-borophene/graphene (β12-B/G) van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure using Quantum Espresso software based on vdW-corrected density functional theory. Our investigation includes exploring thermal and dynamical stability, adsorption energy, open circuit voltage, specific capacity, and diffusion barrier energy properties. Impressively, the calculated specific capacity reached 907 mAh/g, outperforming other 2D materials and heterostructures. The combination of a graphene layer not only ensures dynamical stability but also provides the adsorption energy of lithiumon the β12-borophene layer, simultaneously decreasing the diffusion barrier energy in comparison with the β12-borophene monolayer. The calculated open circuit voltage falls in the range 0.08-1.09 V, rendering it suitable for an overall average commercial voltage. For the borophene layer, the computed diffusion barrier energies are approximately 0.52 and 0.78 eV. Collectively, these findings underscore the potential of theβ12-B/G heterostructure as an advanced anode material for lithium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "This study developed a physical separation process that recovers active cathode materials from current collectors in spent lithium-ion power batteries (LIBs). The physical separation process, implemented via thermal and mechanical treatments, was examined based on cohesive zone models (CZMs) and verified by physical separation experiments. The most efficient condition was determined by optimising the key parameters (temperature and time) of selective heating. Among several mechanical separation methods, high-speed shearing best separates positive electrode materials into active cathode materials (LiFePO4) and current collectors (Al fragments). The separation effect was verified by computing the dissociation rate and microscopic observation of the separated materials. The feasibility and efficiency of the above process were assessed in a work-of-force analysis, flow field simulation, high-speed crushing experiment and material property analysis. The above analyses realised a feasible, efficient and environmentally friendly separation route without changing the chemical structure and properties of the electrode materials. Under non-high (energy-conserving) temperature conditions, the LiFePO4 dissociation rate stabilises at 80–85%. Under high-speed crushing, the LiFePO4 dissociation rate reaches 85% at 32,000-r/min crushing and a maximum shearing velocity of the blade edge v ≈ 500 m/s. This approach can effectively recycle electrode materials, gain valuable resources and can be used to recycle and utilise spent LIBs, thus addressing two grave issues – environmental pollution and resource wastage to achieve the sustainable development of LIBs and electric vehicle industry.",

        "abstract": "Selenium (Se) has a high specific capacity, rendering it a promising cathode material for rechargeable lithium (Li) batteries. Yet, challenges arise due to irreversible reactions and the shuttle effect in contact with electrolytes. This study addresses these issues by confining Se within a microporous carbon derived from non-recyclable plastic waste through a two-step carbonization/activation process. The resulting plastic waste-derived carbon (PWC) serves as a host for Se, forming cathode composites through a melt diffusion process. The cathode electrode was fabricated using a slurry casting method, comprising PWC/Se composite, carbon black, and sodium alginate (8:1:1 mass ratio). The evolution of the porous structure in PWC and its impact on the electrochemical performance of PWC/Se electrode were investigated for different activation temperatures (500, 600, 700, and 800 °C). The study revealed that the structure of PWC activated below 800 °C consists of mainly micropores. Moreover, by increasing the activation temperature, the specific surface area and pore volume increased, and pore size distribution shifted towards mesoporous structure. The Li-Se coin cell made from PWC activated at 600 °C (PWC600) demonstrated superior discharge capacity (640 mAh g–1 at 0.1C after 400 cycles), rate capability, and long cycling stability at higher current densities. The microporous features of PWC600 were crucial for effective Se confinement, lithium-ion diffusion, and charge transfer. This work emphasizes the sustainable development of microporous carbon from upcycled plastic waste as a promising cathode material for high-energy Li-Se batteries. Our findings contribute to environmentally friendly energy storage solutions and the circular economy by repurposing non-recyclable plastic waste into valuable materials.",

        "title": "Superstrong Ultralong Carbon Nanotubes for Mechanical Energy Storage",
        "abstract": "Energy storage in a proper form is essential for a good grid strategy. The systems developed so far mostly use batteries or capacitors in which energy is stored electrochemically or electrostatically. Mechanical energy storage is also one of the most important ways for energy conversion. In fact, water reservoirs on high mountains store mechanical energy using the gravitational potential on the earth, and the surplus energy can be mechanically stored in water pumped to a higher elevation using pumped storage methods. Other systems for mechanical energy storage were realized, such as flstoring mechanical energies by the use of a rapidly rotating mass and steel springs storing mechanical energies by their elasticity. However, such mechanical energy storage usually is operated on a macroscopic scale, and the energy density is not very high. With the fast development of nano- and micro-electromechanical systems (N/MEMS) and actuators, nanoscale mechanical energy storage is highly required. Developing a robust nonmaterial with good mechanical performance and stable supply is the fi rst step. Ultralong carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with the properties of 1‐2 TPa modulus and 100‐200 GPa strength, [ 1‐4 ] the strongest material ever known, have shown promising potential for the storage of mechanical energy, either by their deformation in the composite materials, [ 5‐7 ] or by their elastic deformation produced by stretching or compressing the pristine tubes or tube arrays. [ 8 ] Theoretical calculation suggested that the energy storage capacity, in the latter case, can be at least three orders higher than that of steel spring and several times that of the fl ywheels and lithium ion batteries. [ 9 , 10 ] The mechanical energy storage capacity of CNTs depends on their mechanical properties, while which directly depend on their molecular structures. Besides, CNTs that simultaneously have theoretically high strength (100‐200 GPa), high tensile modulus (1‐2 TPa) and high breaking strain ( > 15%) are not yet experimentally available on the macroscale. [ 2 , 11‐20 ] This is mainly due to the existence of defects in the fabricated CNTs. Even for CNTs with little defects, the highest reported breaking strain is 13.7% ± 0.3%, [ 21 ] which is still lower than the theoretical value. [ 22 , 23 ] Here we experimentally demonstrate that the as-grown defect-free CNTs with length over 10 cm, have breaking strain up to 17.5%, tensile strength up to 200 GPa and Young’s modulus up to 1.34 TPa. They could endure a continuously repeated mechanical strain-release test for over 1.8 × 10 8 times. The extraordinary mechanical performance qualifi es them with high capacity for the storage of mechanical energy. The CNTs can store mechanical energy with a density as high as 1125 Wh kg − 1 and a power density as high as 144 MW kg − 1 , indicating the CNTs can be a promising medium for the storage of mechanical energy.",

        "abstract": "Carbon materials are widely used for reversible lithium uptake in the anode of lithium-ion batteries. Nevertheless, the challenge of uncontrollable dendrite deposition during fast charge-discharge cycles remains a grand hurdle. Various strategies have been explored to prevent detrimental heterogeneous dendrite metal deposits, such as interface engineering and electrolyte modification, but they often compromise the reverse diffusion freedom of Li+ ions during discharging and are incompatible with the most mainstream use of graphite as an anode material. Here, we propose the incorporation of a novel carbon allotrope of cyclocarbon as a potential additive in the anode. In contrast to conventional carbon materials, density functional theory calculations reveal that cyclocarbon has a much higher affinity for Li atoms than Li+ ions, even surpassing the inherent cohesion of Li atoms, due to the charge transfer from the 2s orbital of Li atoms to the unique in-plane π orbital of cyclocarbon. Furthermore, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that Li+ ions can shuttle freely back and forth across cyclocarbon, whereas the lithiation process for Li atoms occurs rapidly within picoseconds. The delithiation of Li atoms within cyclocarbon follows a voltage-gated mechanism that is effectively controlled by an external electric field of 3 V nm-1. Remarkably, cyclocarbon exhibits potential compatibility with commercialized graphite electrodes via the π-π interaction and also can be extended to sodium-ion and potassium-ion batteries. These distinct compatibility, scalability and electrochemical properties of cyclocarbon provide a new avenue to realize both safety and ultrafast rechargeable performance of ion batteries.",

However, the structure and performance degradation are exacerbated by increasing voltage due to the catastrophic reaction between the applied electrolyte and delithiated LCO. The present study focuses on the construction of physically and chemically robust Mg-integrated cathode-electrolyte interface (MCEI) to address this issue, by incorporating Magnesium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Mg[TFSI]2 ) as an electrolyte additive. During formation cycles, the strong MCEI is formed and maintained its 2 nm thickness throughout long-term cycling. Notably, Mg is detected not only in the robust MCEI, but also imbedded in the surface of the LCO lattice. As a result, the parasitic interfacial side reactions, surface phase reconstruction, particle cracking, Co dissolution and shuttling are considerably suppressed, resulting in long-term cycling stability of LCO up to 4.5 V. Therefore, benefit from the double protection of the strong MCEI, the Li||LCO coin cell and the Ah-level Graphite||LCO pouch cell exhibit high capacity retention by using Mg-electrolyte, which are 88.13% after 200 cycles and 90.4% after 300 cycles, respectively.

        "abstract": "A high-performance α-MoO3/multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) nanocomposite material is synthesized via a novel surfactant-assisted solvothermal process followed by low-temperature calcination. Its structure, composition, and morphology are characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, carbon element analysis, nitrogen adsorption-desorption determination, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy techniques. Its electrochemical performance as a high-capacity lithium-ion-battery anode material is investigated by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and galvanostatic discharge/recharge methods. This composite material exhibits not only high capacity but also excellent rate capability and cyclability. For example, when the discharge/charge current density is increased from 0.1 to 2 A g(-1), the reversible charge capacity is only decreased from 1138.3 to 941.4 mAh g(-1), giving a capacity retention of 82.7%. Even if it is cycled at a high current density of 20 A g(-1), a reversible charge capacity of 490.2 mAh g(-1) is still retained, showing a capacity retention of 43.1%. When it is repeatedly cycled at a current of 0.5 A g(-1), the initial reversible charge capacity is 1041.1 mAh g(-1). A maximum charge capacity of 1392.2 mAh g(-1) is achieved at the 292th cycle. After 300 cycles, a high charge capacity of 1350.3 mAh g(-1) is maintained. Enhancement of the electrical conduction contributed by the MWCNT composite component as well as the loose and porous texture of the MoO3/MWCNT composite is suggested to be responsible for the excellent performance.",

        "abstract": "Aluminum-based foil anodes could enable lithium-ion batteries with high energy density comparable to silicon and lithium metal. However, mechanical pulverization and lithium trapping within aluminum tend to cause capacity fading. The complex interplay between these damage modes is not well understood, as well as the role of microstructure on reaction front evolution. Here, we investigate aluminum foils with different compositions and processing conditions to understand how microstructure influences chemo-mechanical degradation. Backscattered electron imaging of ion-milled foil cross sections is used to visualize reaction front evolution and chemo-mechanical degradation. We find that the shape of the reaction front during lithiation is strongly affected by foil composition, defect distribution, and grain size, which, in turn, affects the evolution of chemo-mechanical damage within the foils. Furthermore, a key finding is that the extent of fracture upon delithiation is inversely related to lithium trapping, with foil compositions that exhibit uniform lithiation, and therefore, less fracturing showing greater lithium trapping. Nonreactive precipitate inclusions within alloy foils are also found to induce void formation. This work shows that material design strategies designed to overcome the inverse fracture-lithium trapping relationship could be useful for improving performance.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2024\n \n \n",

        "title": "Weak Solvation Effect Enhancing Capacity and Rate Performance of Vanadium‐Based Calcium Ion Batteries: A Strategy Guided by Donor Number",
        "abstract": "Calcium ion batteries (CIBs) are considered as an important candidate for post‐lithium energy storage devices due to their abundance of resources and low cost. However, CIBs still suffer from slow kinetics due to the large solvation structure and high desolvation energy of Ca2+ ions. Here, a solvation regulation strategy based on donor number (DN) is reported to achieve easy‐desolvation and rapid storage of Ca2+ in sodium vanadate (Na2V6O16·2H2O, NVO). Specially, the solvent with a low DN, represented by propylene carbonate (PC), forms the first solvation shell of calcium ions with weak binding energy and small shell structure, which facilitates the migration of Ca2+ in the electrolyte. More importantly, the low DN solvent is preferentially desolvated at the cathode/electrolyte interface, promoting the insertion of Ca2+ into the NVO electrode. Mechanism studies further confirm the highly reversible uptake/release of Ca2+ in the NVO cathode, along with the VO distance change in the coordination structure. Therefore, the NVO cathode achieves high capacity (376 mAh g−1 at 0.3 A g−1) and high‐rate performance (151 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1). The weak solvation effect strategy further improves the electrochemical performance and provides great importance for the design of the long‐term development of CIBs.",

        "abstract": "Nanostructured TiO2 of different polymorphs, mostly prepared by hydro/solvothermal methods, have been extensively studied for more than a decade as anode materials in lithium ion batteries. Enormous efforts have been devoted to improving the electrical conductivity and lithium ion diffusivity in chemically synthesized TiO2 nanostructures. In this work we demonstrate that 3D Ti3+-self-doped TiO2 (TiO2-δ) nanomembranes, which are prepared by physical vapor deposition combined with strain-released rolled-up technology, have a great potential to address several of the long-standing challenges associated with TiO2 anodes. The intrinsic electrical conductivity of the TiO2 layer can be significantly improved by the in situ generated Ti3+, and the amorphous, thin TiO2 nanomembrane provides a shortened Li+ diffusion pathway. The fabricated material shows a favorable electrochemical reaction mechanism for lithium storage. Further, post-treatments are employed to adjust the Ti3+ concentration and crystallinity degree in TiO2 nanomembranes, providing an opportunity to investigate the important influences of Ti3+ self-doping and amorphous structures on the electrochemical processes. With these experiments, the pseudocapacitance contributions in TiO2 nanomembranes with different crystallinity degree are quantified and verified by an in-depth kinetics analysis. Additionally, an ultrathin metallic Ti layer can be included, which further improves the lithium storage properties of the TiO2, giving rise to the state-of-the-art capacity (200 mAh g-1 at 1 C), excellent rate capability (up to 50 C), and ultralong lifetime (for 5000 cycles at 10 C, with an extraordinary retention of 100%) of TiO2 anodes.",

        "title": "Why Lithium Ions Stick to Some Anions and Not Others.",
        "abstract": "Designing battery electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries has been a topic of extensive research for decades. The ideal electrolyte must have a large conductivity as well as high Li+ transference number. The conductivity is very sensitive to the nature of the anions and dynamical correlations between ions. For example, lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) has a large conductivity, but the chemically similar lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiOTf) shows poor conductivity. In this work, we study the binding of Li+ to these anions in an ethylene carbonate (EC) solvent using enhanced sampling metadynamics. The evaluated free energies display a large dissociation barrier for LiOTf compared to LiTFSI, suggesting long-lived ion-pair formation in the former but not the latter. We probe these observations via unbiased molecular dynamics simulations and metadynamics simulations of TFSI with a hypothetical OTF-like partial charge model indicating an electrostatic origin for those differences. Our results highlight the deleterious impact of sulfonate groups in lithium-ion battery electrolytes and provide a new basis for the assessment of electrolyte designs.",

        "abstract": "Aqueous zinc-based batteries are a very promising technology in the post-lithium era. However, excess zinc metals are often used, which results in not only making a waste but also lowering the actual energy density. Herein, a Ti3C2Tx/nanocellulose (derived from soybean stalks) hybrid film is prepared by a facile solution casting method and employed as the zinc-free anode for aqueous hybrid Zn-Li batteries. Benefiting from the ultra-low diameter and rich hydroxyl groups of nanocellulose, the hybrid film exhibits better mechanical properties, superior electrolyte wettability, and more importantly, significantly improved zinc plating/stripping reversibility compared to the pure Ti3C2Tx film. The hybrid film also dramatically overwhelms the stainless steel as the electrode for reversible zinc deposition. Further analysis shows that the hybrid film can lower the zinc deposition overpotential and promote the desolvation process of hydrated Zn2+ ions. In addition, it is found that hexagonal Zn thin flakes are horizontally deposited onto the hybrid film owing to the low lattice mismatch between the Ti3C2Tx surface and the (002) facet of Zn. Consequently, zinc dendritic growth and accompanied harmful side reactions can be considerably inhibited by the hybrid film, and the assembled Zn-Li hybrid batteries exhibit excellent electrochemical performances. This work might inspire future work on zinc-based batteries.",

        "abstract": "The lithium (Li) dendrite growth seriously hinders the applications of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Numerous methods have been proposed to restrict the formation of Li dendrites by improving the Li‐ion transference number (tLi+) through separator modification according to Sand's time equation. However, ignoring the positive contribution of anion motion to solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation will result in insufficient inorganic components, which impedes practical implementation of LMBs. Herein, a “tandem” separator is constructed (ZSM‐5‐Poly dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride (PDDA)/Polyethylene (PE)/SbF3), which anchored anions and built an inorganic‐rich SEI at the same time. The resulting SEI from SbF3 (SBF) coating on side facing Li is rich in Li‐Sb alloy (Li3Sb) and LiF. Li3Sb can significantly reduce the migration energy barrier of Li ion (Li+) and facilitate Li+ transport. Simultaneously, ZSM‐5‐PDDA (Z5P) coating at the other side can effectively immobilize anions and increase the tLi+. Moreover, the regular pore structure is conducive to homogenizing Li+ flux and also capable to uniform temperature distribution, significantly improving safety. Hence, the lifespan of Li|Li and Li|Cu cells assemble with Z5P/PE/SBF separator is significantly extended. In addition, full cells with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) and LiFePO4 (LFP) cathodes show excellent cycle stability and superior rate performance.",

The procured TiO2-x@C membrane facilitates the infiltration of electrolyte, provides fast lithium-ion and electron transport channels and abundant sulfur loading sites, and shows superb structural buffering against the large volume changes during the conversion process between sulfur and lithium sulfide. More importantly, the introduction of oxygen vacancies not only enhances the conductivity of the original TiO2, but it also improves the corresponding adsorption abilities toward polysulfides and the subsequent transformation dynamics.

        "abstract": "From portable electronics to electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries have been deeply integrated into our daily life and industrial fields for a few decades. The booming field of battery manufacturing could lead to shortages in resources and massive accumulation of battery waste, hindering sustainable development. Therefore, hydrometallurgy-based approaches have been widely used in industrial recycling to recover cathode materials due to their high efficiency and throughput. Impurities have always been a great challenge for hydrometallurgical recycling, introducing challenges to maintain the consistency of product quality because of potential unintended effects caused by impurities. Herein, after comprehensive investigation, we first report the impacts of phosphate impurity on a recycled LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (\"NCM622\") cathode via a hydrometallurgy method. We demonstrate that a passivation layer of Li3PO4 is formed at grain boundaries during sintering, which significantly raises the activation barrier and hinders lithium diffusion. In addition, the distinct degradation of cathode electrochemical properties is observed from poor particle morphology and high cation mixing as a result of phosphate impurity. Cathode powders with 1 at. % phosphate impurity retain a capacity of 146 mAh/g after 100 cycles at 0.33C, 6% less than that of a virgin cathode. Furthermore, cathodes with higher phosphate concentrations perform even worse in electrochemical tests. Therefore, phosphate impurities are detrimental to the hydrometallurgical recycling of NCM cathode materials and need to be excluded from the recycling process.",

Traditional segmentation methods often struggle to accurately capture the complex microstructures of porous LIB electrodes in focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) data. In this work, we develop a deep learning model based on the Swin Transformer to segment FIB-SEM data of a lithium cobalt oxide electrode, utilizing fused secondary and backscattered electron images. The proposed approach outperforms other deep learning methods, enabling the acquirement of 3D microstructure with reduced particle elongated artifacts. Analyses of the segmented microstructures reveal improved electrode tortuosity and pore connectivity crucial for ion and electron transport, emphasizing the necessity of accurate 3D modeling for reliable battery performance predictions. These results suggest a path toward voxel-level degradation analysis through more sensible battery simulation on high-fidelity microstructure models directly twinned from real porous electrodes.",

The close contact between the N-TiO2 and the graphene suppresses the growth and aggregation of TiO2 nanoparticles during heating process, leading to decreased Li+ diffusion length. The N-doping in both TiO2 and the graphene matrix could improve the electronic conductivity on the TiO2 particle surface and between adjacent particles. As expected, when used as an anode for Li-ion batteries (LIBs), the N-TiO2 /N-3D GFs composite delivers an excellent reversible capacity of 165 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at 100 mA g-1 and an outstanding rate capability of 114 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles at 1 Ag-1 .

But the huge interfacial resistance, Li dendrite growth, and low critical current density (CCD) block the practical applications. Herein, a superlithiophilic 3D burr‐microsphere (BM) interface layer composed of ionic conductor LiF‐LaF3 is constructed in situ to achieve a high‐rate and ultra‐stable solid‐state lithium metal battery. The 3D‐BM interface layer with a large specific surface area shows a superlithiophilicity and its contact angle with molten Li is only 7° enabling the facile infiltration of molten Li. The assembled symmetrical cell reaches one of the highest CCD (2.7 mA cm−2) at room temperature, an ultra‐low interface impedance of 3 Ω cm2, and a super‐long cycling stability of 12 000 h at 0.1–1.5 mA cm−2 without Li dendrite growth. The solid‐state full cells with 3D‐BM interface show outstanding cycling stability (LiFePO4: 85.4%@900 cycles@1 C; LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2:89%@200 cycles@0.5 C) and a high rate capacity (LiFePO4:135.5mAh g−1 at 2 C). Moreover, the designed 3D‐BM interface is quite stable after 90 days of storage in the air.

        "abstract": "The morphological design of graphene materials is definitely important since their electrochemical properties as an electrode in energy storage devices are mainly dominated by their charge accessibility and active area. In this work, we present a systematic investigation on the prospects of a pristine graphene aerogel and a pristine graphene xerogel as electrode materials for both supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries. We confirm that the graphene aerogel has a significantly higher surface area, needed for effective charge storage, than the xerogel, which offers a clear advantage for supercapacitors. In terms of battery performance, the quality of the pristine graphene raw materials is a more critical factor than their shape owing to the lithium intercalation mechanism. As a result, the graphene aerogel supercapacitors exhibited a specific capacitance of about 700 F g-1 at 10 mV s-1 in 1 M LiPF6 electrolyte, which is 3.6 times higher than the values for the xerogel devices. On the other hand, the electrochemical battery performances of the graphene aerogel and xerogel show no significant difference considering their high specific capacity of about 380 mA h g-1 at 1C. Further, the surface control kinetics of the graphene aerogel are much more dominant in the supercapacitor and battery applications than those of the xerogel. This study provides more practical approaches in order to design electrodes using lightweight, high-performance, and low-cost materials for the effective use of energy storage systems.",

Experimentally, weakly interacting anionic groups have the best conductivity. To provide a theoretical basis for this result, density functional theory calculations of the optimized geometries and energies are performed for charged ligands used in SIPE. Comparison is made to neutral ligands found in dual-ion conductors, which demonstrate higher conductivity. The free energy differences between adding and subtracting a ligand are small enough for the neutral ligands to have the conductivity seen experimentally. However, charged ligands have large barriers, implying that lithium transport will coincide with the slow polymer diffusion, as observed in experiments. Overall, SIPE will require additional solvent to achieve a sufficiently high conductivity. Additionally, the binding of mono- and bidentate geometries varies, providing a simple and clear reason that polarizable force fields are required for detailed interactions.",

        "abstract": "Silicon has been considered a good candidate for replacing the commonly used carbon anodes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), due to its high specific capacity which can be up to 11 times higher than that of carbon. However, the desirable advantage that silicon brings to battery performance is currently overshadowed by its stress-induced performance loss and high electronic resistivity. The induced stress arises from two sources, namely; the deposition process (i.e. residual-stress) during fabrication and the volume expansion (i.e. mechanical-stress) associated with the lithiation/delithiation process. Of the two, residual-stress has largely been ignored, underestimated, or considered to have a negligible effect without any rigorous evidence being put forward. In this contribution, we produced silicon thin-films having a wide range of residual-stress and resistivity using a physical vapor deposition technique, magnetron sputtering. Three pairs of silicon thin-film anodes were utilized to study the effect of residual-stress on the electrochemical and cyclability performance as anodes for LIBs. Each set consisted of a pair of films having essentially the same resistivity, density, thickness, and oxidation amount, but distinctly different residual-stress. The comparison was evaluated by conducting charge/discharge cycling and cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments. In contrast to the fixed belief within the literature, higher compressive residual-stress films showed better electrochemical and cycle performance compared to lower residual stress films. The results herein present an informed understanding of the role that residual-stress plays which will help researchers improve the development of silicon-based thin-film anodes.",

        "abstract": "Doping and carbon encapsulation modifications have been proven to be effective methods for enhancing the lithium storage performance of batteries. The hydrothermal method and ball milling are commonly used methods for material synthesis. In this study, a composite anode material rich in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) conductive tubular network connection and encapsulation of SnO2-MoS2@CNTs (SMC) was synthesized by combining these two methods. In this highly conductive network, nano-SnO2 particles are uniformly dispersed and embedded in MoS2 with a layered structure, and the obtained SnO2-MoS2 composite material is tightly connected and encapsulated by the tubular network of CNTs. It is worth noting that the incorporation of layered MoS2 not only effectively anchors the SnO2 nanoparticles, but also provides a broader space for lithium-ion movement due to the larger interlayer spacing. The conductive network of CNTs shortens the diffusion path of electrons and Li+ and provides more diffusion channels. The reversible capacity of the SnO2-MoS2@CNTs nanocomposite material remains at 1069.3 mA h g-1 after 320 cycles at 0.2 A g-1, and it exhibits excellent long-term cycling stability, maintaining 904.5 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1. The composite material demonstrates excellent pseudocapacitive contribution rate performance, with a contribution rate of 87% at 2.0 mV s-1. The results indicate that SnO2-MoS2@CNTs has excellent electrochemical lithium storage performance and is a promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries.",

We report herein the electrochemical performance of dynamically stretchable pseudocapacitors using buckled MnO2/CNT hybrid electrodes. The extremely small relaxation time constant of less than 0.15 s indicates a fast redox reaction at the MnO2/CNT hybrid electrodes, securing a stable electrochemical performance for the dynamically stretchable pseudocapacitors. This finding and the fundamental understanding gained from the pseudo-capacitive behavior coupled with mechanical deformation under a dynamic stretching mode would provide guidance to further improve their overall performance including a higher power density than LIBs, a higher energy density than EDLCs, and a long-life cycling stability. Most importantly, these results will potentially accelerate the applications of stretchable pseudocapacitors for flexible and biomedical electronics.",

Here, by performing in situ studies on a model intercalation electrode material, anatase TiO2, we reveal that defects─both preexisting and as-formed during lithiation─can mediate the local anisotropic volume expansion direction, resulting in the formation of multiple differently oriented phase domains and eventually a network structure within the lithiated matrix. Our results indicate that such a mechanism operated by defects, if properly harnessed, could not only improve lithium transport kinetics but also facilitate strain accommodation and mitigate chemomechanical degradation. These findings provide insights into the connection of defects to the robustness and rate performance of electrodes, which help guide the development of advanced lithium-ion batteries via defect engineering.",

High-power lithium-ion batteries require electrode materials that can store lithium quickly and reversibly.

The presence of graphite enables the formation of a dominant Nb12 O29 phase and a minor T-Nb2 O5 phase. The high rate capability is attributed to the enhanced electronic conductivity and lower energy barriers for fast lithium diffusion in both Nb12 O29 and T-Nb2 O5 , as unraveled by density functional theory calculations. The excellent durability or long cycling life is originated from the coherent redox behavior of Nb ions and high reversibility of lithium intercalation/deintercalation, as revealed by operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis.

        "abstract": "Advances in technology applications are becoming more visible in everyday activities as the globe becomes more technologically skilled and evolved. Being able to receive and execute control is critical in the age of Internet of Things technology and control. This pattern eventually led to the development of an Internet of Things (IoT) system for reporting room occupancy as a promising technique or system for determining the availability of rooms and buildings. This method lowers human mistake, mismanagement, and energy use, all of which directly translate to decrease hotel running costs, possibly to zero. As a result, it is conceivable that the number of guests staying in Nigerian hotels has risen significantly. If this is the case, good management will most certainly result in an immense rise in profits. However, sharp practices among hotel employees tend to divert the profit met for the owners, thus this project is designed to automatically report hotel occupancy easily accessible to owners. An infrared detection circuit was used detect human movement and a lithium-ion battery that supplied 3.7 volts was used as the power supply for the circuit while a GPRS module (a SIM 800L GSM module) was utilized to receive and transmit data messages via radio waves, and an LGT8F328P microcontroller controlled every other component in the circuit. An android application was developed and installed on a mobile phone to gather all of the real-time readings and events that take place throughout the project’s system. The programming of the microcontroller was done using the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) software and C++ programming language. When the project was turned on, I saw that all of the LEDs turned on automatically. The first two LEDs (brown and green) were automatically turned on, as were the corresponding room LEDs. After that, the green LED turned off. When the infrared LEDs’ visibility is obscured, their input to the phototransistors in each room and the LEDs attached to each room automatically turn on, indicating that the rooms are occupied and vice versa. The various room compartments’ check-ins and check-outs are tracked, managed, and updated using the proposed hardware. The data is then transmitted to the IoT cloud and eventually to the Android application",

        "abstract": "Ceramic electrolytes hold application prospects in all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLB). However, the ionic conductivity of ceramic electrolytes is limited by their large thickness and intrinsic resistance. To cope with this challenge, a two-dimensional (2D) vermiculite film has been successfully prepared by self-assembling expanded vermiculite nanosheets. The raw vermiculite mineral is first exfoliated to thin sheets of several atomic layers with about 1.2 nm interlayer channels by a thermal expansion and ionic exchanging treatment. Then, through vacuum filtration, the ion-exchanged expanded vermiculite (IEVMT) sheets can be assembled into thin films with a controllable thickness. Benefiting from the thin thickness and naturally lamellar framework, the as-prepared IEVMT thin film exhibits excellent ionic conductivity of 0.310 S·cm−1 at 600 °C with low excitation energy. In addition, the IEVMT thin film demonstrates good mechanical and thermal stability with a low coefficient of friction of 0.51 and a low thermal conductivity of 3.9 × 10−3 W·m−1·K−1. This reveals that reducing the thickness and utilizing the framework is effective in increasing the ionic conductivity and provides a promising stable and low-cost candidate for high-performance solid electrolytes.",

        "abstract": "Lithium-sulfur batteries have been regarded as promising candidates for energy storage because of their high energy density and low cost. It is a main challenge to develop long-term cycling stability battery. Here, a catalytic strategy is presented to accelerate reversible transformation of sulfur and its discharge products in lithium-sulfur batteries. This is achieved with single-atomic iron active sites in porous nitrogen-doped carbon, prepared by polymerizing and carbonizing diphenylamine in the presence of iron phthalocyanine and a hard template. The Fe-PNC/S composite electrode exhibited a high discharge capacity (427 mAh g-1) at a 0.1 C rate after 300 cycles with the Columbic efficiency of above 95.6%. Besides, the electrode delivers much higher capacity of 557.4 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C over 300 cycles. Importantly, the Fe-PCN/S has a smaller phase nucleation overpotential of polysulfides than nitrogen-doped carbon alone for the formation of nanoscale of Li2S as revealed by ex situ SEM, which enhance lithium-ion diffusion in Li2S, and therefore a high rate performance and remarkable cycle life of Li-sulfur batteries were achieved.

        "abstract": "There are numerous “beyond lithium ion” battery chemistries under development at universities, national labs, companies, and other organizations. Early-stage battery chemistry work typically focuses on demonstrating performance at the materials, coin, and pouch cell level, with evaluation and design for safety left for later stages.1 In this talk, we will describe the opportunities for assessing the safety of a battery chemistry at the earliest stages of its development, as soon as the active materials and electrolyte have been identified.2 With carefully designed and quantitative experiments, key information such as the amounts of heat released by the reactions of and among cell components, the temperatures at which that heat is released, the release of toxic or otherwise dangerous gases, the material heat capacities, and other key properties can be measured with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and other approaches. We have demonstrated the value of this approach for a LixCoO2+C+PVDF cathode sheet /LLZO/Li metal material set, where we identified the previously under-appreciated role of the cathode sheet conductive additive and binder in the reaction pathways upon heating to 500°C in a DSC pan.3 Despite this material set containing no liquid electrolyte, delithiated LixCoO2 releases oxygen upon heating to >~230°C, and that oxygen can react exothermically with the Li metal and conductive carbon. In addition, PVDF binder releases HF gas at >400°C, which can also react exothermically with Li metal.\n This talk will focus on the methodology required to obtain accurate measurements on milligram-scale samples, with an emphasis on the sample preparation and DSC methods to obtain accurate, repeatable results. Approaches associated with DSC baselining and integration methods will be presented. The talk will also present results from our recent work on material sets that are more commercially relevant for electric vehicle applications than the LixCoO2 cathode sheet/ LLZO / Li material set. In particular, results from material sets such as NMC532 cathode sheet / LLZO / Li, NMC811 cathode sheet / LLZO / Li, and NMC811 cathode sheet / LPSCl / Li metal will be presented. Finally, we will discuss the implications of our early-stage, material-scale work for future large-format cells.\n 1.

        "abstract": "Silicon has gained significant attention as a lithium-ion battery anode material due to its high theoretical capacity compared to conventional graphite. Unfortunately, silicon anodes suffer from poor cycling performance caused by their extreme volume change during lithiation and de-lithiation. Compositing silicon particles with 2D carbon materials, such as graphene, can help mitigate this problem. However, an unaddressed challenge remains: a simple, inexpensive synthesis of Si/graphene composites. Here, a one-step laser-scribing method is proposed as a straightforward, rapid (≈3 min), scalable, and less-energy-consuming (≈5 W for a few minutes under air) process to prepare Si/laser-scribed graphene (LSG) composites. In this research, two types of Si particles, Si nanoparticles (SiNPs) and Si microparticles (SiMPs), are used. The rate performance is improved after laser scribing: SiNP/LSG retains 827.6 mAh g-1 at 2.0 A gSi+C -1 , while SiNP/GO (before laser scribing) retains only 463.8 mAh g-1 . This can be attributed to the fast ion transport within the well-exfoliated 3D graphene network formed by laser scribing. The cyclability is also improved: SiNP/LSG retains 88.3% capacity after 100 cycles at 2.0 A gSi+C -1 , while SiNP/GO retains only 57.0%. The same trend is found for SiMPs: the SiMP/LSG shows better rate and cycling performance than SiMP/GO composites.",

The presence of AEBD in a full-cell results in inhibition of structural degradation of both cathode and anode materials, suppressing crack formation, as well as in reduced metal-dissolution from the cathode and metal-deposition on the anode. As a consequence the interfacial resistance is significantly reduced. Moreover, this is the case of \"the whole is greater than the sum of the parts\": effect of AEBD in half-cells is rather modest, while in full-cells its addition results in tremendous performance improvement. The graphite‖NCM851005 full-cell in the presence of AEDB has a capacity retention of 88 % after 100 cycles, even when the upper cut-off voltage is set to 4.35 V, corresponding to 4.4 V vs Li + /Li, while with standard electrolyte at the same conditions it is only 21 %.

This work opens a low-temperature route to synthesize valuable carbides. The resultant Mo2C-C hybrid, for the first time, is used as an anode material in lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Compared with bulk Mo2C, the Mo2C-C hybrid exhibits much better electrochemical performance. Remarkably, the hybrid electrode can deliver a specific capacity of over 670 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles at 100 mA g(-1), which is much higher than that of the bulk material (113 mA h g(-1)). Even cycled at a high current density of 1000 mA g(-1), high capacities of around 400-470 mA h g(-1) can still be retained for the Mo2C-C hybrid. It might benefit from the synergistic effect of the nanohybridization, effectively relieving the volume change during the repeated lithium insertion-extraction reactions and maintaining the integrity of the electrical connections. It is expected that the present synthesis strategy for the Mo2C-C hybrid can be extended to other nanostructured carbides with good energy storage performance.",

In the current study, quasi-2D rhombohedral Bi0.775Ln0.225O1.5 (Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Eu) samples, synthesized by a solution combustion route, have been demonstrated to intercalate iodine reversibly. A solid-vapor reaction was employed to intercalate iodine at moderate temperatures, and deintercalation occurred on heating at higher temperatures. Expansion of the rhombohedral c-axis by ∼10 Å occurred, and the iodine between the interlayers existed as triiodide ions (I3-) in an unsymmetrical fashion. The amount of intercalated iodide has been determined from thermogravimetric analysis. Electron microscopic analysis confirmed these systems' intercalation and subsequent lattice expansion. In the diffuse reflectance spectra, charge transfer from the triiodide ions to the host oxide was noticed, and it caused the absorption edge to fall beyond the visible region for the intercalated samples. XPS analysis of iodine intercalated Bi0.775Pr0.225O1.5 has shown the mixed valence states for Pr and the existence of I3- along with some IO3- species. The quasi-2D structure was stable during the thermal deintercalation process. The evaluation of iodine intercalated Bi0.775Ln0.225O1.5 (Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Eu) samples as anode material in the lithium-ion battery system has given quite promising results, exhibiting fast Li+-ion diffusion, low charge transfer resistance, good reversible capacity, capacity retention (after cycling back to 10 mA g-1), and structural stability (after long cycles).",

        "title": "Operando Ambient Pressure X Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy for Li-Ion Battery Electrode/Electrolyte Interface Probing",
        "abstract": "Electrochemical reactions occur at the electrode/electrolyte interface. In lithium-ion batteries, the reversible Li ion insertion/desertion from the interfaces of electrodes gives the capacity of the battery. The surface phase transition and component chemical states change during the lithiation/delithiation in turn hugely effect the further battery capacity and reversibility. In the past decades, many ex-situ characterizations gave some insights of electrode surface behavior after cycling. However, the surface chemistry of electrode relies decisively on the real battery operation condition, e.g. the passive layer formed on the electrode surface changes dramatically with the absence of electrolyte. Therefore it is emerging and necessary to develop operando study for electrode/electrolyte interface probing during battery cycling.\n X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as a surface sensitive technique detects the photoelectrons ejected from core level with certain pass energy. The binding energy of the electrons give the information of chemical composition and chemical states of the materials. Ambient pressure XPS, developed rapidly in recent years after since it gives possibility of the participation of gas and/ liquid phase, enabling the observation of structure dynamics during chemical reactions, thereby unprecedentedly extended the application of the technique. A method called dip-and-pull is used for operando liquid/solid interface probing. With a typical three-electrode system, the electrode is pulled up from the electrolyte with still contact to liquid to maintain the circuit. A thin film of electrolyte formed with a shape of meniscus at the interface of electrode, electrolyte and atmosphere is probed through. The probing of the electrochemical active surface through the liquid can be achieved with an optimized liquid layer and surface condition.\n In this study Lithium cobalt oxide (LCO), as the most widely used positive electrode for Li-ion battery with rock salt layered structure optimized for reversible Li intercalation/deintercalation, is used for interface dynamics investigation. As Li is deintercalated from LCO structure, the charge transfer from Li+ to Co-O environment causes a phase change. It was commonly assumed that the charge due to the deintercalation of Li from structure is fully transferred to Co3+, i.e. the loss of one electron contributes to one Co4+ from Co3+ oxidation. However, it is recently reported that the real condition maybe more complicated. The charge transfer from Li+ to Oa- (a<2) might take place especially during high voltage due to the hybrid fermi level of O and Co which might increase the mobility of Oa- and further results in cobalt reduction and oxygen evolution reaction. But the mechanism of structure evolution under corresponding potentials are very unclear. In this study, with the operando probing with APXPS, it is discovered that a native phase of Co2+ may play an unignorable role in the charge transfer, giving some new understandings of phase transition during lithiation/delithiation (see figure 1).

        "title": "New insights into the modification mechanism of Li-rich Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2 coated by Li2ZrO3.",
        "abstract": "Lithium-rich Mn-based layered cathode materials have attracted wide attention due to their high specific capacity for lithium-ion batteries. However, some critical issues i.e. poor rate capability and voltage fade have limited their practical applications. Herein, we propose a synchronous lithiation strategy to coat Li-rich Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2 (LMNO) with a thin layer of Li(+)-conductive Li2ZrO3. The obtained syn-Li2ZrO3@LMNO integrates the advantages of the Li2ZrO3 coating and Zr(4+) doping, and shows a much higher rate capability and cycling stability than those of the counterpart post-Li2ZrO3@LMNO fabricated by a post-coating method. More importantly, the average voltage of syn-Li2ZrO3@LMNO has been enhanced by 0.15 V and the voltage decay has also been mitigated. New insights into the synergetic modification mechanism of the Li2ZrO3 coating and Zr(4+) doping have been proposed. The coating layer of Li(+)-conductive Li2ZrO3 alleviates the surface side reactions, suppresses the transition metal dissolution and enhances the Li-ion conductivity. Meanwhile, the doping and incorporation of Zr(4+) into the host structure accompanied by the Li2ZrO3 coating expands the interplanar spacing and decreases Li/Ni mixing which facilitates Li(+) diffusion. In addition, the integration of the Li2ZrO3 coating and Zr(4+) doping also further enhances the layered structure stability and mitigates the voltage fade during lithiation/delithiation cycles. Moreover, the proposed synchronous lithiation coating route avoids the duplicated high-temperature calcinations and can also be widely used to modify some other cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "The rapid extinction of the fossil fuels across the globe has led to the technological advancements in the field of renewable energy sector and the electric vehicular technology. In order to match the paradigm shift in the energy sector and the technology, the battery charging circuitry of electric vehicle (EV) led to the revolutionary changes in the field of power electronics. Accordingly, various conventional topologies of DC‐DC converters were evolved. But there are a few drawbacks such as bulkiness, nonmultiple ports, and less control over the output current ripple. This work proposes a DC‐DC converter which is a hybrid combination of the full‐bridge converter and the zeta converter. The current and the voltage reversals at the high‐frequency transformer (HFT) terminals are made steady by anti‐interleaving the zeta converters on the secondary side. The control pulses of the full‐bridge converter are phase‐shifted to have the tight grip over the output. The modes of operation of the proposed DC‐DC converter has have presented. The calculation of the energy, current, and the voltage for the active and the passive components of the proposed converter has been provided. The proposed system is simulated, and the plots of the voltages and currents of different components of the converter are presented. The converter prototype has been developed to charge a 36 V lithium‐ion battery, and the effect of the phase shift on input current can be seen from the exhaustive results. The comparison of the calculated and simulated currents and voltages has been graphically illustrated. The proposed converter provides a novel converter topology which includes better output control with phase shift and reduced size of memory elements due to high‐frequency switching.",

        "abstract": "In this study, an organic‐inorganic hybrid polymer membrane is successfully designed and developed by grafting stearyl methacrylate (SMA) side chains onto the backbone of the P(VDF‐HFP) copolymer followed by blending with varying amounts of imidazolium ionic liquids functionalized ZrO2 nanoparticles. Different microporous gel polymer electrolytes (MGPEs) are prepared by immersing the membranes into a LiTFSI salt‐dissolved ionic liquid electrolyte. The membranes' crystallinity, surface morphology, porosity, and thermal stability are investigated using various characterization techniques. The copolymer membrane blended with 60 wt% functionalized nanoparticles exhibits the highest porosity of 64.5 %, which allows it to achieve a maximum electrolyte uptake of 387 wt%. That enables the corresponding MGPE to achieve the highest room temperature lithium ion conductivity of ~5.34 ×10‒3 S cm−1 with a wide electrochemical stability window and good electrochemical stability against Li metal. Leveraging these advantageous characteristics, the lab‐scale truly solid‐state Li|MGPE|LiFePO4 and Li|MGPE|LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cells demonstrate excellent rate capability and reversible cycling stability while maintaining high specific capacities (up to 154 and 172 mAh g‐1, respectively, at 0.5 C) with >99.0% coulombic efficiency over 100 cycles. Such exceptional interfacial compatibility with both low‐ and high‐voltage cathodes establishes the applicability of these newly developed MGPEs in next‐generation all‐solid‐state lithium‐metal batteries.",

        "abstract": "\n The atypical failure mechanism caused by the inclusion of lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) salt in lithium-ion batteries (LIB) is elucidated. When subjected to elevated temperature cycling, the LiFSI salt triggers the degradation of the aluminum current collector, leading to the dissolution of Al ions into the electrolyte. These dissolved Al ions then migrate toward the negative electrode surface where they spontaneously reduce and form Al deposits due to the low electrode potential. This Al deposition further catalyzes the cathodic decomposition of the electrolyte, impacting the interphasial resistance of the negative electrode and consuming both Li ions and electrolyte components. Upon extended cycling with LiFSI-containing electrolytes, a notable decline in the reversible capacity of LIB becomes evident due to cross-talk failure resulting from Al current collector corrosion. Consequently, to enhance the cycling performance of LIBs using LiFSI-based electrolytes, it is necessary to simultaneously prevent Al corrosion and subsequent deposition on the surface of the negative electrode.",

        "abstract": "With the widespread use of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in electric vehicles, it is essential for battery management systems (BMS) to accurately estimate the state of health (SOH) of the battery. This study constructs a regression estimation model applicable to the SOH of LIBs by combining multifeature signal analysis with a data-driven approach. First, the collected data were smoothed using advanced filtering methods to extract input features characterizing capacity degradation properties from differential thermal voltammetry (DTV) curves, incremental capacity analysis (ICA) curves, meantime decay (MTD) curves, and terminal thermal analysis (TTA) curves. Then, the extracted features are subjected to feature fusion using principal component analysis (PCA) to obtain strongly correlated features with a cumulative contribution of 98% or more as inputs to the data-driven model and the hyperparameters of the group method of data handling (GMDH) network are optimized using simulated annealing genetic algorithm (SAGA). Finally, model construction, validation, and comparison are carried out using NASA and Oxford battery datasets. The root mean square error (RMSE) between the actual measured value and the estimated value is obtained to be less than 0.3%, and the $R^{2}$ value is as high as 0.99. The results demonstrate that the approach can efficiently catch the phenomenon of capacity regeneration. It is valid and robust for SOH estimation for different types of LIBs.",

        "abstract": "Spinel Li4Ti5O12 is considered as a promising anode material for long-life lithium ion batteries due to the negligible volumetric variation during the insertion and extraction of the Li ion. Phase transition is an inevitable process during the migration of the Li ion and the transition process and mechanism need detailed investigation down to atomic scale. In this study, we investigated the behavior and mechanism on the phase transition of Li4Ti5O12 through in situ transmission electron microscopy. It has been found that the spinel structured Li4Ti5O12 was gradually transformed to rocksalt structured under electron beam irradiation. A sharp interface with an epitaxial relationship was observed between the transformed rocksalt phase and the parent spinel phase. Furthermore, the heterostructure with different crystal structures of Li4Ti5O12 has been precisely tailored with electron beam irradiation. Our detailed in situ TEM results and theoretical calculations lead to unprecedented level on understanding of phase transition mechanism in Li4Ti5O12. This study demonstrates a possible approach to precisely engineer the crystal structure of materials and to realize well-designed heterostructure in electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "Safety and high-voltage operation are key metrics for advanced, solid-state energy storage devices to power low- or zero-emission HEV or EV vehicles. In this study, we propose the modification of single-ion conducting polyelectrolytes by designing novel block copolymers, which combine one block responsible for high ionic conductivity and the second block for improved mechanical properties and outstanding electrochemical stability. To synthesize such block copolymers, the ring opening polymerization (ROP) of trimethylene carbonate (TMC) monomer by the RAFT-agent having a terminal hydroxyl group is used. It allows for the preparation of a poly(carbonate) macro-RAFT precursor that is subsequently applied in RAFT copolymerization of lithium 1-[3-(methacryloyloxy)propylsulfonyl]-1-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate. The resulting single-ion conducting block copolymers show improved viscoelastic properties, good thermal stability (Tonset up to 155 °C), sufficient ionic conductivity (up to 3.7 × 10–6 S cm–1 at 70 °C), and high lithium-ion transference number (0.91) to enable high power. Excellent plating/stripping ability with resistance to dendrite growth and outstanding electrochemical stability window (exceeding 4.8 V vs Li+/Li at 70 °C) are also achieved, along with enhanced compatibility with composite cathodes, both LiNiMnCoO2 – NMC and LiFePO4 – LFP, as well as the lithium metal anode. Lab-scale truly solid-state Li/LFP and Li/NMC lithium-metal cells assembled with the single-ion copolymer electrolyte demonstrate reversible and very stable cycling at 70 °C delivering high specific capacity (up to 145 and 118 mAh g–1, respectively, at a C/20 rate) and proper operation even at a higher current regime. Remarkably, the addition of a little amount of propylene carbonate (∼8 wt %) allows for stable, highly reversible cycling at a higher C-rate. These results represent an excellent achievement for a truly single-ion conducting solid-state polymer electrolyte, placing the obtained ionic block copolymers on top of polyelectrolytes with highest electrochemical stability and potentially enabling safe, practical Li-metal cells operating at high-voltage.",

The full battery capacity remains stable for 100 cycles at 1 C and the rate performance is excellent (103 mAh g-1 at 3 C). This LBG@XG is demonstrated to be highly electronegative and has a strong attraction to SiOx/C particles, thereby reducing the expansion and increasing the stability of the SiOx/C anodes when coupled with the flexible binder network.

        "abstract": "Achieving compatibility of composite solid electrolytes among materials for fabricating lithium‐ion batteries presents a significant challenge. This work aimed to study the role of the ZSM‐5 zeolite paracrystalline on the compatibility of CMCh‐based CSE. The ZSM‐5 zeolite intermediates and products were synthesized using the free organic template method, while the CSE membranes were fabricated by combining CMCh, ZSM‐5, and lithium perchlorate (LiClO4) using the solution‐casting method. The result showed that the synthesis of ZSM‐5 zeolite has been successfully performed. FTIR spectrum at wavenumber ~950 cm−1 of ZSM‐5 zeolite indicates that secondary building unit (SBU) structures exist. The SBU structure of ZSM‐5 zeolite indicates the paracrystalline structure of ZSM‐5 zeolite, which is compatible with the CMCh structure. The characterizations in this work were conducted to study the interaction, morphology, crystallinity index, thermal stability, mechanical strength, and ionic conductivity through FTIR, SEM, XRD, TGA, tensile tester, and EIS, respectively. The CSE of CMCh/Z5AH‐LiClO4 was the optimum condition exhibiting ionic conductivity as high as 4.35 x 10−6 S cm−1 with a crystallinity index of 34.25 %, a tensile strength of 46.67 MPa and onset thermal degradation of 262.61 °C.

        "abstract": "It is well known that the microstructure of electrodes in lithium‐ion batteries has an immense impact on their overall performance. The compaction load during the calendering process mainly determines the resulting morphology of the electrode. Therefore, NCM‐based cathode films from uncompacted (0 MPa) to most highly compacted (1000 MPa) were manufactured, which corresponds to global porosities ranging from about 50% to 18%. All samples have been imaged using synchrotron tomography. These image data allow an extensive analysis of the 3D cathode microstructure with respect to increasing compaction. In addition, the numerous microstructural changes can be quantified using several characteristics describing the morphology of cathode samples. Three characteristics, namely global porosity, global volume fraction of active material and mean cathode thickness, are compared to experimental results. In addition, the microstructural analysis by means of 3D image data and image processing techniques allows the investigation of characteristics which are hard or impossible to ascertain by experiments, for example the continuous pore size distribution and the sphericity distribution of NCM‐particles. Finally, the dependency of microstructural characteristics on compaction load is described by the help of parametric probability distributions. This approach can be used, for example, to predict the distribution of a certain characteristic for an ‘unknown’ compaction load, which is a valuable information with regard to the optimization and development process of NCM‐cathodes in lithium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "To ensure safe operation, the high-precision estimation of the state of charge (SOC) in the battery management system (BMS) is relied on. The classical recurrent neural network (RNN) has a gradient and poor accuracy problem, and the RNN with additional gates is complex and hard to apply in engineering. To address these issues, the RNN with small sequence trained by multi-level optimization is proposed in this paper to improve the accuracy and the gradient problem of the SOC estimation. First, the small sequence is introduced to improve the gradient problem and running speed of RNN and the SOC post filter is used to increase the continuity of SOC estimation. Then, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to pre-train the RNN to obtain the optimal weight and threshold value, and the hybrid optimizer of Adam and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is utilized to improve the accuracy of SOC estimation. The experimental data of the charging and discharging test, and the performances of the proposed method, the nonlinear autoregressive with exogeneous inputs neural network (NARX), RNN, long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU) for estimating the SOC of lithium batteries are compared. The results show that the estimation error of the RNN is within 3.66% and that of NARX is within 6%, and the proposed method, LSTM, and GRU reduce the error to 0.47%, 1.04%, and 0.48%, respectively. Moreover, the calculation time of the proposed method is 1/3 and 1/9 of that of LSTM and GRU. Besides, the proposed method is robust to different vehicle cycles, measurement noises, temperature variations, and battery aging.",

        "abstract": "Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery systems are critical elements of future energy systems and electric vehicles. Accurate prediction of the state of charge (SoC) is necessary for the safe and reliable functioning of Li-ion battery systems. Achieving a precise SOC estimate is challenging due to the nonlinear characteristics and variations of model parameters caused over the cell lifetime. This paper introduces an adaptive estimation strategy that can compensate for the effect of cell degradation for achieving high accuracy SoC estimation. The proposed method uses an integral correction-based SoC estimation loop utilizing a Li-ion cell model. The effect of model parameter variation is corrected by introducing two additional correction factors, the cell model resistance, and capacity correction factor. These correction factors are employed to update the Li-ion cell model, resulting in an adaptive integral correction-based SoC estimation technique that can compensate for the influence of cyclic degradation-induced parameter change. The proposed method is validated through extensive simulations in the Matlab-Simulink environment, and its output is compared to the existing unscented Kalman filter-based SoC estimation method. The proposed estimation strategy can adapt to the cell circumstances and correct for model uncertainties. The results indicate that the proposed adaptive SoC estimation strategy provides more precise and accurate SoC estimates for the entire lifespan of the Li-ion cell.",

        "abstract": "Advancing electrochemical energy storage devices relies on versatile analytical tools capable of revealing the molecular mechanisms behind the function and degradation of battery materials in situ. The nuclear magnetic resonance phenomenon plays a pivotal role in fundamental studies of energy materials and devices because of its exceptional sensitivity to local environments and the dynamics of many electrochemically relevant elements. The jelly roll architecture is one of the most energy-dense and, therefore, most popular concepts implemented in pouch, prismatic, and cylindrical Li- and Na-ion cells. Such widely commercialized designs, however, represent a significant obstacle for a range of powerful in situ magnetic resonance-based methodologies due to negligible radio frequency electromagnetic field penetration through conductive metal casings and current collectors. In this work, we introduce an experimental setup that enables direct RF wave transmission through the cell terminals and current collectors, and provides efficient excitation and detection of NMR signals. An RF adapter designed as a plug-and-play device effectively turns the battery cell into an NMR probe that can be tuned to a broad range of Larmor frequencies. Due to its exceptional sensitivity, versatility, and multinuclear capability, the proposed methodology is suitable for fundamental research and industrial high-throughput screening applications. In situ NMR lineshapes provide a direct quantitative description of the chemical environments of electrochemically active elements and enable new metrics for the accurate assessment of state-of-charge (SoC) and state-of-health (SoH). Specifically, in commercial pouch cells based on lithium cobalt oxide, lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide, and sodium nickel iron manganese oxide chemistries, 7Li and 23Na NMR data unambiguously show electrochemical transformations between intercalated and metallic forms of charge carrier ions, and reveal anisotropic magnetic properties of the electrode coating.",

The electrolytes of interest are mixtures of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt and symmetric poly(styrene-block-ethylene oxide) copolymers (SEO). In contrast to current solid and liquid electrolytes, the conductivity of SEO/salt mixtures increases with increasing molecular weight of the copolymers. EFTEM results show that the salt is increasingly localized in the middle of the poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) lamellae as the molecular weight of the copolymers is increased. Calculations of the inhomogeneous local stress field in block copolymer microdomains, modeled using self-consistent field theory, provide a quantitative explanation for this observation. These stresses, which increase with increasing molecular weight, interfere with the ability of PEO chains to coordinate with lithium cations near the walls of the PEO channels where ion mobility is expected to be low.",

        "abstract": "Overdischarge is a severe safety issue that can induce severe mechanical failure of electrode materials in lithium-ion batteries. A considerable volume change of silicon-based composite anodes undoubtedly further aggravates the mechanical failure. However, the mechanical failure mechanism of silicon-based composite anodes under overdischarging conditions still lacks in-depth understanding despite many efforts paid under normal charging conditions. Herein, we have modeled and tracked the mechanical failure evolution of silicon/carbon nanofibers, a typical silicon-based anode, under overdischarging conditions based on the finite element simulation, with derived optimization strategies of optimal Young's modulus and stable microstructure. The severe contact damage between silicon nanoparticles and carbon nanofibers, which causes larger shedding and breakage risks, has been found to contribute to mechanical failure. To improve the electrode stability, an optimal Young's modulus interval ranging from ∼75 to ∼150 GPa is found. Furthermore, increasing the embedding depth of silicon nanoparticles in carbon nanofibers has proven to be an effective strategy for improving electrochemical stability due to the faster lithium salt diffusion and more uniform current density distribution, which was further verified by the experimental capacity retention ratio of carbon-coated silicon and silicon/carbon nanofibers (84 vs 75% after 100 cycles). Our results provide meaningful insights into the mechanical failure of silicon-based composite anodes during overdischarging, giving reasonable guidance for electrode safety designs and performance optimization.",

        "abstract": "Recently, dual-ion batteries (DIBs) have received immense attention owing to their high operating voltage and low cost, and further studies on the enhancement of their energy densities and cyclabilities are being intensively pursued. Herein, a novel Ge-based DIB has been developed for the first time by using a rationally designed nanocomposite of Ge particles embedded in one-dimensional carbon nanofibers (Ge/CNFs) as an anode. The resulting battery shows a high discharge capacity of 281 mA h g-1 at a discharge current of 0.25 A g-1 and a superb rate capability of 94 mA h g-1 at a discharge current of 2.5 A g-1, which greatly surpasses those of most of the reported DIBs. These remarkable properties can be ascribed to the fact that the uniform one-dimensional nanostructure facilitates the improvement of lithium-ion diffusion within the hybrids, and the carbon matrix effectively alleviates the volume expansion of Ge during the cycling process and simultaneously enhances the electrical conductivity of the hybrids. The charge storage mechanism of Ge/CNFs is found to be Ge alloying with Li, accompanied by a phase transformation process from crystalline Ge to amorphous LixGe alloys. This work paves the way for the rational utilization of Ge-based materials in new-generation high-performance DIBs.",

Firstly, a novel definition of the battery pack SOE is proposed, which considers the inconsistency of the battery pack. Secondly, the thermo-electric lumped parameter equivalent circuit model of a single cell in the battery pack is applied. The electrical parameters are identified using the forgetting factor recursive least-squares algorithm, and the extended Kalman filter is used to estimate the SOC of each cell. Finally, the future current, voltage and temperature response of the cell in the battery pack are accurately predicted and iterative calculations are performed to get SOE under the condition that the future output power of the battery pack is predicted by the Markov chain model method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified under dynamic conditions at different temperatures. The results show that the above method has high precision and good robustness, and can meet the needs of actual vehicle applications.",

Conventional PVDF binder is a passive polymer lacking the ability to transport Li+/Na+ and facilitate ion kinetics. This limitation poses constraints in achieving high specific capacity, fast charging, and long cycle life. Herein, a novel water‐soluble concentrated imidazolium functionalized poly(ionic liquid), poly(oxycarbonylmethylene 1‐allyl‐3‐methyimidazolium) (PMAI) is synthesized, and evaluated it as binder in LIB/SIB. PMAI‐based anodic‐half cell exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, achieving higher capacities (297 mAhg−1 at 1C for LIBs and 250 mAhg−1 at 60 mAg−1 for SIBs) and good cycle stability (80 % capacity retention after 750 cycles for LIBs; 96% capacity retention after 200 cycles for SIBs), compared to PVDF binder. In addition, PMAI/Gr delivers a higher discharge capacity of 85 mAhg−1 than PVDF/Gr with 47 mAhg−1 at 5C. PMAI‐containing electrodes show better rate capability at different current densities than PVDF binder in LIB/SIB. The enhanced ion diffusion coefficient, lower resistance and decreased activation energy of desolvation, are ascribed to densely polar ionic liquid groups along the polymer and formation of a functionalized SEI via binder reduction. The novel PMAI binder's design and full‐cell examination confirm its potential in secondary‐ion battery applications.",

        "abstract": "π-Conjugated molecule bridged silicon quantum dots (Si QDs) cluster was prepared by Sonogashira C–C cross-coupling reaction between 4-bromostyryl and octyl co-capped Si QDs (4-Bs/Oct Si QDs) and 1,4-diethynylbenzene. The surface chemical structure, morphology, and chemical composition of the Si QD cluster were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Lithium-ion batteries were fabricated using 4-Bs/Oct Si QD and Si QD clusters as anode materials to investigate the effect of QD clustering on the electrochemical performance. Compared with the 4-Bs/Oct Si QD electrode, the Si QD cluster exhibits improved electrochemical performance, such as a high initial discharge capacity of ∼1957 mAh/g and good cycling stability with ∼63% capacity retention following 100 cycles at a current rate of 200 mA/g when tested at the voltage window of 0.01–2.5 V. The improved electrochemical performance of the Si QD cluster is attributed to the π-conjugated molecules between the Si QDs and on the surface of Si QD cluster, which serve as a buffer layer to alleviate the mechanical stresses arising from the alloying reaction of Si with lithium and maintain the electrical conduits in the anode system.",

        "abstract": "Mesoporous hybrids of V2O5 nanoparticles anchored on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have been synthesized by slow hydrolysis of vanadium oxytriisopropoxide using a two-step solvothermal method followed by vacuum annealing. The hybrid material possesses a hierarchical structure with 20-30 nm V2O5 nanoparticles uniformly grown on rGO nanosheets, leading to a high surface area with mesoscale porosity. Such hybrid materials present significantly improved electronic conductivity and fast electrolyte ion diffusion, which synergistically enhance the electrical energy storage performance. Symmetrical electrochemical capacitors with two rGO-V2O5 hybrid electrodes show excellent cycling stability, good rate capability, and a high specific capacitance up to ∼466 F g(-1) (regarding the total mass of V2O5) in a neutral aqueous electrolyte (1.0 M Na2SO4). When used as the cathode in lithium-ion batteries, the rGO-V2O5 hybrid demonstrates excellent cycling stability and power capability, able to deliver a specific capacity of 295, 220, and 132 mAh g(-1) (regarding the mass of V2O5) at a rate of C/9, 1C, and 10C, respectively. The value at C/9 rate matches the full theoretical capacity of V2O5 for reversible 2 Li(+) insertion/extraction between 4.0 and 2.0 V (vs Li/Li(+)). It retains ∼83% of the discharge capacity after 150 cycles at 1C rate, with only 0.12% decrease per cycle. The enhanced performance in electrical energy storage reveals the effectiveness of rGO as the structure template and more conductive electron pathway in the hybrid material to overcome the intrinsic limits of single-phase V2O5 materials.",

The increased tendency of ion complex formation for LiBF4 is reflected by lower values regarding the measured and computed effective ionic conductivities when compared to LiTFSI.

        "abstract": "The performance of energy storage materials is often governed by their structure at the atomic scale. Conventional electron microscopy can provide detailed information about materials at these length scales, but direct imaging of light elements such as lithium presents a challenge. While several recent techniques allow lithium columns to be distinguished, these typically either involve complex contrast mechanisms that make image interpretation difficult or require significant expertise to perform. Here, we demonstrate how center-of-mass scanning transmission electron microscopy (CoM-STEM) provides an enhanced ability for simultaneous imaging of lithium and heavier element columns in lithium ion conductors. Through a combination of experiments and multislice electron scattering calculations, we show that CoM-STEM is straightforward to perform and produces directly interpretable contrast for thin samples, while being more robust to variations in experimental parameters than previously demonstrated techniques. As a result, CoM-STEM is positioned to become a reliable and facile method for directly probing all elements within energy storage materials at the atomic scale.",

        "abstract": "Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are regarded as potential next-generation energy storage systems due to their high theoretical energy densities. However, the dissolution of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) upon cycling can result in severe capacity degradation. Achieving high rate capabilities with good cycling stability remains a huge obstacle for the practical implementation of Li-S batteries. Here we developed a novel, multifunctional, hierarchical structure by self-assembling core-shell MnO2 nanorods @ hollow porous carbon with 2D Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, labelled as MCT, as an efficient polysulfide mediator for Li-S cathodes. The integration of the polar MnO2 core and hollow porous carbon shell captures LiPSs two ways: physical confinement and chemisorption. The conductive Ti3C2Tx nanosheets construct a continuous and conductive network, which not only promotes charge transfer and ion diffusion but also boosts LiPS adsorption and conversion. Based on these merits, the MCT/S cathode delivers good rate capability (688 mA h g-1 at 2.0C) and outstanding long-term cyclability (0.044% capacity decay per cycle over 600 cycles at 2.0C).",

        "title": "Is the ‘Single-Crystal’ Approach Truly Feasible for Ni-Rich Layered Oxides? – a Fair and Realistic Performance Comparison in Ncm||Graphite Coin Cells",
        "abstract": "Secondary particle cracking induced by anisotropic volume change during cycling has been identified as a major failure mechanism of state-of-the-art Ni-rich layered oxide cathodes like Li[Ni\n x\n Co\n y\n Mn\n z\n ]O2 (x + y + z = 1, NCMxyz where x ≥ 0.8) as it allows surface-related degradation phenomena such as inactive phase formation, transition metal dissolution and ongoing electrolyte decomposition to continue on newly formed, highly reactive surface cycle after cycle.1 The approach of designing ‘single-crystal’ (SC) particles is believed to mitigate this issue by replacing polycrystalline secondary agglomerates (PC) by well-separated micron-sized primary particles that can prolong the cycle life of the material by improving its morphological integrity.2\n \n Particle cracking in layered oxide cathode materials is exacerbated with increasing Ni-content which qualifies the ‘single-crystal’ approach especially for Ni-rich NCMs (x ≥ 0.8). Despite this, meaningful long-term cycling studies are still scarce as two main challenges obstruct a fair evaluation of the ‘single-crystal’ approach: \n \n The synthesis of Ni-rich SC-NCMs is not straightforward as the conditions required for enhanced crystal growth (e. higher calcination temperature and/or a molten-salt environment requiring a washing step) are inherently damaging to Ni-rich materials.3 This often leads to comparisons between materials where factors other than morphology cannot be excluded (e.g. synthesis from different precursors, different post-processing steps, undisclosed dopants/coatings in commercial materials, etc.).\n \n \n The larger crystal size of SC-NCMs compared to PC-NCMs is believed to cause kinetic limitations impacting achievable capacities and rate performance.4 As a consequence, either the ‘single-crystal’ sample is cycled in a lower state-of-charge window despite the same same upper cut-off voltage or the polycrystalline reference sample is cycled at an unnecessarily high voltage. Both conditions favor the ‘single-crystal’ material.\n \n \n \n The objective of this work was to establish a fair comparison between the two morphologies. For this purpose, a series of ‘single-crystal’ Li[Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1]O2 (SC-NCM811) materials with varying particle sizes where synthesized. To deconvolute the effect of particle size and morphology from other influences, a molten salt-assisted synthesis was followed, so that bulk properties of SC-NCMs remained constant and PC-NCM reference samples could be synthesized from the same home-made precursors and with the same post-processing steps. The samples were thoroughly characterized in terms of physicochemical properties and their electrochemical performance was evaluated in NCM||Li and NCM||Graphite coin cells. The performance of PC- and SC-NCM811 was compared at the same upper cutoff voltage and again at the same state-of-charge window to compare the materials as fairly as possible.\n References:\n (1) de Biasi, L.; Schwarz, B.; Brezesinski, T.; Hartmann, P.; Janek, J.; Ehrenberg, H.

        "abstract": "In this study, the heat transfer model of a radiation–conduction–convection coupled lithium-ion battery pack is established through theoretical analysis. The temperature distribution and flow field distribution inside the battery pack are obtained by simulation using ANSYS Fluent software 2022 R1, and the reasonableness of the simulation model is verified with an experiment. This study also analyzes in detail the improvement effect of adding heat dissipation ribs, applying heat dissipation coatings, and adjusting the fan speed on the heat dissipation performance of the system. Under the same heat sink rib height conditions, the relationship between its thickness and total heat dissipation and thermal efficiency is studied in depth, and the temperature distribution of the cell under different rib thicknesses is obtained. At the same time, the emissivity of the heat sink coating under different coating thicknesses was measured by infrared thermography, and the relevant design values were determined through simulation experiments. Finally, based on the experimental test results of fan performance, a corresponding control strategy is proposed to construct an efficient and high-performance multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) battery thermal management system. The experimental results show that optimizing the structure of the forced air cooling system through the above measures can ensure that the Li-ion battery operates within the efficient operating temperature range, thus extending its cycle life, improving its stability, and reducing the risk of thermal runaway. Meanwhile, the problem of excessive temperature difference between different modules is improved, and the output capacity of the energy storage system is increased.",

        "abstract": "Ni‐rich layered oxide cathode material with Ni contents greater than 90% is considered as a highly promising candidate for lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) owing to its remarkable specific capacity and cost‐efficiency. However, severe capacity degradation caused by the structural collapse and interfacial instability with electrolyte under high voltage greatly hinders the practical application. Here, an antimony (Sb)‐doped LiNi0.91Co0.06Al0.03O2 (Sb‐NCA91) cathode is proposed, where the Sb doping modifies the morphology of primary particles and enables the radially aligned microstructure. This unique microstructure can disperse the anisotropic mechanical stress caused by the H2‐H3 phase transformation, and mitigate the shrinkage and expansion of the primary particles during high‐voltage and low‐temperature cycling, thus inhibiting the formation of microcracks and structural deterioration. Meanwhile, the closely arranged radial spokes allow fast ion transport in the secondary particles and effectively improve the rate performance and low‐temperature performance of the cathodes. As a result, the Sb modified cathode demonstrates superior capacity retention of ≈84% at 1 C after 200 cycles in 2.7–4.5 V at 25 °C, while the pristine NCA91 cathode only retains ≈79%. Additionally, the capacity retention at −20 °C is significantly increased from ≈61% (NCA91) to ≈88% (Sb‐NCA91) after 100 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Lithium‐sulfur batteries face challenges like polysulfide shuttle and slow conversion kinetics, hindering their practical applications in renewable energy storage and electric vehicles. Herein, a solution to solve this issue is reported by using a cation vacancy engineering strategy with rational synthesis of La‐deficient LaCoO3 (LCO‐VLa). The introduction of cation vacancies in LCO‐VLa modifies the geometric structure of coordinating atoms, exposing Co‐rich surface with more catalytically active surfaces. Meanwhile, the d‐band center of LCO‐VLa shifts toward the Fermi level, enhancing polysulfide adsorption. Furthermore, multivalent cobalt ions (Co3+/Co4+) induced by charge compensation enhance the electrical conductivity of LCO‐VLa, accelerating electron transfer processes and improving catalytic performance. Theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations demonstrate that La‐deficient LCO‐VLa effectively suppresses the polysulfide shuttle, reduces the energy barrier for polysulfide conversion, and accelerates redox reaction kinetics. LCO‐VLa‐based batteries demonstrate exceptional rate performance and cycling stability, retaining 70% capacity after nearly 500 cycles at 1.0 C, with a minimal decay rate of 0.055% per cycle. These findings highlight the significance of cation vacancy engineering for exploring precise structure‐activity relationships during polysulfides conversion, facilitating the rational design of catalysts at the atomic level for lithium‐sulfur batteries.",

However, the outstanding properties reported for new electrode materials may not necessarily be applicable to performance of electrochemical capacitors (ECs). These devices, also called supercapacitors or ultra-capacitors (4), store charge with ions from solution at charged porous electrodes. Unlike batteries, which store large amounts of energy but deliver it slowly, ECs can deliver energy faster (develop high power), but only for a short time. However, recent work has claimed energy densities for ECs approaching (5) or even exceeding that of batteries. We show that even when some metrics seem to support these claims, actual device performance may be rather mediocre. We will focus here on ECs, but these considerations also apply to lithium (Li)—ion batteries.",

Here, we approach the issue of using solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) vs. NMC cathodes by employing a range of materials based on poly(ϵ‐caprolactone‐co‐trimethylene carbonate) (PCL‐PTMC) with different salts under various cycling conditions. It is seen that although the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte can be improved by exchanging the lithium salt, it does not immediately correlate to better cycling performance. However, increasing the temperature during battery cycling to improve the ion transport kinetics lowers the polarization of the battery cell and full capacity can be achieved at an upper voltage cut‐off that is appropriate for the polymer electrolyte. For these electrolytes, the limit is demonstrated to be 4.4 V vs. Li+/Li, and cycling with NMC‐111 cathodes is thereby possible provided that the upper cut‐off is limited to below this limit.",

Here, a reversible three-electron reaction is demonstrated utilizing topotactic phase transition between antifluorite and rocksalt in a cation-disordered antifluorite-type cubic Li6CoO4 cathode. This cubic phase is synthesized by a simple mechanochemical treatment of conventionally prepared tetragonal Li6CoO4. It displays a reversible capacity of 487 mAh g-1, a high value due to a reversible three-electron reaction using Co2+/Co3+, Co3+/Co4+, and O2-/O22- redox, occurring without O2 gas evolution. The mechanochemical treatment is assumed to reduce its lattice distortion by cation-disordering, and facilitate a reversible topotactic phase transition between antifluorite and rocksalt structures via dynamic cation pushing mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) plays a key role in Industry 4.0 revolution by providing smart predictive maintenance solutions. Early failure detection and prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) of critical industrial machines/components are the main challenges addressed by PHM methodologies. In literature, model-based and data-driven methods are widely used for RUL estimation. Model-based methods rely on empirical/phenomenological degradation models for RUL prediction using Bayesian formulations. In many cases, the lack of accurate physics-based models emphasizes the need to resort to machine learning based prognostic algorithms. However, data-driven methods require extensive machine failure data incorporating all possible operating conditions along with all possible failure modes pertaining to that particular machine / component, which are seldom available in their entirety. In this work, we propose a three-stage hybrid prognostic algorithm (HyA) combining model-based (Particle Filters-PF) and data-driven (Neural Networks-NN) methods in a unique way. The proposed method aims to overcome the need for accurate degradation modeling or extensive failure data sets. In the first stage, a feedforward neural network is used to formulate lithium-ion battery’s degradation trends and the corresponding NN model parameters are used to define the initial prior distribution of PF algorithm. In the second stage, the PF algorithm optimizes the model parameters and the posterior model parameter distributions are utilized to ‘warm-start’ the neural network used for prognosis and the third/final stages focuses on prognosis and RUL estimation using the trained NN model leveraging on the posterior distributions of the PF fine-tuned weights and biases. The proposed method is demonstrated on CALCE and NASA lithium-ion battery capacity degradation datasets. The efficacy of the proposed hybrid algorithm is evaluated using root mean square error (RMSE) values and alpha-lambda prognostic metrics. Also, the impact of the NN architecture on the prediction accuracy and computational load are analyzed.",

When the PP-SiO2 separator is used for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, the cyclic stability and rate capability of the batteries are greatly enhanced. The capacity retention ratio of the Li-S battery configured with the PP-SiO2 separator is 64% after 200 cycles at 0.2 C, which is much higher than that configured with the PP separator (45%). Moreover, the rate capacity of the Li-S batteries using the PP-SiO2 separator reaches 956.3, 691.5, 621, and 567.6 mAh g-1 at the current density of 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 C, respectively.

        "abstract": "Diagnosing lithium‐ion battery degradation is a crucial part of managing energy storage systems. Recent research has explored ultrasonic testing for non‐invasive health assessment as an alternative to traditional, time‐consuming, electrical‐only methods. Assessing the state of health is vi‐ tal for determining quality at end of ‘first’ life, with retired batteries at 70−80% health still holding value for second‐ life applications. Over the coming years, tens of GWh of salvaged batteries will hit the market, requiring rapid non‐ invasive methods to classify retired batteries according to their state of health. This study uses a 64−element ultrasonic array to obtain mid‐band quantitative ultrasound spectroscopy parameters—including mid‐band fit, spectral slope, and intercept—from circumferential waves around cylindrical batteries. Thirteen cylindrical cells were used to evaluate the methodology: three pristine and ten retired from the same source. The mid‐band fit showed the ability to track the state of charge and discriminate between the state of health levels in accelerated degradation experiments both with pristine batteries, and also with recovered second‐ life batteries with unknown historical use. Linear‐array ultrasonic transducers, coupled with quantitative spectral parameters, show promise for future non‐destructive battery health screening methods, offering valuable insights for the emerging used battery market.",

        "abstract": "Red phosphorus (RP) with a high theoretical specific capacity (2596 mA h g-1) and a moderate lithiation potential (∼0.7 V vs Li+/Li) holds promise as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), which still confronts discernible challenges, including low electrical conductivity, substantial volumetric expansion of 300%, and the shuttle effect induced by soluble lithium polyphosphide (LixPPs). Here, S-NRP@Ti3C2Tx composites were in situ prepared through a phosphorus-amine-based method, wherein S-doped red phosphorus nanoparticles (S-NRP) grew and anchored on the crumpled Ti3C2Tx nanosheets via Ti-O-P bonds, constructing a three-dimensional porous structure which provides fast channels for ion and electron transport and effectively buffers the volume expansion of RP. Interestingly, based on the results of adsorption experiments of polyphosphate and DFT calculation, Ti3C2Tx with abundant oxygen functional groups delivers a strong chemical adsorption effect on LixPPs, thus suppressing the shuttle effect and reducing irreversible capacity loss. Furthermore, S-doping improved the conductivity of red phosphorus nanoparticles, facilitating Li-P redox kinetics. Hence, the S-NRP@Ti3C2Tx anode demonstrates outstanding rate performance (1824 and 1090 mA h g-1 at 0.2 and 4.0 A g-1, respectively) and superior cycling performance (1401 mAh g-1 after 500 cycles at 2.0 A g-1).",

Herein, we report the preparation of fluorine-doped graphdiyne by exposure to XeF2 under a mild temperature. Compared to pristine graphdiyne, the capacities are doubled. We obtained reversible capacities of fluorinated graphdiyne up to 1080 mA h g−1 after 600 cycles at a current density of 500 mA g−1. At a higher current density of 1000 mA g−1, it still retained a high specific capacity of 693 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles. Using in situ quantitative nanomechanical probe atomic force microscopy, we further analyzed the surface morphologies and elastic modulus to understand the mechanism of the electrochemical improvement. The fluorinated graphdiyne elastic modulus is doubled in contrast to pristine graphdiyne.

To ensure accurate online state estimations, an online battery parameter identification algorithm, such as the least square fitting approach, along with a shifting moving window, was developed and implemented, while the decision of the moving window size for general purpose is a technical issue not yet been well-addressed. This paper proposes an adaptive moving window size design methodology that adjusts the moving window size considering three important factors: load profile, state-of-charge to open-circuit voltage profile, and condition of data. The simulation results show that the proposed methodology helps to identify the parameters of the battery electric circuit model with high accuracy, where the results are compatible to the results using fine-tuned fixed window sizes. Also, the proposed methodology is general to driving profiles from moderate to severe without extra algorithm redesign. In the three standard driving profile cases, the parameter identification error is reduced by 59.15%, 69.02%, and 75.14%, respectively, compared to the worst case in experiments, which are compatible with the results after fine-tuning the fixed window sizes. With accurately identified parameters, the modeling error is minimized, and three typical linear SOC estimation algorithms thus render accurate SOC estimation, rendering an average of 13.4%, 64.43% 57.48% reduction from the worst case in experiments, respectively.",

Nevertheless, their huge volume expansion (∼300%) and poor conductivity show the need for the simultaneous introduction of low-density conductive carbon and nanosized Si to conquer the above issues, yet they result in low volumetric performance. Herein, we develop an integration strategy of a dually encapsulated Si structure and dense structural engineering to fabricate a three-dimensional (3D) highly dense Ti3C2Tx MXene and graphene dual-encapsulated Si monolith architecture (HD-Si@Ti3C2Tx@G). Because of its high density (1.6 g cm-3), high conductivity (151 S m-1), and 3D dense dual-encapsulated Si architecture, the resultant HD-Si@Ti3C2Tx@G monolith anode displays an ultrahigh volumetric capacity of 5206 mAh cm-3 (gravimetric capacity: 2892 mAh g-1) at 0.1 A g-1 and a superior long lifespan of 800 cycles at 1.0 A g-1. Notably, the thick and dense monolithic anode presents a large areal capacity of 17.9 mAh cm-2. In-situ TEM and ex-situ SEM techniques, and systematic kinetics and structural stability analysis during cycling demonstrate that such superior volumetric and areal performances stem from its dual-encapsulated Si architecture by the 3D conductive and elastic networks of MXene and graphene, which can provide fast electron and ion transfer, effective volume buffer, and good electrolyte permeability even with a thick electrode, whereas the dense structure results in a large volumetric performance.

        "abstract": "Despite its ultrahigh theoretical capacity and ultralow redox electrochemical potential, the practical application of lithium metal anodes is still hampered by severe dendrite growth and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, a self‐assembled lithiophilic interface (SALI) for regulating Li electroplating behavior is constructed by introducing a meticulously synthesized Ni‐bis(dithiolene)‐based molecule (NiS4‐COOH) into a hybrid fluorinated ester‐ether electrolyte. The NiS4‐COOH molecules with carboxyl functional groups can spontaneously anchor on the Li metal surface to form a SALI, whose abundant Ni‐bis(dithiolene) sites can effectively reduce the initial Li deposition overpotential and guide the subsequent uniform Li electrodeposition. Moreover, due to the interaction between the coordination unsaturated Ni atom and the negatively charged PF6−, the NiS4‐COOH additive can significantly change the ionic coordination environment in the electrolyte, which is greatly conducive to suppressing PF6− decomposition, optimizing SEI composition and accelerating Li‐ion transfer. Consequently, the NiS4‐COOH‐modified electrolyte leads to impressive electrochemical performance of Li||LiFePO4 and Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 batteries, delivering ultrahigh Coulombic efficiencies, considerable capacity retention, and good rate performance even at high areal active material loadings.

        "abstract": "Alternative anode materials with increased theoretical specific capacities are under scrutinity as a replacement to graphite in lithium‐ion batteries (LiBs). Silicon oxides offer increased capacities compared to graphite and do not suffer the same level of material expansion as pure Si. Consequently, they are an intermediate commercial anode material, on the pathway toward pure Si anodes. In this study, stable Silica/carbon (SiO2/C) nanofibers are successfully developed from tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) using poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP). The fibers show excellent stability after calcination, with silica evenly dispersed within the fibers exhibiting a surface area of 327 m2 g−1. This study demonstrates that the electrochemical performance of SiO2/C composite anodes is significantly influenced by the silica content. SiO2/C composites with ≈68 at% SiO2 achieve reversible capacities of 315.6 and 300.9 mAh g−1, after the 2nd, and 800th cycles, respectively, at a specific current of 100 mA g−1, with a remarkable capacity retention of 95.3%. In a second stage, lignin is added as a potential nanostructuring agent. The addition of lignin to the sample reduces the amount of silica without significantly impacting its performance and stability. Tailoring the composition of SiO2/C composite anodes enables stable capacity retention over the course of hundreds of cycles.",

This paper focuses on the thermal safety concerns associated with lithium-ion batteries during usage by specifically investigating high-capacity lithium iron phosphate batteries. To this end, thermal runaway (TR) experiments were conducted to investigate the temperature characteristics on the battery surface during TR, as well as the changes in battery mass and expansion rate before and after TR. Meanwhile, by constructing a TR simulation model tailored to lithium iron phosphate batteries, an analysis was performed to explore the variations in internal material content, the proportion of heat generation from each exothermic reaction, and the influence of the heat transfer coefficient during the TR process. The results indicate that as the heating power increases, the response time of lithium-ion batteries to TR advances. Furthermore, the heat released from the negative electrode–electrolyte reaction emerges as the primary heat source throughout the entire TR process, contributing to 63.1% of the total heat generation.",

        "abstract": "As a typical two-dimensional material possessing sp and sp2 hybrid orbitals, graphdiyne (GDY) and its derivatives have been proposed as an attractive candidate for high-performance lithium ion batteries (LIBs). In this work, an advanced GDY LIB electrode is designed by doping with group-15 elements. With the aid of first-principles simulations, the geometric properties, electronic structures, theoretical storage capacities, open-circuit voltages, and diffusion path of Li atoms on doped GDY are comprehensively investigated. Specifically, 14 different adsorption sites are proposed, most of which are situated out of plane of the carbon network, resulting from the out of plane Pz orbitals of conduction band minimum and valence band maximum. Among the five doped GDY, phosphorus-doped graphdiyne (P-GDY) exhibits prominent lithium ion storage behavior, i.e., the maximum theoretical capacity is 1949 mA·h·g–1, which is ∼2.6 times higher than that of GDY. Moreover, calculation results in terms of the in-plane migration of lithium ion on P-GDY indicate that Li atoms prefer to diffuse across the carbon network (with a moderate barrier of 0.46 eV) rather than directly through the middle of the hexagonal aperture (with a higher barrier of 1.78 eV). Thus, this approach provides novel insights into the Li ion storage properties of group-15 element-doped GDY from the prospect of theoretical calculations, which would be useful to guide the future design of high-capacity GDY anodes for LIBs.",

        "title": "Dry Battery Electrode Manufacturing Enabled By Continuous Powder Mixing",
        "abstract": "Lithium-Ion Battery electrode manufacturing is a cost- and energy-intensive process that usually relies on the use of a hazardous and expensive solvent, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), for cathodes. After coating the battery-slurry to a current collector, the solvent needs to be evaporated to obtain a porous electrode suitable for the use in a Lithium-Ion Battery. The solvent is a processing material and unwanted in the final product. In fact, solvent residues can fuel parasitic side-reactions within the battery cell and hence deteriorate battery lifetime and safety. The utilization of NMP in battery production plants demands costly labor protection and explosion safety measurements during mixing and coating and necessitates a highly energy and floor-space demanding drying step using thermic drying ovens of up to 100 meters.[1] For ecological and economic reasons, NMP is not emitted in large-scale production facilities, but condensed and recycled by distillation. The NMP-recovery system adds additional floor space and energy demand to the production site. The drying and solvent recovery can account for up to 39% of the total energy demand of a Lithium-Ion Battery Cell production and therefore produce significant CO2 emissions.[2] A solvent-free, dry electrode manufacturing that eliminates the use of solvents hence reduces the floor space, energy demand and cost of a production plant and eases safety and environmental concerns. Different approaches have been reported in the literature to put dry coating into practice,[3],[4] yet most strategies, for example spray coating or brush coating, lack of a feasible implementation into large scale production. In contrast, a dry coating approach that is sometimes referred to as the Maxwell-Process is, according to media reports, currently installed at Tesla’s Gigafactories in Berlin and Austin.[5] In fact, a publicly available teardown of a Tesla 4680 battery cell hints that a dry coated anode could already be used in commercial vehicles.[6] Compared to the state-of-the-art electrode manufacturing process, dry coating requires different polymeric binder systems that form spiderweb-like structures of fine fibrils connecting the electrochemical active particles and the conductive additive particles. PTFE is highly suitable since it is stable towards typical electrolytes and cathode materials and is known to easily form fibrils. These properties are also utilized to produce expanded PTFE membranes like Gore-Tex. The fibril-network in the battery context is primarily formed by a high-shear dry mixing process. The powder mixture is then compressed to a free-standing electrode film (powder-to-film) by a heated rolling mill (calender) and the resulting film is ultimately laminated to a current collector foil (film-to-foil). We demonstrate that a twin screw-extruder can be used to tune the degree of binder-fibrillation during dry-mixing of NMC-based cathode mixtures. Extrusion based mixing allows to use powder mixtures with little amounts of PTFE binder (1 wt%) to produce self-supporting, free-standing cathode films and, ultimately, battery electrodes with high flexibility and sufficient mechanical stability. We show a superior rate-performance and cycling-stability of single-layer pouch cells with dry-coated cathodes compared to cells with wet coated reference electrodes of likewise composition and electrode design.

        "title": "Investigating the Reaction Mechanism of Vinylene Carbonate Additive in Lithium Ion Batteries Using X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy",
        "abstract": "The rechargeable Li-ion battery is an enabling technology which facilitates the electrification of the automotive industry and reduces the demand for fossil fuels. During the charge and discharge of a battery, a solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) forms between the liquid electrolyte and the solid negative electrode as a result of electrolyte degradation. The chemical and physical stability and the functionality of the SEI is a key determining factor of battery performance. The chemical composition of the SEI is mainly controlled by the choice of solvent and salt used, but can be manipulated by the addition of electrolyte additives that influence the electrolyte degradation process.\n Vinylene carbonate (VC) is an additive used in many commercial Li-ion battery configurations. The addition of a small amount of VC to ethylene carbonate (EC) containing electrolytes has been demonstrated to drastically improve several performance metrics for batteries including cycle life, coulombic efficiencies, capacity retention and thermal stability. The success of VC is widely attributed to its ability to form a thinner, denser and more robust SEI, which better protects the electrode surface and prevents further electrolyte consumption. This improvement in stability has been linked to the presence of poly(VC) in the SEI, but the mechanism by which VC reacts in EC-containing electrolytes is still an area of ongoing study. Whilst computational methods have suggested several potential decomposition pathways of electrolytes containing VC, it is yet to be convincingly demonstrated experimentally. Whilst there is a general consensus about ‘What?’ forms in the SEI on the addition of VC to EC-containing solvent, this work aims to confirm ‘Where?’ these components are in the interface and the currently unanswered questions of ‘How?’ and ‘Why?’ they form.\n Using highly surface sensitive photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) measurements of the SEI deposited at various potentials, we identify the differences in composition and structure that result from the addition of VC additive to EC-containing electrolytes. The SEI formation is studied using a smooth Au surface as the model working electrode and a fluorine free EC:diethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:9) 1 M LiClO4 electrolyte in an attempt to isolate the impact of VC on the SEI. A potential step procedure allows analysis of the working electrode surface by PES at several progressively more negative potentials on the first charge. Through systematic variation of components such as the concentration of VC, the ratio of EC:DEC and swapping Au for other electrode materials such as Cu or Si, the interaction between VC, EC and the electrode surface is revealed. The differences in SEI composition and structure formed in each environment and at each potential step are correlated to quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) data in order to identify potential reaction mechanisms and formation processes. The results play a key role in understanding the reaction pathway of VC-containing electrolytes and will accelerate development of more efficient electrolyte additives.",

However, the controllability of the exposed facet remains a daunting challenge, and a deep understanding of the correlation between exposed facet and Li+-transfer behavior has been rarely reported. In this work, single-crystal α-Fe2O3 hexagonal nanosheets with an exposed (001) facet are prepared with the assistance of aluminum ions through a one-step hydrothermal process, and structural characterizations reveal an Al3+-concentration-dependent-growth mechanism for the α-Fe2O3 nanosheets. Furthermore, such α-Fe2O3 nanosheets, when used as lithium-ion battery anodes, exhibit high specific capacity (1261.3 mAh g-1 at 200 mA g-1), high rate capability (with a reversible capacity of approximately 605 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1), and excellent cyclic stability (with a capacity of over 900 mAh g-1 during 500 cycles). The superior electrochemical performance of α-Fe2O3 nanosheets is attributed to the pseudocapacitive behavior, Al-doping in the α-Fe2O3 structure, and improved Li+-transfer property across the (001) facet, as elucidated by first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. These results reveal the underlying mechanism of Li+ transfer across different facets and thus provide insights into the understanding of the excellent electrochemical performance.",

However, SGT anodes present issues regarding rate performance and cycle stability due to the anisotropy structure and the instability of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI). In this work, a composite anode with isotropic structure was prepared by granulation of high-sulfur coal (HSC) and SGT, while an artificial SEI was prepared utilizing polyether amine/polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PEA/PVP) crosslinked polymer. Results showed that the coke from HSC pyrolysis enhanced the isotropy of the composite anode and improved its rate performance. Compared with SGT, the capacity retention rate of the sample (OSGT-50%OHSC) after oxidation - pyrolysis at a high current density of 5.0 A g-1 increased from 7.2% to 25.8%. Additionally, the PEA/PVP artificial SEI strengthened the cycle stability of the anode. After 1000 cycles, the capacity retention rate increased from 22.5% to 70.3%.

        "abstract": "In this work, we report the synthesis of hydrated and non-crystalline WO3 flakes (WO3−x) via an environmentally friendly and facile water-based strategy. This method is described, in the literature, as exfoliation, however, based on the results obtained, we cannot say unequivocally that we have obtained an exfoliated material. Nevertheless, the proposed modification procedure clearly affects the morphology of WO3 and leads to loss of crystallinity of the material. TEM techniques confirmed that the process leads to the formation of WO3 flakes of a few nanometers in thickness. X-ray diffractograms affirmed the poor crystallinity of the flakes, while spectroscopic methods showed that the materials after exfoliation were abundant with the surface groups. The thin film of hydrated and non-crystalline WO3 exhibits a seven times higher specific capacitance (Cs) in an aqueous electrolyte than bulk WO3 and shows an outstanding long-term cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 92% after 1000 chronopotentiometric cycles in the three-electrode system. In the two-electrode system, hydrated WO3−x shows a Cs of 122 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. The developed supercapacitor shows an energy density of 60 Whkg−1 and power density of 803 Wkg−1 with a decrease of 16% in Csp after 10,000 cycles. On the other hand, WO3−x is characterized by inferior properties as an anode material in lithium-ion batteries compared to bulk WO3. Lithium ions intercalate into a WO3 crystal framework and occupy trigonal cavity sites during the electrochemical polarization. If there is no regular layer structure, as in the case of the hydrated and non-crystalline WO3, the insertion of lithium ions between WO3 layers is not possible. Thus, in the case of a non-aqueous electrolyte, the specific capacity of the hydrated and non-crystalline WO3 electrode material is much lower in comparison with the specific capacity of the bulk WO3-based anode material.",

Our results indicate that the alternating nanoscaled lamella structure is a good alternative to facilitate the transfer of both the Li ions and electrons into the spinel LTO, giving rise to an excellent cyclability and fast rate performance. Therefore, the newly prepared carbon-free LTO-RT nanosheets with high safety provide a new opportunity to develop high-power anodes for LIBs.",

        "abstract": "The key hurdle to the practical application of polymeric electrolytes in high‐energy‐density solid lithium‐metal batteries is the sluggish Li+ mobility and inferior electrode/electrolyte interfacial stability. Herein, a dynamic supramolecular polymer electrolyte (SH‐SPE) with loosely coordinating structure is synthesized based on poly(hexafluoroisopropyl methacrylate‐co‐N‐methylmethacrylamide) (PHFNMA) and single‐ion lithiated polyvinyl formal. The weak anti‐cooperative H‐bonds between the two polymers endow SH‐SPE with a self‐healing ability and improved toughness. Meanwhile, the good flexibility and widened energy gap of PHFNMA enable SH‐SPE with efficient ion transport and superior interfacial stability in high‐voltage battery systems. As a result, the as‐prepared SH‐SPE exhibits an ionic conductivity of 2.30 × 10−4 S cm−1, lithium‐ion transference number of 0.74, electrochemical stability window beyond 4.8 V, and tensile strength up to 11.9 MPa as well as excellent adaptability with volume change of the electrodes. In addition, no major electrolyte decomposition inside batteries made from SH‐SPE and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathode can be observed in the in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry test. This study provides a new methodology for the macromolecular design of polymer electrolytes to address the interfacial issues in high‐voltage solid batteries.",

Fourier transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron measurements indicate that the TA is coated successfully on the PP separators. Scanning electron microscopy images show that the TA coating does not destroy the microporous structure of the separators. After being coated with TA, the PP separators become more hydrophilic, which not only enhances the liquid electrolyte retention ability but also increases the ionic conductivity. The battery performance, especially for power capability, is improved after being coated with TA.

        "abstract": "The ageing phenomena occurring in various diethyl carbonate/LiPF6 solutions are studied using gamma and pulse radiolysis as a tool to generate similar species as the ones occurring in electrolysis of Li-ion batteries (LIBs). According to picosecond pulse radiolysis experiments, the reaction of the electron with (Li(+), PF6(-)) is ultrafast, leading to the formation of fluoride anions that can then precipitate into LiF(s). Moreover, direct radiation-matter interaction with the salt produces reactive fluorine atoms forming HF(g) and C2H5F(g). The strong Lewis acid PF5 is also formed. This species then forms various R(1)R(2)R(3) P=O molecules, where R is mainly -F, -OH, and -OC2H5. Substitution reactions take place and oligomers are slowly formed. Similar results were obtained in the ageing of an electrochemical cell filled with the same model solution. This study demonstrates that radiolysis enables a description of the reactivity in LIBs from the picosecond timescale until a few days.",

        "abstract": "Ni-rich layered oxides have been intensively considered as promising cathode materials for next-generation Li-ion batteries. Nevertheless, the performance degradation caused by intergranular cracks and electrode/electrolyte interface parasitic reactions restricts their further application. Compared with secondary particles, single-crystal (SC) materials have better mechanical integrity and cycling stability. However, the preparation of ultrahigh-nickel layered SC cathode still remains a serious challenge. Herein, a novel LiOH-LiNO3 -H3 BO3 molten-salt method is proposed to synthesize SC LiNi0.92 Co0.06 Mn0.02 O2 with considerable crystallinity and uniformity. The critical impacts of calcination temperature and boric acid on the microstructure and electrochemical property of Ni-rich layered oxides are systematically investigated. The results show that the crystal growth is promoted and the stability of crystal structure is improved by this synthesis method. In particular, the optimal electrode demonstrates a superior initial discharge capacity of 214.8 mAh g-1 with a high capacity retention of 86.3% over 300 cycles as tested by pouch-type full cells at 45 ºC. This work not only prepares an ultrahigh-nickel layered CS cathode with superior electrochemical performances, but also provides a feasible method for the synthesis of other CS layered cathode materials.",

Here, we design a silicon nanocone-carbon (SNC-C) composite structure as a model anode to demonstrate the significant influences of carbon coating on SEI formation and electrochemical performance, unaffectedly as a result of pure electrode component and distinctly due to regular nanocone morphology. As demonstrated by morphological and elemental analysis, compared to the SNC electrode, the SNC-C electrode maintains a thinner SEI layer (∼10 nm) and more stable structure during cycling as well as longer cycle life (>725 cycles), higher Coulombic efficiency (>99%), and lower electrode polarization. This well-defined structure clearly shows the interface stability attributed to carbon coating and is promising in fundamental research of the silicon anode.",

        "abstract": "Lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) show promise to help lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) in giving response to those applications that require an energy storage solution. However, pre-lithiation is a major challenge that needs to be tackled in order to develop efficient and long-lasting LIBs and LICs. In this work, we report for the first time the scale-up and utilization of sacrificial salts (dilithium squarate, Li2C4O4) as a pre-lithiation strategy in a LIC prototype fabricated in a pilot line. The synthesis of the sacrificial salt is scaled-up to produce 1 kg and is later incorporated in the positive electrode during the slurry formulation. After in-depth process optimization, 12 meter of a double side electrode are fabricated, achieving a high mass loading of 5.5 mg cm−2 for the HC negative electrode, and 14 mg cm−2 for the positive electrode accounting both the activated carbon and the dilithium squarate. On account of the satisfactory mechanical and electrochemical behaviour of the electrodes, multilayer pouch cell LIC prototypes are fabricated reaching 80 F each. Pre-lithiation is completed during the first ten cycles and after the required gas exhaustion, electrochemical performance of prototypes is also satisfactory. Moreover, fabricated pouch cells overcome a float test of 1600 h at 50 °C showing a capacitance retention of 84.3%. These results give clear evidence for the potential use of this strategy in real products and can foster research in the field to promote pre-lithiation by means of sacrificial salts as the final solution to the pre-lithiation step, both for LIBs and LICs.",

From the interface chemistry point of view, a system-level strategy of designing polydopamine coated reduced graphene oxide/sulfur composite cathodes aimed at enhancing cyclic performance was reported in this work. As a soft buffer layer, the polydopamine shell was used to accommodate the volume expansion of S and avoid the leakage of polysulfide during cycling. A cross-link reaction between polydopamine buffer and poly(acrylic acid) binder was further designed to improve the strength of the entire electrode. As a result, the electrode demonstrated excellent cyclic performance with a discharge capacity of 728 mAh/g after 500 cycles at the current density of 0.5 A/g (a very small capacity loss of 0.41 mAh/g per cycle). Most importantly, 530 mAh/g was obtained even at a higher current density of 1 A/g after 800 cycles. Our results indicate the importance of chemically designing interfaces in the whole electrode system on achieving improved performance of electrodes of rechargeable lithium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "In lithium ion batteries (LIBs), the layered cathode materials of composition LiNi1- x - y Cox Mny O2  are critical for achieving high energy densities. A high nickel content (>80%) provides an attractive balance between high energy density, long lifetime, and low cost. Consequently, Ni-rich layered oxides cathode active materials (CAMs) are in high demand, and the importance of LiNiO2 (LNO) as limiting case, is hence paramount. However, achieving perfect stoichiometry is a challenge resulting in various structural issues, which successively impact physicochemical properties and result in the capacity fade of LIBs. To better understand defect formation in LNO, the role of the Ni(OH)2  precursor morphology in the synthesis of LNO requires in-depth investigation. By employing aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and precession electron diffraction, a direct observation of defects in the Ni(OH)2  precursor preparedis reported and the ex situ structural evolution from the precursor to the end product is monitored. During synthesis, the layered Ni(OH)2  structure transforms to partially lithiated (non-layered) NiO and finally to layered LNO. The results suggest that the defects observed in commercially relevant CAMs originate to a large extent from the precursors, hence care must be taken in tuning the co-precipitation parameters to synthesize defect-free Ni-rich layered oxides CAMs.",

However, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the structure and properties of the individual SEI components.

Herein, we present the transformational effects of their amorphous phase on the mechanical and transport characteristics, based on first-principles calculations. Our studies clearly demonstrate that their amorphous phases exhibit significantly improved Li-ion conductivity when compared to the crystalline structures. Additionally, among them, amorphous LiF emerges as a frontrunner for fast Li+ ion transportation, reversing the conventionally understood hierarchy. Under ambient conditions, the amorphous phases of LiF, Li2O, and Li2CO3 are thermodynamically unstable and tend to undergo recrystallization. However, this work highlights that exceptionally ductile and resilient amorphous phases can form if SEI formation and growth would involve some admixing of lithiophilic impurities like nitrogen (N) within the host matrices.",

Advanced Materials, 35 (2023) 2210111). The honeycomb-structured organic layer increases the wetting of electrolyte due to the large surface area, leading to a thin solid electrolyte interface (SEI). While the BF3-doped monolayer MXene provides abundant active sites for lithium homogeneous nucleation and growth, resulting in about 50% reduced thickness of inorganic-rich components among the SEI layer. A low overpotential of less than 30 mV over 1000 h cycling in symmetric cells was received. The functional BF3 groups along with the excellent electronic conductivity and smooth surface of the MXene greatly reduce the lithium plating/stripping energy barrier, enabling a dendrite-free lithium metal anode. The battery paired with NMC811 exhibited a high initial Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 82.1%. A high capacity-retention of 175.4 mAh/g at 1.0 C was achieved after 350 cycles. After long 500 cycles, a reliable capacity was still remained while the cell with un-modified Li metal quickly dropped to below 74.2 mAh/g. In a pouch cell with a capacity of 475 mAh, the battery still exhibited a high discharge capacity of 165.6 mAh/g with a capacity retention of 90.2% after 200 cycles, while the cell with pure Li metal decreased to 80.5%.\n \n Keywords: Lithium metal electrode; Lithium ion battery; MXene; Doping",

By constructing vertical alignment of Li0.35La0.55TiO3 nanowires (LLTO NWs) in solid‐state cathode through magnetic manipulation, the ionic conductivity of the cathode increases twice compared with the cathode consisted of randomly distributed LLTO NWs.

        "abstract": "The nickel-rich cathode LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) possesses the advantages of high reversible specific capacity and low cost, thus regarded as a promising cathode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, the capacity of the NCM811 decays rapidly at high voltage due to the extremely unstable electrode/electrolyte interphase. The discharge capability at low temperature is also impaired because of the increasing interfacial impedance. Herein, a low-cost film-forming electrolyte additive with multi-function, phenylboronic acid (PBA), is employed to modify the interphasial properties of the NCM811 cathode. Theoretical calculation and experimental results show that PBA constructs a highly conductive and steady cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) film via preferential oxidation decomposition, which greatly improves the interfacial properties of the NCM811 cathode at room (25 ℃) and low temperature (-10 ℃). Specifically, the capacity retention of NCM811/Li cell is increased from 68% to 87% after 200 cycles with PBA additive. Moreover, the NCM811/Li cell with PBA additive delivers higher discharge capacity under -10 ℃ at 0.5C (173.7 mAh/g vs. 111.1 mAh/g). Based on the improvement of NCM811 interphasial properties by additive PBA, the capacity retention of NCM811/graphite full-cell is enhanced from 49% to 65% after 200 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Nickel–manganese–cobalt oxides, with LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 (NMC) as the most prominent compound, are state-of-the-art cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles. The growing market for electro mobility has led to a growing global demand for Li, Co, Ni, and Mn, making spent lithium-ion batteries a valuable secondary resource. Going forward, energy- and resource-inefficient pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical recycling strategies must be avoided. We presented an approach to recover NMC particles from spent lithium-ion battery cathodes while preserving their chemical and morphological properties, with a minimal use of chemicals. The key task was the separation of the cathode coating layer consisting of NMC, an organic binder, and carbon black, from the Al substrate foil. This can be performed in water under strong agitation to support the slow detachment process. However, the contact of the NMC cathode with water leads to a release of Li+ ions and a fast increase in the pH. Unwanted side reactions may occur as the Al substrate foil starts to dissolve and Al(OH)3 precipitates on the NMC. These side reactions are avoided using pH-adjusted solutions with sufficiently high buffer capacities to separate the coating layer from the Al substrate, without precipitations and without degradation of the NMC particles.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The all‐solid‐state battery (ASSB) is a promising candidate for electrochemical energy storage. In view of the limited availability of lithium, however, alternative systems based on earth‐abundant and inexpensive elements are urgently sought. Besides well‐studied sodium compounds, potassium‐based systems offer the advantage of low cost and a large electrochemical window, but are hardly explored. Here we report the synthesis and crystal structure of K‐ion conducting T5 KSi2P3 inspired by recent discoveries of fast ion conductors in alkaline phosphidosilicates. KSi2P3 is composed of SiP4 tetrahedra forming interpenetrating networks of large T5 supertetrahedra. The compound passes through a reconstructive phase transition from the known T3 to the new tetragonal T5 polymorph at 1020 °C with enantiotropic displacive phase transitions upon cooling at about 155 °C and 80 °C. The potassium ions are located in large channels between the T5 supertetrahedral networks and show facile movement through the structure. The bulk ionic conductivity is up to 2.6×10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C with an average activation energy of 0.20 eV. This is remarkably high for a potassium ion conductor at room temperature, and marks KSi2P3 as the first non‐oxide solid potassium ion conductor.",

        "title": "(Invited) Pragmatic Approach and Challenges of All Solid State Batteries: Hybrid Solid Electrolyte for Technical Innovation",
        "abstract": "For the growth of electric vehicle market, lithium-ion batteries (LIBS) used in the EVs still requires safety and reliability. Unfortunately, large-scale application of the LIBs is being challenged due to the fact that the use of flammable liquid electrolytes has caused safety issues such as leakage and fire explosion. In this respect, all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) have been intensively studied to ensure the safety and mileage that are superior to the current LIBs. In terms of solid electrolytes, oxide electrolytes not only shows high ionic conductivity (10-4 ~ 10-3 S/cm) but also high mechanical strength to suppress surface dendrite formation. In addition, the oxide electrolytes possess advantages such as non-flammability, high thermal stability, and excellent electrochemical stability (~ 6 V), enabling high temperature/high voltage operations of oxide-based ASSBs. However, most of oxide materials require a sintering process at high temperatures to form a planar solid electrolyte. And a lack of flexibility results in non-uniform electrolyte/electrode contact in the battery, which makes it difficult to apply the rigid oxide electrolyte directly. On the other hand, solid polymer electrolytes have also been actively investigated due to no leakage, good electrolyte/electrode contact, easy processing, flexibility, and good film formability. However, the solid polymer electrolytes have critical disadvantages such as low ionic conductivity at room temperature and low thermal/mechanical stability, which precludes commercialization of solid polymer-based ASSBs despite their advantages. To overcome each disadvantages of oxide and polymer electrolytes, we developed hybrid electrolytes for improved ionic conductivity, easy processing, and formation of continuous electrolyte/electrode interface. In this presentation, pragmatic approach and current challenges related to solid batteries will be discussed including innovative manufacturing process. Hybrid electrolytes and their synergistic effect on the battery performance as a promissing solution will be presented [Fig. 1]\n",

        "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) current collectors can effectively mitigate the volumetric expansion of working lithium metal anodes (LMAs). However, the practical utilization of 3D current collectors for lithium metal batteries remains unsatisfactory because of inhomogeneous deposition of lithium ions and an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, a facile method based on the exchange reaction between Li and AgNO3 is exploited to embed Ag nanoparticles (NPs) and LiNO3 in a carbon paper (ALCP@Li). The Ag NPs act as a seed for even lithium deposition inside the carbon matrix by virtue of their excellent lithiophilicity. Simultaneously, LiNO3 plays an effective role in stabilizing LMAs by evolving a robust N-rich SEI. As a result, such 3D LMAs show a high Coulombic efficiency in half-cells (200 cycles, 99% at 1 mA cm-2, 1 mAh cm-2) and a low overpotential (60 mV). When paired with commercial thick NCM622 and LiFePO4 cathodes, the 3D LMA-based full cells exhibit stable cycling in carbonate electrolytes.",

The assemblies exhibit outstanding electrochemical performances: superior rate capability, high volumetric energy density, and especially ultralong high-rate cyclability, due to the superiority of unique hierarchical structures. The polyhedrons with exposed active crystal facets provide more channels for Li+ diffusion, and meso/macropores serve as access shortcuts for fast migration of electrolytes, Li+ and electrons.

In order to prognosis the SOH of LIBs, this paper proposed a Transformer based deep domain adaptation methodology (TDDAM). This paper applies the transformer model, which is widely used in natural language processing and other fields, to the prediction of LIBs. Meanwhile in order to solve the problem of model matching in different types of batteries or different environments, this paper combines domain adaptation method based on the maximum mean discrepancy. Firstly, we extract the data features of LIBs through position encoding and processing of the encoder structure with the multi-head self-attention mechanism as the core. Then, based on the maximum mean discrepancy index, the target domain data and the source domain data features are aligned, and the decoder part of the original transformer model is replaced with a fully connected layer for the prediction of SOH of LIBs in the target domain. This is the first time that a Transformer has been combined with the maximum mean discrepancy to be applied to LIBs prediction. Comprehensive experiments on two CALCE LIBs data showed that the TDDAM achieved smaller prognostic prediction errors over popular SOH diagnostic methods, indicating its great potential as a generic backbone for LIBs prognosis.",

In order to improve the electrochemical performances of TiO2 nanomaterials as anode for LIB, hierarchically porous TiO2 nanofibers with different tetrabutyl titanate (TBT)/paraffin oil ratios were prepared as anode for LIB via a versatile single-nozzle microemulsion electrospinning (ME-ES) method followed by calcining.

Furthermore, they presented superior lithium-ion storage properties in terms of specific capacity, rate capability and cycling performance compared with solid TiO2 nanofibers for LIB. The initial discharge and charge capacity of porous TiO2 nanofibers with a TBT/paraffin oil ratio of 2.25 reached up to 634.72 and 390.42 mAh·g−1, thus resulting in a coulombic efficiency of 61.51%; and the discharge capacity maintained 264.56 mAh·g−1 after 100 cycles, which was much higher than that of solid TiO2 nanofibers.

Since the local structural arrangement is crucial for battery application, we aim to monitor its evolution upon the synthesis of Li2MnO2F from two sets of precursors: Mn2O3, Li2O, and LiF or LiMnO2 and LiF. The synthesis progress was thus followed, by 7Li and 19F MAS NMR coupled to XRD to probe the structure at different scales. This allowed us to identify an optimal milling time to reach the final compounds. We show that they exhibit similar morphology (by SEM), medium- and short-range orders (by XRD, 7Li and 19F NMR, EXAFS), and average Mn oxidation degree (by XANES).

        "title": "Water-solid surface contact electrification and its use for harvesting liquid-wave energy.",
        "abstract": "Contact electrification, also called triboelectrification, is an old but well-known phenomenon in which surface charge transfer occurs when two materials are brought into contact. Although some of the fundamental mechanisms about triboelectrification are still under discussion, such as what subjects (electrons, ions, or small amounts of material) are transferred during the contact and separation process to produce the charged surface, and why surface charge transfer occurs even between identical materials, triboelectrification does exist and it has some practical applications together with many negative consequences. Recently, contact electrification has been demonstrated for some potential applications, such as energy harvesting, chemical sensors, 6] electrostatic charge patterning, metal-ion reduction, and laser printing. The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), which is the first invention utilizing contact electrification to efficiently convert mechanical energy into electricity, has been systematically studied to instantaneously drive hundreds of lightemitting diodes (LEDs) and charge a lithium-ion battery for powering a wireless sensor and a commercial cell phone. Recently, the research has been broadened to collect energy from environment, such as wind and human motion, under which the TENG works in relatively dry conditions, because the surface triboelectrification would be greatly decreased if not totally eliminated by the presence of water. However, water vapor and liquid water are abundant and the most obvious example is ocean waves and tides that have huge amounts of mechanical energy, which is inexhaustible and not largely dictated by daytime, season, weather and climate, in contrast to solar energy. Until now, TENG is designed to work between solid materials and works best under dry conditions. 13–16] However, tribolelectricity does exist when liquids are flowing through insulating tubes. For example, a voltage variation rising up to 300 mV is observed when deionized water flows through a 1 m-long rubber tube. Or a surface charge density of 4.5 mC m 2 is measured on each water droplet pipetted from a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tip. Therefore, herein we explore the opportunity to use water contact as one type of “material” choice for TENG. We demonstrate that the contact electrification between water and insulating polymer films can also be useful for TENG, which can derive a new application of TENG especially in liquid environments for sensing. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and PTFE are chosen in this study for their hydrophobic properties and high negativity in the triboelectric series. To further investigate this effect, TENGs using tap water, deionized water, and deionized water with a high concentration of NaCl are also compared. Under periodic contacting deionized water by a linear motor, PDMS film with patterned pyramid array can provide an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 52 V and short-circuit current density (Jsc) exceeding 2.45 mAm 2 with a peak power density of nearly 0.13 W m , which is large enough to light up 60 commercial LEDs. The incubation shaker and platform rocker are used to stimulate different wave motions in the environment and the water–TENG successfully harvests these types of mechanical energy into electricity. Moreover, the water–TENG also has the capability to act as a chemical and temperature sensor. Figure 1 shows the fabrication process of the TENG and how the water contact electrification is included in the action unit. The TENG fabrication starts from the design of a PDMS film with patterned pyramid array (Figure 1a). The Si wafer mold was made by photolithography and then etched by a dry etching process. Liquid PDMS elastomer and cross-linker were mixed, degassed, and uniformly spin-coated on the Si wafer mold. After thermal incubation, a uniform PDMS film with a patterned pyramid array was formed. For the other part of the construct, thin films of Cu (100 nm) were deposited on two poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) substrates by a RF magnetron sputtering deposition system. PMMA is selected as the substrate material because it provides a flat surface, light weight, and high strength. The PDMS film with the pyramid array pattern was peeled off the Si wafer mold and then placed on one of the Cu thin-film-deposited PMMA substrates with uncured PDMS mixture on top. Finally, the structure was incubated again to obtain a fully developed device for use in the next step. To investigate the contact electrification between water and the PDMS film, the second Cu thin-film-deposited PMMA substrate was placed on the bottom of an insulating tank (Figure 1b), acting as the conducting electrode for the water. The dimensions of the tank were 11 cm 7 cm. After the tank was filled with water, the device consisting of the [*] Dr. Z.-H. Lin, Dr. G. Cheng, L. Lin, Dr. S. Lee, Prof. Z. L.

        "title": "Sustainable Production of Biomass-Derived Graphite and Graphene Conductive Inks from Biochar.",
        "abstract": "Graphite is a commonly used raw material across many industries and the demand for high-quality graphite has been increasing in recent years, especially as a primary component for lithium-ion batteries. However, graphite production is currently limited by production shortages, uneven geographical distribution, and significant environmental impacts incurred from conventional processing. Here, an efficient method of synthesizing biomass-derived graphite from biochar is presented as a sustainable alternative to natural and synthetic graphite. The resulting bio-graphite equals or exceeds quantitative quality metrics of spheroidized natural graphite, achieving a Raman ID/IG ratio of 0.051 and crystallite size parallel to the graphene layers (La) of 2.08 µm. This bio-graphite is directly applied as a raw input to liquid-phase exfoliation of graphene for the scalable production of conductive inks. The spin-coated films from the bio-graphene ink exhibit the highest conductivity among all biomass-derived graphene or carbon materials, reaching 3.58 ± 0.16 × 104 S m-1. Life cycle assessment demonstrates that this bio-graphite requires less fossil fuel and produces reduced greenhouse gas emissions compared to incumbent methods for natural, synthesized, and other bio-derived graphitic materials. This work thus offers a sustainable, locally adaptable solution for producing state-of-the-art graphite that is suitable for bio-graphene and other high-value products.",

        "title": "Enabling Ultrastable Co-Free Li-Rich Oxides via TbF3 Treatment.",
        "abstract": "Co-free Li-rich Mn-based cathode materials (Co-free LRMOs) have become one of the most promising cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries for the next generation due to their low cost, high capacity, and environmental friendliness. Under high voltage, redox reactions involving anions can easily lead to various issues, including oxygen release, dissolution of transition metal elements (TMs), and structural collapse in these materials. The absence of the Co element further exacerbates this issue. Here, a simple one-step solid-phase reaction strategy is proposed to achieve nanoscale dual modification of the Co-free LRMOs with F and Tb doping. The dual modification has a relatively small impact on the cell parameters and Li+ diffusion ability of the LRMOs, leading to no significant improvement in its rate performance. The modified LRMOs only exhibited discharge capacities of 220.7, 200.1, 140.0, 115.5, and 90.9 mAh·g-1 at 0.1, 0.2, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 C, respectively. However, the modified Co-free LRMOs exhibit extremely strong structural stability and retain 95.1% of the initial capacity after 300 cycles, so far, the highest capacity retention rates among all Ni/Mn-based Li-rich materials. Mechanism studies have shown that the enhancement in structural stability of the Co-free LRMOs is attributed to the increased concentration of oxygen vacancies and Ni3+ ions through F doping. Furthermore, Tb doping not only hinders the release of O2 but also enhances the Li+ migration and electronic conductivity coefficient of the LRMOs.",

        "abstract": "Lithium sulfur (Li-S) battery is considered as a promising alternative for the development of battery technologies. However, the shuttle effect seriously limits its practical use. Herein, hollow tubular graphene-like carbon nitride (Tg-C3N4) is synthesized and utilized as a functional interlayer to inhibit shuttling effect and promote catalytic kinetics. Both experiments and DFT calculations together suggest that N-doping enhances the electron transfers between Tg-C3N4 and LiPSs, leading to improved chemical adsorptions and catalytic effects towards the redox conversions of the active sulfur species. Besides, Tg-C3N4 delivers a unique hollow tubular architecture with massive ion transfer pathways and fully exposed active interfaces. In addition, the abundant C–N heteroatomic structures also impose strong chemical immobilization toward lithium polysulfides. Benefiting from these unique superiorities, the cell with the Tg-C3N4-modified separator exhibits a reversible capacity of 494 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 1 C with a negligible capacity decay of 0.085% per cycle, indicating an efficient strategy toward high-performance modified separators.",

        "abstract": "Magnesium-ion batteries (MIBs) have been pushed into the research boom in the post-lithium-ion batteries era due to their low cost, no dendrite hazard, and high capacity. However, finding suitable cathode materials to improve the slow kinetics of Mg2+ is an ongoing challenge. In this work, Ba0.18V2O4.95/NH4V4O10 film electrodes were grown in one step on indium tin oxide (ITO) conductive glass using a low-temperature liquid-phase deposition method. Temperature was used as the probe condition, and it was concluded that the films annealed at 400 °C had suitable crystallinity and de-ammonium lattice space. At lower current density, with 0.5 M Mg(ClO4)2/PC as the electrolyte, it exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 130.99 mA h m-2 at 210 mA m-2 and 106.52% capacity retention after 100 cycles. In addition, it exhibited excellent electrochemical performance in long-term cycling (92.98% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 600 mA m-2). According to the results of ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), the removal of NH4+ created more lattice space, assisting Ba0.18V2O4.95 to increase the transfer channels of Mg2+, providing more active sites to promote diffusion kinetics (the average DMg2+ was 2.07 × 10-12 cm2 s-1) and specific capacity. Therefore, these film electrodes for scalable Mg2+ storage are promising MIB cathode candidates that exhibit good performance advantages in storage applications.",

It can be described as a VO6 octahedron sharing corners with six PO4 tetrahedra to form a 3D framework. One oxygen atom of each phosphate group is unshared with a vanadium octahedron and as such linked to a hydrogen atom. The arrangement of these polyhedra generates large channels running along [100] in which lithium cations are located.

The ReS2@CB nanocomposite showed high specific capacities of 760, 667, 600, 525, and 473 mAh/g at the current densities of 0.1 (0.23 C), 0.2 (0.46 C), 0.3 (0.7 C), 0.5 (1.15 C) and 1.0 A/g (2.3 C), respectively, in conjunction with its excellent cycling performance (432 mAh/g at 2.3 C; 91.4% capacity retention) after 100 cycles. Such LIB performance is greatly higher than pure CB and ReS2 powder samples. These results could be due to the following reasons: (1) the low-cost CB serves as a supporter enabling the formation of ≈1–4 layered nanosheets of ReS2, thus avoiding its agglomeration; (2) the CB enhances the electrical conductivity of the ReS2@CB nanocomposite; (3) the ultra-thin (1–4 layers) ReS2 nanosheets with imperfect structure can function as increasing the number of active sites for reaction of Li+ ions with electrolytes.

The real cell showed satisfactory values of both the initial specific capacity (100 mAh g-1) and the capacity retention after 100 cycles. These results are comparable to and in some cases even better than those of cells that use commercial graphite and conventional Li sources as primary raw materials.

To address this issue, this work proposes a hybrid model consisting of a Transformer neural network and a single particle model with electrolyte dynamics (SPMe) for SOC estimation in limited data scenarios. The Transformer can leverage the internal battery states estimated by the SPMe when necessary and learn to use information from multiple sources (i.e., experimental data and SPMe). Two limited data scenarios, partially available cycles and varying temperatures, are evaluated with experimental battery discharge cycles to identify the conditions under which the proposed model outperforms traditional ML models. Despite being highly dependent on the SPMe's performance, the hybrid model demonstrated improved SOC estimation over the baseline models, with less than 2% error for most scenarios.",

The corrosion potential of the cell hardware is predominantly controlled by the iron component of the cylindrical can which cathodically protects the Ni coating. Despite the presence of cathodic protection, the Ni coating still experiences significant crevice corrosion, as confirmed through chemical aging tests. Mechanistic investigations on pure Ni metal reveal two distinct corrosion pathways depending on the presence or absence of oxygen in the electrolyte. The pathway involving oxygen proves to be more detrimental, as it oxidizes Ni in conjunction with acid, leading to the generation of water and the regeneration of corrosive species. This pathway exhibits corrosion rates two orders of magnitude higher than the alternative pathway. The dissolved Ni species predominantly exist in the +2 oxidation state and forms highly soluble F-rich compounds, comprising a mixture of associated species denoted by the formula Ni(PxOyFz)w. Finally, several suggestions for effectively mitigating Ni corrosion have been proposed, with alloying with chromium being the most effective.",

Most importantly, we found that MnO/C nanopeapods show no capacity fading even after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 2000 mA g(-1), and no morphology change. The present MnO/C nanopeapods are the most efficient MnO-based anode materials ever reported for LIBs.",

        "abstract": "Precise and rapid measurement for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is conducive to the working state monitoring and fault diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Although using a wideband signal can effectively reduce measurement time, it will deteriorate the measurement precision due to the insufficient signal-to-noise ratio. Considering this issue, this article proposes a wideband measurement approach using low-frequency concentrated disturbance for the EIS of LIBs. This approach can obtain high measurement accuracy and a wide measurement bandwidth under a small current disturbance. Besides, it effectively reduces the measurement time. First, LIBs are stimulated by a low-frequency concentrated binary sequence signal to enhance measurement precision in a low-frequency region. Then, in the entire frequency region, an accurate EIS can be obtained by a fast Morlet wavelet transform and covariance-based impedance calculation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on a buck-boost converter-based EIS measurement platform, and comparative analyses with literature methods are conducted. The experimental results illustrate that the maximum normalized root square error of the two types of LIBs at different state-of-charge is 0.37% under the response voltage amplitude of less than 10 mV. Moreover, this approach is approximately 20 times faster than commercial electrochemical workstations in measurement time.",

        "abstract": "For the development of safe and long-lasting lithium-ion batteries we need electrolytes with excellent ionic transport properties. Argyrodite-type Li6PS5X (X: Cl, Br, I) belongs to a family of such a class of materials offering ionic conductivities, at least if Li6PS5Br and Li6PS5Cl are considered, in the mS cm-1 range at room temperature. Although already tested as ceramic electrolytes in battery cells, a comprehensive picture about the ion dynamics is still missing. While Li6PS5Br and Li6PS5Cl show an exceptionally high Li ion conductivity, that of Li6PS5I with its polarizable I anions is by some orders of magnitude lower. This astonishing effect has not been satisfactorily understood so far. Studying the ion dynamics over a broad time and length scale is expected to help shed light on this aspect. Here, we used broadband impedance spectroscopy and 7Li NMR relaxation measurements and show that very fast local Li ion exchange processes are taking place in all three compounds. Most importantly, the diffusion-induced NMR spin-lattice relaxation in Li6PS5I is almost identical to that of its relatives. Considering the substitutional disorder effects in Li6PS5X (X = Br, Cl), we conclude that in structurally ordered Li6PS5I the important inter-cage jump processes are switched off, hindering the ions from taking part in long-range ion transport.",

The hot mineral acid acts simultaneously as a defunctionalizing and etching agent, removing a part of oxygen-containing groups and lattice carbon atoms from the layers. Annealing of the holey reduced GO at 800 °C–1000 °C causes a decrease of the content of residual oxygen and the interlayer spacing thus producing thin compact stacks from holey graphene layers. Electrochemical tests of the obtained materials in half-cells showed that the removal of oxygen and creation of basal holes lowers the capacity loss in the first cycle and facilitates intercalation-deintercalation of lithium ions. This was attributed to minimization of electrolyte decomposition reactions, easier desolvation of lithium ions near the hole boundaries and appearance of multiple entrances for the naked ions into graphene stacks.",

Using DAPbI as a cathode, an integrated photo-assisted LIB is realized, with a 0.2 V reduction in charge voltage, a 0.1 V increase in discharge voltage, enhancements of 7.4% in roundtrip efficiency and 0.5% in photoelectrochemical energy storage efficiency, and an 11.3% reduction in input power and an 18% increase in output power.

To solve above problems, conductive FeOOH interlayer is designed as an effective trapper and catalyst to accelerate the conversion of LiPSs in LSBs. FeOOH nanorod is effectively affinitive to S that Fe atoms act as Lewis acid sites to capture LiPSs via strong chemical anchoring capability and dispersion interaction. The excellent electrocatalytic effect enables that reduced charging potential barrier and enhanced electron/ion transport is realized on the FeOOH interlayer to promote LiPSs conversion. Significantly, Li2 S oxidation process is improved on the FeOOH interlayer determined as a combination of reduced Li2 S decomposition energy barrier and enhanced Li-ion transport. Therefore, the multifunctional FeOOH interlayer with conductive and catalytic features show strong chemisorption with LiPSs and accelerated LiPSs redox kinetics. As a result, LSBs with FeOOH interlayer displays high discharge capacity of 1449 mAh g-1 at 0.05 C and low capacity decay of 0.05% per cycle at 1 C, as well as excellent rate capability (449 mAh g-1 at 2 C).",

        "abstract": "In recent years, with the continuous growth in power demand, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have become an indispensable component of various electronic devices, transportation vehicles, and energy systems. The safety performance of LIBs is one of the most significant issues facing their continued development. In battery systems, the presence of arcs constitutes a significant safety hazard that necessitates attention; the thermal runaway (TR) of LIBs releases a large quantity of particles with elevated temperature and high velocity, probably resulting in arc failures. Changes in the insulation structure inside battery packs and the accumulation of particulate matter resulting from the TR of battery cells are potential causes of arc-induced disasters. In this study, we utilized fully charged 71 Ah ternary LIB Li (Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1) O2 (NCM811) pouch cell samples and collected the vented particles in an inert atmosphere after TR. All the settled particles were classified into six groups; by conducting experiments with different particle sizes, electrode spacings, and circuit loads, the patterns of the particle-induced arcs were understood. The results indicate that as the particle size increases, the critical breakdown voltage decreases. Regarding electrode spacing and circuit load resistance, larger values require higher critical breakdown voltages. The research results provide valuable guidance for the electrical protection and safety design of battery systems.",

        "abstract": "Aiming for specific energy improvements, lithium‐ion battery (LIB) research explores Si based materials as potential alternatives for the negative electrode/anode. Si exhibits a high specific capacity when lithiated, accompanied by a large volumetric expansion. To mitigate expansion induced failures, composite materials with finely distributed Si inside a scaffold have been established. Potential scaffolds to create such Si composites are nano porous SiO2 materials, such as MCM‐41. MCM‐41 exhibits a fine nanostructure, and the synthesis allows precise tuning of the pore properties and thus, after filling with Si, of Si morphology and Si content in the composite. In this work, insights into relevant MCM‐41 synthesis parameters are acquired, with special attention towards specific pore volumes and pore sizes of the SiO2 powders. Materials characterization is performed using nitrogen sorption analysis, X‐ray scattering, electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Selected MCM‐41 scaffolds are processed to Si composites and integrated into LIB electrodes. The specific capacity and the stability of the Si−SiO2 composites are evaluated by PITT and galvanostatic cycling. They show capacities above 800 mAh g−1, i. e. more than twice the specific capacity of industry standard graphite, and last over 200 charge/discharge cycles before their capacity loss exceeds 25 %.",

        "abstract": "Silicon (Si) is a promising anode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to its high specific capacity and abundance. However, challenges such as significant volume expansion during cycling and poor electrical conductivity hinder its large-scale application. In this study, the multifunction of sodium polyacrylate (PAAS) utilized to develop a hierarchical porous silicon-carbon anode (Si/SiOx@C) through a simple and efficient method. The hierarchical porous structure successively consists of nano-silicon cores, SiOx encapsulating layers, surrounding space, and phenolic resin-derived carbon shells with carbon chains connecting the SiOx layers and carbon shells in the space. The SiOx nanolayers promote Li⁺ transport, while excess PAAS, removed by washing, generates space for volume expansion, improving cycling performance. Residual carbon chains of PAAS and carbon shells form a conducting carbon network, enhancing electron transport and rate performance. As an anode for LIBs, the composite delivers a high reversible capacity of 685.3 mAh g⁻¹ after 1000 cycles at 1 C with a capacity retention rate of 54.7%. Full cells with the Si/SiOx@C anode and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode exhibit an excellent capacity retention rate of 96.8% after 200 cycles at 1 C. This work provides a novel approach for the rational design and engineering of advanced LIBs.",

Herein, we report a simple and scalable electrospinning method to synthesize porous CoTiO3 nanofibers as the precursor for nanostructured bimetallic transition-metal oxides formed electrochemically in situ. This strategy ensures uniform mixing and perfect contact between two constituent transition-metal oxides during the lithiation/delithiation process. Furthermore, CoTiO3 nanofibers based on ultrafine CoTiO3 nanocrystals are interconnected to form a nano/microstructured 3D network, which ensures the high stability of the in situ formed structure composed of bimetallic transition-metal oxides, and also fast ion/electron transfer and electrolyte penetration into the electrode. Electrochemical measurements revealed the excellent lithium storage (647 mAh g-1 at 0.1 Ag-1 ) and retention properties (600 mAh g-1 at 1 Ag-1 after 1200 cycles) of the CoO/TiO2 electrode. Moreover, the electrochemical reaction mechanism was explored by using ex situ X-ray photoelectric spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry tests, which confirmed the two-phase reaction processes in the electrodes.

        "title": "Fast charging of lithium-ion batteries at all temperatures",
        "abstract": "Significance Range anxiety is a key reason that consumers are reluctant to embrace electric vehicles (EVs). To be truly competitive with gasoline vehicles, EVs should allow drivers to recharge quickly anywhere in any weather, like refueling gasoline cars. However, none of today’s EVs allow fast charging in cold or even cool temperatures due to the risk of lithium plating, the formation of metallic lithium that drastically reduces battery life and even results in safety hazards. Here, we present an approach that enables 15-min fast charging of Li-ion batteries in any temperatures (even at −50 °C) while still preserving remarkable cycle life (4,500 cycles, equivalent to >12 y and >280,000 miles of EV lifetime), thus making EVs truly weather-independent. Fast charging is a key enabler of mainstream adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). None of today’s EVs can withstand fast charging in cold or even cool temperatures due to the risk of lithium plating. Efforts to enable fast charging are hampered by the trade-off nature of a lithium-ion battery: Improving low-temperature fast charging capability usually comes with sacrificing cell durability. Here, we present a controllable cell structure to break this trade-off and enable lithium plating-free (LPF) fast charging. Further, the LPF cell gives rise to a unified charging practice independent of ambient temperature, offering a platform for the development of battery materials without temperature restrictions. We demonstrate a 9.5 Ah 170 Wh/kg LPF cell that can be charged to 80% state of charge in 15 min even at −50 °C (beyond cell operation limit). Further, the LPF cell sustains 4,500 cycles of 3.5-C charging in 0 °C with <20% capacity loss, which is a 90× boost of life compared with a baseline conventional cell, and equivalent to >12 y and >280,000 miles of EV lifetime under this extreme usage condition, i.e., 3.5-C or 15-min fast charging at freezing temperatures.",

The development of new polymers is needed to further advance new applications or improve the performance of actual devices such as batteries, supercapacitors, or drug delivery systems. Here we show the synthesis and characterization of a new polymer which combines the present most successful conjugated polymer backbone and the most successful redox active side group, i.e., poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), and a nitroxide stable radical. First, a derivative of the 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) molecule with side nitroxide stable radical group (TEMPO) was synthesized. The electrochemical polymerization of the PEDOT-TEMPO monomer was investigated in detail using cyclic voltammetry, potential step, and constant current methods. Monomer and polymer were characterized by NMR, FTIR, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, elemental analysis, cyclic voltammetry, and four-point probe conductivity. The new PEDOT-TEMPO radical polymer combines the electronic conductivity of the conjugated polythiophene backbone and redox properties of the nitroxide group. As an example of application, this redox active polymer was used as a conductive binder in lithium ion batteries. Good cycling stability with high Coulombic efficiency and increased cyclability at different rates were obtained using this polymer as a replacement of two ingredients: conductive carbon additive and polymeric binders.",

Flexible polymer solid electrolytes have become the optimal solution to produce high energy density lithium batteries with arbitrary size and shape. In this work, we introduce a halide perovskite, CsSnI3, into the polyethylene oxide/lithium bis‐(trifluoromethanesuphone)imide (PEO–LiTFSI) polymer matrix. The CsSnI3 could form a LixSn alloy with Li, leading to homogenization of the electric field and Li+‐flux at the interface, Sn atom also bonds with the TFSI− anion to provide more dissociated Li+. Besides that, the I atom could interact with Li to form an electronic insulation with a strong blocking effect on electron tunneling. As a proof of concept, the synergy mechanism of the PEO–LiTFSI–CsSnI3 electrolyte improves the stable cycle life of the symmetric battery to more than 500 h, and the Li+ conductivity raised to 6.1 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 60°C.

As expected, the synergistic effects of the rigid cationic framework and flexible EO chains not only promote the dissociation of LiTFSI salts, but also greatly improve the transport of lithium ions, which endows LITFSI@EO-BIm-iCOF SSEs with a high Li+ conductivity of 1.08 × 10−4 S cm−1 and ionic transference number of 0.69 at room temperature. Besides, the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have also elucidated the diffusion and transport mechanism of lithium ions in LITFSI@EO-BIm-iCOF SSEs. Interestingly, the assembled SSLMBs wherein LiFePO4 is paired with LITFSI@EO-BIm-iCOF SSEs display decent electrochemical properties at higher and lower temperatures.

Therefore, the Li–S cell with the “two‐face” CGF Janus separator exhibit a high initial capacity of 1109 mAh g−1 and superior capacity preserved upon 800 mAh g−1 after 250 cycles at 0.2 C, which is 40% higher on sulfur utilization efficiency than the corresponding results with routine polypropylene separators. There are significant improvements on capacity as well as electrochemical kinetics. A very high areal capacity of 5.5 mAh cm−2 combined with high sulfur content of 80% and areal loading amount of 5.3 mg cm−2 is achieved for such advanced configuration. The negative impact of shuttle mechanism on lowering the utilization of sulfur and overall energy density of a Li–S battery is well eliminated by applying CGF separators. Consequently, employing carbonaceous materials as Janus face of separators enlightens new opportunities for improving the utilization of active materials and energy density of devices that involve complex phase evolution and conversion electrochemistry.",

        "title": "Morphology evolution of the aluminum surface in a fluorine-containing environment.",
        "abstract": "The interaction between aluminum (Al) and F and O atoms is essential to understand the etching process of Al and alumina (Al2O3) by fluorine-containing gases. In addition, it also has an influence on the corrosion behavior of Al devices, e.g., the Al collector in lithium-ion batteries operates in fluorine-containing electrolytes. However, the understanding of the structural evolution of the Al surface by fluorination at the atomistic level still remains elusive. Here, the thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors of F adatoms as well as co-adsorbed F and O adatoms on typical Al surfaces have been systematically investigated by combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations, canonical Monte Carlo (CMC) simulations and reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) simulations. The results of DFT calculations indicate that there is a repulsion (about 0.07 eV on Al(111) and Al(110), and 0.7 eV on Al(100)) between the first nearest neighboring (1NN) F adatoms, while an attraction of 0.14 eV on Al(111) exists within a 1NN F-O pair. CMC simulations reveal that the configurations of co-adsorbed F and O adatoms on the Al(111) surface at medium to low temperature (<600 K) and low total coverage (<0.2 monolayer, ML) have F adatoms dispersed in the hexagonal islands of O adatoms due to the attraction within the O-O and F-O pairs and the repulsion between F adatoms. As the coverage increases, the surface undergoes serious deformation. The average 1NN coordination numbers (1st CN) of O-to-O, F-to-O and F-to-F are six, three and zero, respectively. As the temperature increases, the interactions among adsorbates begin to be disrupted: the 1st CNs of O-to-O and F-to-O decrease, while that of F-to-F increases. The O-F hexagonal pattern remains until above the Al melting temperature (>1200 K). For F adatoms, both their migration on the surface and the penetration into the subsurface are easier than those of O adatoms, confirmed by both the DFT and RMD simulations. Our study on the co-adsorbates with opposite lateral interactions is instructive for understanding the thermal etching of Al and Al2O3 by fluorine-containing compounds.",

        "abstract": "The increasing demand for electrical energy storage makes it essential to explore alternative battery chemistries that overcome the energy-density limitations of the current state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries. In this scenario, lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) stand out due to the low cost, high theoretical capacity, and sustainability of sulfur. However, this battery technology presents several intrinsic limitations that need to be addressed in order to definitively achieve its commercialization. Herein, we report the fruitfulness of three different formulations using well-selected functional carbonaceous additives for sulfur cathode development, an in-house synthesized graphene-based porous carbon (ResFArGO), and a mixture of commercially available conductive carbons (CAs), as a facile and scalable strategy for the development of high-performing LSBs. The additives clearly improve the electrochemical properties of the sulfur electrodes due to an electronic conductivity enhancement, leading to an outstanding C-rate response with a remarkable capacity of 2 mA h cm–2 at 1C and superb capacities of 4.3, 4.0, and 3.6 mA h cm–2 at C/10 for ResFArGO10, ResFArGO5, and CAs, respectively. Moreover, in the case of ResFArGO, the presence of oxygen functional groups enables the development of compact high sulfur loading cathodes (>4 mgS cm–2) with a great ability to trap the soluble lithium polysulfides. Notably, the scalability of our system was further demonstrated by the assembly of prototype pouch cells delivering excellent capacities of 90 mA h (ResFArGO10 cell) and 70 mA h (ResFArGO5 and CAs cell) at C/10.",

        "abstract": "The drying process of lithium-ion battery electrodes is one of the key processes for manufacturing electrodes with high surface homogeneity and is one of the most energy-consuming stages. The choice of the drying parameters has a significant impact on the electrode properties and the production efficiency. In response to these issues, this study establishes the non-steady-state drying kinetic equation for the electrodes, revealing the comprehensive effects of various dominant factors on the drying process. The drying rate is closely related to the electrode surface temperature, thickness, and other factors. Furthermore, this study proposes a coupled model of hot air drying field and capillary porous electrode solvent evaporation. The results showed that approximately 90% of the solvent was removed in less than half of the drying time. Then, the mechanism and control factors of electrode solvent evaporation are analyzed. During the preheating phase, the drying rate is controlled by electrode heating and temperature rise. In the constant velocity phase, it is regulated by the heat transfer from the surface airflow, while in the deceleration phase, it is affected by the mass transfer from the electrodes. Additionally, the effects of different thicknesses, temperatures, and airflow speeds on the drying process were investigated. Finally, experimental verification demonstrated the optimal parameters within the scope of the study: a temperature of 363.15 K and airflow speeds of 2.3 m/s result in a higher drying rate, as well as favorable mechanical performance.",

The observability of the established battery model is analytically proven. This article also introduces an efficient parameter estimator based on extended-kernel iterative recursive least squares algorithm for real-time estimation of the parameters of the proposed Wiener model. The proposed approach is applied for state-of-charge (SoC) estimation of 3.4-Ah 3.6-V nickel-manganese-cobalt-based Li-ion cells using the extended Kalman filter (EKF). The results show about 1.5% improvement in SoC estimation accuracy compared with the EKF algorithm based on the second-order ECM.

The main problems plaguing Li-S batteries are poor cycle life and limited rate capability, caused by the insulating nature of S and the shuttle effect associated with the dissolution of intermediate lithium polysulfides. Here, we report the use of biocell-inspired polydopamine (PD) as a coating agent on both the cathode and separator to address these problems (the \"systematic effects\"). The PD-modified cathode and separator play key roles in facilitating ion diffusion and keeping the cathode structure stable, leading to uniform lithium deposition and a solid electrolyte interphase. As a result, an ultralong cycle performance of more than 3000 cycles, with a capacity fade of only 0.018% per cycle, was achieved at 2 C. It is believed that the systematic modification of the cathode and separator for Li-S batteries is a new strategy for practical applications.",

Here, we first revisit the phase stability and electrochemical performance of LiCoO2 synthesized at different temperatures using density functional theory calculations. Consistent with previous studies, we find that the occurrence of low- and high-temperature structures (i.e., cubic lithiated spinel LT-LiCoO2; or Li2Co2O4 ( Fd3̅ m) vs trigonal-layered HT-LiCoO2 ( R3̅ m), respectively) can be explained by a small difference in the free energy between these two compounds. Additionally, the observed voltage profile of a Li/LiCoO2 cell for both cubic and trigonal phases of LiCoO2, as well as the migration barrier for lithium diffusion from an octahedral (Oh) site to a tetrahedral site (Td) in Fd3̅ m LT-Li1- xCoO2, has been calculated to help understand the complex electrochemical charge/discharge processes. A search of LiCo xM1- xO2 lithiated spinel (M = Ni or Mn) structures and compositions is conducted to extend the exploration of the chemical space of Li-Co-Mn-Ni-O electrode materials.

Here, we address the issue by using a polyurethane (PU)-based electrolyte. The polar urethane/urea groups of PU reduce the hopping energy barrier of Li+, which results in high ionic conductivity of 1.8 × 10-4 S cm-1 (25 °C), high ion transference number of 0.54, and low activation energy of 0.39 eV. In addition, the polar urethane/urea groups endow the electrolyte with high adhesion, which allows the electrode/electrolyte interfaces to self-heal timely after being damaged during cycling. Benefiting from these merits, a symmetric Li||Li cell using the polyolefin-PU-bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt electrolyte can cycle for approximately 800 h with a stable overpotential (approximately 40 mV), and a solid-state Li-S battery using the electrolyte delivers a specific capacity of approximately 610 mAh g-1 after testing for 125 cycles at a S loading of about 4 mg cm-2. Self-healing of the electrode/electrolyte interfaces during cycling was observed in situ by a laser confocal microscope.

Herein, comprehensive theoretical study delivers new insights into the intrinsic laws of CoX2 : the relative vertical distance of two X atomic layers (rather than atom electronegativity) mainly controls adsorption; CoX2 mainly regulates the charging process (rather than discharging process) thus contributes to great cycling stability. On this basis, the advantages of CoTe2 are three-fold: moderate polysulfide adsorption, facile ion transport capacity, and surprisingly great promotion of charging process.

Here, we report the fabrication of rechargeable membrane-less Zn-anode batteries with high voltage properties (2.5 to 3.4 V) achieved through coupling cathodes and Zn-anodes in gelled concentrated acid and alkaline solutions separated by a gelled buffer interlayer containing the working ions. The concentrated gelled buffer interlayers perform dual functions of regulating the pH of the system and acting as the source and sink of the working ions. With this strategy we show low-cost membrane-less 2.5 to 3.4 V Zn-manganese dioxide (MnO2) batteries capable of cycling 10-100% of 617 mA h g-1-MnO2 and 20-30% of 820 mA h g-1-Zn and demonstrate their application in electric vehicles. This strategy is then applied to other oxide-based cathode systems like Cu2O and V2O5, where voltages of 2 to 3 V are obtained in membrane-less batteries.",

However, its theoretical capacity is only 372 mA h g−1. High-energy lithium-ion batteries have been a research hotspot.

Here, the Si/thermally reduced graphite oxide@carbon (Si/RGtO@C) composite was fabricated by electrostatic self-assembly followed by thermal treatment. The RGtO synergistic carbon coating layer can effectively compensate for the low electronic conductivity and buffer the volume expansion effect of the Si nanoparticles during charge/discharge cycles. The Si/RGtO@C anode demonstrated a significantly increased capacity compared to the RGtO. After 300 cycles, Si/RGtO@C kept a discharged capacity of 367.6 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 1.0 A g−1.

        "abstract": "Although transition metal phosphides anodes possess high theoretical capacities, their inferior electronic conductivities and drastic volume variations during cycling lead to poor rate capability and rapid capacity fading. To simultaneously overcome these issues, we report a hierarchical heterostructure consisting of isolated Mn2P nanoparticles embedded into nitrogen and phosphorus co-doped porous carbon nanosheets (denoted as Mn2P@NPC) as a viable anode for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The resulting Mn2P@NPC design manifests outstanding electrochemical performances, namely, high reversible capacity (774 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), exceptional rate capability (347 mAh g-1 at 4 A g-1) and excellent cycling stability (99 % capacity retention at 4A g-1 after 2000 cycles). The robust structure stability of Mn2P@NPC electrode during cycling has been revealed by the in-situ and ex-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterizations, giving rise to long-term cyclability. Using in-situ selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and ex-situ high-resolution TEM studies, we have unraveled the dominant lithium storage mechanism and confirmed that the superior lithium storage performance of Mn2P@NPC originated from the reversible conversion reaction. Furthermore, the Mn2P@NPC||LiFePO4 full cell exhibits impressive rate capability and cycling stability.

        "abstract": "Lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) is an irreplaceable cathode material for lithium‐ion batteries with high volumetric energy density. The prevailing O3 phase LiCoO2 adopts the ABCABC (A, B, and C stand for lattice sites in the close‐packed plane) stacking modes of close‐packed oxygen atoms. Currently, the focus of LiCoO2 development is application at high voltage (>4.55 V versus Li+/Li) to achieve a high specific capacity (>190 mAh g−1). However, cycled with a high cutoff voltage, O3–LiCoO2 suffers from rapid capacity decay. The causes of failure are mostly attributed to the irreversible transitions to H1‐3/O1 phase after deep delithiation and severe interfacial reactions with electrolytes. In addition to O3, LiCoO2 is also known to crystalize in an O2 phase with ABAC stacking. Since its discovery, little is known about the high‐voltage behavior of O2–LiCoO2. Herein, through systematic comparison between electrochemical performances of O3 and O2 LiCoO2 at high voltage, the significantly better stability of O2–LiCoO2 (>4.5 V) than that of O3–LiCoO2 in the same micro‐sized particle morphology is revealed. Combining various characterization techniques and multiscale simulation, the outstanding high‐voltage stability of O2–LiCoO2 is attributed to the high Li diffusivity and ideal mechanical properties. Uniform Li+ distribution and balanced internal stress loading may hold the key to improving the high‐voltage performance of LiCoO2.",

These superior electrode properties resulted from the unique feature of the amorphous-nanocrystalline mixture of tin oxides stored in the CNT tubes of this nanocomposite, because this structure accommodated the stress and confined the volume change of Li(+) insertion/desertion in Sn.

        "abstract": "The development of lithium-ion battery technology has ensured that battery thermal management systems are an essential component of the battery pack for next-generation energy storage systems. Using dielectric immersion cooling, researchers have demonstrated the ability to attain high heat transfer rates due to the direct contact between cells and the coolant. However, feedback control has not been widely applied to immersion cooling schemes. Furthermore, current research has not considered battery pack plant design when optimizing feedback control. Uncertainties are inherent in the cooling equipment, resulting in temperature and flow rate fluctuations. Hence, it is crucial to systematically consider these uncertainties during cooling system design to improve the performance and reliability of the battery pack. To fill this gap, we established a reliability-based control co-design optimization framework using machine learning for immersion cooled battery packs. We first developed an experimental setup for 21700 battery immersion cooling, and the experiment data were used to build a high-fidelity multiphysics finite element model. The model can precisely represent the electrical and thermal profile of the battery. We then developed surrogate models based on the finite element simulations in order to reduce computational cost. The reliability-based control co-design optimization was employed to find the best plant and control design for the cooling system, in which an outer optimization loop minimized the cooling system cost while an inner loop ensured battery pack reliability. Finally, an optimal cooling system design was obtained and validated, which showed a 90% saving in cooling system energy consumption.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge of the ion motion in room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) is critical for their applications in a number of fields, from lithium batteries to dye-sensitized solar cells. Experiments on a limited number of RTILs have shown that on macroscopic time scales the ions typically undergo conventional, Gaussian diffusion. On shorter time scales, however, non-Gaussian behavior has been observed, similar to supercooled fluids, concentrated colloidal suspensions, and more complex systems. Here we characterize the diffusive motion of ionic liquids based on the N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium (PYR14) cation and bis(trifluoro methanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI) or bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI) anions. A combination of pulsed gradient spin-echo (PGSE) NMR experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrates a crossover from subdiffusive behavior to conventional Gaussian diffusion at ∼10 ns. The deconvolution of molecular displacements into a continuous spectrum of diffusivities shows that the short-time behavior is related to the effects of molecular caging. For PYR14FSI, we identify the change of short-range ion-counterion associations as one possible mechanism triggering long-range displacements.",

However, the irreversible phase transformation and interfacial deterioration remain major impediments. Herein, using monoclinic Li3V2(PO4)3 as a model, the impact of excess lithium on its electrochemical properties are demonstrated. It was determined that a maximum of 5% excess lithium could be incorporated into the monoclinic structure, and a further overdose of lithium led to the formation of secondary phase Li3PO4. The excess Li+ ions are located at both octahedral and interstitial sites, which enable enhanced redox kinetics that are mainly attributed to accelerated ionic movement induced by alternate diffusion behavior of Li+ ions in a three-dimensional permeation path. Moreover, Li-excess local configurations can stabilize the lattice oxygen and provide a favorable cathode-electrolyte interface, which synergistically relieves the structural degradation during electrochemical cycling, thus guaranteeing exceptional cycling stability (e.g., 82.5% after 1000 cycles at 1000 mA g-1). These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of defect/electronic structure/ion transport and the intrinsic properties of polyanionic Li3V2(PO4)3 and may help to pave the way for other highly stable electrodes for rechargeable batteries.",

Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are essential for safer and more efficient Na+ and K+ batteries because they often exhibit low ionic conductivity at room temperature. While zwitterionic (ZW) materials enhance Li+ battery conductivity, their potential for Na+ and K+ transport in batteries remains unexplored. In this study, we investigated the effect of three ZW molecules (ChoPO4, i.e., 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine, ImSO3, i.e., sulfobetaine ethylimidazole, and ImCO2, i.e., carboxybetaine ethylimidazole) on the dissociation of Na+ and K+ coordination with ethylene oxide (EO) chains in EO-based electrolytes through molecular dynamics simulations. Our results showed that ChoPO4 possessed the highest cation–EO10 dissociation ability, while ImSO3 exhibited the lowest. Such dissociation ability correlated with the cation–ZW molecule coordination strength: ChoPO4 and ImSO3 showed the strongest and the weakest coordination with cations. However, the cation–ZW molecule coordination could slow the cationic diffusion. The competition of these effects resulted in accelerating or decelerating cationic diffusion. Our simulated results showed that ImCO2 enhanced Na+ diffusion by 20%, while ChoPO4 and ImSO3 led to a 10% reduction. For K+, ChoPO4 reduced its diffusion by 40%, while ImCO2 and ImSO3 caused a similar decrease of 15%. These findings suggest that the ZW structure and the cationic size play an important role in the ionic dissociation effect of ZW materials.",

We have investigated metallic lithium particle nucleation following lithiation and delithiation steps of the graphite electrode using X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Metallic lithium aggregates like dendrites and/or filaments which are formed during electrochemical cycling on the graphite anode are complex structures which may lead to internal short-circuit and safety issues. Understanding and following, in real conditions, this nucleation process is necessary to improve the development of Li-ion batteries. The complexity to detect metallic lithium structures inside Li-ion batteries depends on the number of EPR lines and their linewidth. The presence of lithiated graphite phases affects the detection of micrometric Li-metal elements. Herein, we report a new approach using cw-EPR (continuous-wave EPR) spectroscopy and imaging, combining the first- and second-harmonic detection schemes to provide evidence for the metallic lithium aggregate nucleation in these negative electrodes. Although the first harmonic gives all the EPR signals present in the sample, it is found that the second-harmonic EPR signal is mainly sensitive to metallic lithium depositions.\n",

By converting a constrained optimal control problem into an output tracking problem with multiple tracking references, the required control input, i.e., the charging current, is obtained by computing a series of candidate currents associated with different tracking references. Consequently, an optimization-free nonlinear model inversion-based control algorithm is derived for charging the batteries. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method using a spatially discretized high-fidelity pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) model with thermal dynamics. Conventional methods require computationally demanding optimization to solve the corresponding fast-charging problem for such a high-order system, leading to practical difficulties in achieving low-cost implementation.

        "abstract": "Li metal is considered as an ideal anode for Li-based batteries. Unfortunately, the growth of Li dendrites during cycling leads to an unstable interface, a low coulombic efficiency, and a limited cycling life. Here, a novel approach is proposed to protect the Li-metal anode by using a uniform agarose film. This natural biopolymer film exhibits a high ionic conductivity, high elasticity, and chemical stability. These properties enable a fast Li-ion transfer and feasiblity to accomodate the volume change of Li metal, resulting in a dendrite-free anode and a stable interface. Morphology characterization shows that Li ions migrate through the agarose film and then deposit underneath it. A full cell with the cathode of LiFPO4 and an anode contaning the agarose film exhibits a capacity retention of 87.1% after 500 cycles, much better than that with Li foil anode (70.9%) and Li-deposited Cu anode (5%). This study provides a promising strategy to eliminate dendrites and enhance the cycling ability of lithium-metal batteries through coating a robust artificial film of natural biopolymer on lithium-metal anode.",

An atomic characterization of these solutions is important for determining their structure-property relations, which will allow for the rational design of new and improved lithium ion based energy storage technologies. In this study, a combination of infrared spectroscopies and density functional theory calculations was used to investigate the speciation of the lithium ion (free ion, solvent separated ion pair, contact ion pairs, and aggregates) in dimethyl carbonate solutions having concentrations ranging from 1 M to 3 M. The experimental data shows that at typical battery electrolyte concentrations the lithium ion exists predominantly as free ions and solvent separated ion pairs, but charged contact ion pairs are also present in small concentrations. In contrast, at high concentrations the lithium ion is present in aggregates, but a noticeable fraction remains present as free ions.",

Preparation of high-performance LiMnPO4 still remains a great challenge because of its intrinsically low Li-ion/electronic conductivity.

We find that acidity plays a critical role in altering the morphology of the LiMnPO4 crystals.

        "title": "Exploring the Relationship between Interfacial Chemistry and Thermal Safety of a Flame Retarding Semisolid Electrolyte",
        "abstract": "The safety-related performance of LIBs still remains as a major issue even after more than three decades of commercialization.1 When typical electrolytes composed of flammable organic liquid solvents vaporize and decompose exothermically during thermal runaway, they pose serious risk to human health and infrastructure.2 Conventional lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are energy storage devices which function as electrochemical systems subject to highly dynamic heterogeneous reaction phenomena. As a result, the tolerance levels of tangible harm to users and surrounding environments may be amplified considerably as scale and pervasiveness of technology increases. Beyond consumer devices, large-scale energy storage to complement renewable power generation technologies is instrumental to the goal of decarbonization via electrification and thus global goals for carbon neutrality in the 21st century. Renewable power generation benefits substantially from decoupling the spatial and temporal points of energy generation from that of demand.\n Recent efforts in academia and industry alike have endeavored to replace volatile and flammable conventional liquid electrolytes (composed of classes of compounds such as carbonates or ethers) with intrinsically nonflammable liquid electrolytes (composed of fluorinated and phosphorus-containing organic solvents).3–5 Simultaneously, solid-state electrolytes have been touted as an avenue to not only wholly replace the liquid component of the cell to improve safety, but also as a higher-energy density next-generation battery electrolyte.6 However, these strategies are often examined as materials-level design choices for improving “built-in” safety and not as changes to a dynamic and multiscale electrochemical system.\n In this study, we find that the intrinsic safety of a system is highly dependent on the interfacial degradation pathways of the electrode-electrolyte configuration, which acts as a direct complement to the thermal behavior which may result in thermal runaway. Through detailed multimodal calorimetry and characterization of the interfacial composition, this work subsequently brings the question of flammability into focus as a downstream consequence of the interfacial reaction kinetics. This is accomplished through the combined efforts of thermal analyses as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy accompanied with electron crystallography analyses, and nuclear magnetic resonance studies of the ionic transport behavior through the polymeric electrolyte. Through these efforts, design principles centered around holistic assessment of the lifespan of materials and their electrochemical and thermal interactions are developed towards the greater goal of improving the safety and resilience of LIBs and their devices against the wide spectrum of abuse scenarios created by their expanding application space.\n \n (1) Feng, X.; Ren, D.; He, X.; Ouyang, M.

        "abstract": "A practical, commercially viable microfluidic device relies upon the miniaturization and integration of all its components--including pumps, circuitry, and power supply--onto a chip-based platform. Surface acoustic waves (SAW) have become popular in microfluidic manipulation, in solving the problems of microfluidic manipulation, but practical applications employing SAW still require more power than available via a battery. Introducing amplitude modulation at 0.5-40 kHz in SAW nebulization, which requires the highest energy input levels of all known SAW microfluidic processes, halves the power required to 1.5 W even while including the power in the sidebands, suitable for small lithium ion batteries, and maintains the nebulization rate, size, and size distributions vital to drug inhalation therapeutics. This simple yet effective means to enable an integrated SAW microfluidics device for nebulization exploits the relatively slow hydrodynamics and is furthermore shown to deliver shear-sensitive biomolecules--plasmid DNA and antibodies as exemplars of future pulmonary gene and vaccination therapies--undamaged in the nebulized mist. Altogether, the approach demonstrates a means to offer truly micro-scale microfluidics devices in a handheld, battery powered SAW nebulization device.",

        "abstract": "Much of our understanding of physical behavior of materials is based on the concept of equilibrium, which lies at the heart of classical thermodynamics, condensed matter physics, and modern reaction kinetics. If a thermodynamic system is in equilibrium conditions, which is the situation when an energy system (e.g., a fuel cell or a battery) is under open circuit voltage, the surface and bulk of the electrode are only subject to fluctuation of thermodynamic qualities. For the cases that are not at equilibrium, but are close to it, Onsager established linear reciprocal relationships between flux and thermodynamic force for a thermodynamic system in nonequilibrium states. These linear relationships are manifested in transport phenomena, which are non-equilibrium processes, such as ion diffusion and heat conduction.\n When an electrochemical reaction takes place at an electrode of a fuel cell, electrolyzer, or battery, the thermodynamic system is far away from equilibrium. Therefore, the thermodynamic states of the surface and bulk of an electrode are subject to external thermodynamic forces. As a result, in an active electrode, the electrochemical reaction on the surface causes all thermodynamic variables to change in both the surface and the bulk. In this talk, I will use solid oxide cells and lithium-ion batteries as an example to address three questions related to materials in non-equilibrium thermodynamic states: (i) how do fast kinetics and high current in an operating electrochemical cell affect the thermodynamic states of its material constituents, (ii) whether or not the state of non-equilibrium can remain stable with constant flow of matter and energy, and (iii) what is the origin that governs activity and stability in solid oxide cells?",

        "abstract": "Poly(vinylidenefluoride‐co‐hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF‐HFP) is one of the most promising candidate electrolyte matrices for high energy batteries. However, the spherical skeleton structure obtained through the conventional method fails to build continuous Li ion transmission channels due to the slow volatilization of high boiling solvent, leading to inferior cycling performance, especially in a Ni‐rich system. Herein, a novel strategy is presented to enrich the Li ion transfer paths and improve the Li ion migration kinetics. The tactic is to prepare cross‐linked segments through the PVDF‐HFP matrix by adopting free radical polymerization and Li salt induced ring‐opening polymerization. Most significantly, the visualization of the structure of as‐prepared electrolyte is innovatively realized with the combination of polarization microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscope‐energy dispersive spectroscopy, PVDF‐HFP, and cross‐linked network form interconnected microstructures. Therefore, poly(glycidyl methacrylate and acrylonitrile)@poly(vinylidene fluoride‐hexafluoropropylene) electrolyte presents a high ionic conductivity (1.04 mS cm−1 at 30 °C) and a stable voltage profile for a Li/Li cell after 1200 h. After assembly with a LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 cathode, a high discharge specific capacity of 190.3 mAh g−1 is delivered, and the capacity retention reaches 88.2% after 100 cycles.

        "abstract": "K+/Cl− and K+/F− co-doped LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) materials were successfully synthesized via a solid-state method. Structural characterization revealed that both K+/Cl− and K+/F− co-doping reduced the LixNi1−xO impurities and enlarged the lattice parameters compared to those of pure LNMO. Besides this, the K+/F− co-doping decreased the Mn3+ ion content, which could inhibit the Jahn–Teller distortion and was beneficial to the cycling performance. Furthermore, both the K+/Cl− and the K+/F− co-doping reduced the particle size and made the particles more uniform. The K+/Cl− co-doped particles possessed a similar octahedral structure to that of pure LNMO. In contrast, as the K+/F− co-doping amount increased, the crystal structure became a truncated octahedral shape. The Li+ diffusion coefficient calculated from the CV tests showed that both K+/Cl− and K+/F− co-doping facilitated Li+ diffusion in the LNMO. The impedance tests showed that the charge transfer resistances were reduced by the co-doping. These results indicated that both the K+/Cl− and the K+/F− co-doping stabilized the crystal structures, facilitated Li+ diffusion, modified the particle morphologies, and increased the electrochemical kinetics. Benefiting from the unique advantages of the co-doping, the K+/Cl− and K+/F− co-doped samples exhibited improved rate and cycling performances. The K+/Cl− co-doped Li0.97K0.03Ni0.5Mn1.5O3.97Cl0.03 (LNMO-KCl0.03) exhibited the best rate capability with discharge capacities of 116.1, 109.3, and 93.9 mAh g−1 at high C-rates of 5C, 7C, and 10C, respectively. Moreover, the K+/F− co-doped Li0.98K0.02Ni0.5Mn1.5O3.98F0.02 (LNMO-KF0.02) delivered excellent cycling stability, maintaining 85.8% of its initial discharge capacity after circulation for 500 cycles at 5C. Therefore, the K+/Cl− or K+/F− co-doping strategy proposed herein will play a significant role in the further construction of other high-voltage cathodes for high-energy LIBs.",

        "abstract": "The decline of lithium-ion battery (LIB) performance at low temperatures, caused by the non-uniform occurrence of electrochemical reactions during cycling and the resulting irreversible capacity loss, significantly hinders further LIB commercialization. Herein, we report the first solution by analyzing the impedance using symmetric cells in the absence of charge-transfer reactions to obtain a parameter quantitatively describing ion transport in porous electrodes and thus modeling the effects of non-uniform reaction occurrence. The reciprocal of ionic resistance in porous electrodes obtained (Rion-1) is found to be positively correlated with capacity retention during low-temperature cycling and is approximated as the product of maximum capacitance related to electric double layer formation (Cdl, max) and the associated frequency (f0). Consequently, these ion-transport parameters can be used to predict capacity retention during low-temperature cycling, and the adopted approach therefore help to mitigate low-temperature LIB performance degradation and thus contribute to the fabrication of next-generation rechargeable batteries.",

However, with graphite electrodes, neat ILs afford weak cycling performance in the absence of organic additives (e.g., vinylene carbonate, VC). The potential formation of a [Li+]-OVC interaction/coordination could have a major influence on the observed electrochemical behavior of Li-ion batteries.

        "abstract": "The Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) as anode of lithium (Li) ion batteries has high interfacial side reactivity with electrolyte, which leads to severe gassing behavior and poor cycling stability. Herein, the capacity loss mechanism of high-tap density LTO microsphere anode under different temperatures (25, 45 and 60 ℃) and charge/discharge rates (1 and 5C) is systematically investigated. The capacity retentions of the LTO/Li cell after 500 cycles at 1C are 95.6, 90.0 and 87.1% under three temperatures, respectively, which drop to 91.9, 58.3 and 20.9% when cycling at 5C. Results show that the high temperature and rate almost do not damage the structure of LTO, but greatly affect the thickness and components of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI), and consequently injure the performance of the LTO/Li cells. An SEI mainly consisting of inorganic species forms on LTO after 500 cycles at 1C, while organic compounds are observed after 500 cycles at 5C. The capacity of cycled LTO cannot recover again due to the thick SEI although using new Li metal anode, separator and electrolyte. This work demonstrates that it is of great significance for LTO to construct a stable SEI for achieving excellent cycling performance at high rate and temperature.",

        "abstract": "Porous carbon and nanocarbons have been extensively applied as anode materials for high-energy density lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, as another representative nanocarbon, fullerenes, such as C60, have been scarcely utilized in LIBs because of their poor electrochemical reversibility. Herein, we designed a novel C60-embedded nitrogen-doped microporous carbon material (denoted as C60@N-MPC), which was derived from a zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) precursor, demonstrating its promising application as a superior anode material for LIB. We first embedded C60in situ into a ZIF-8 matrix via a facile solid-state mechanochemical route, which acted as a precursor and was transformed to C60@N-MPC after carbonization. The C60@N-MPC was applied as a novel anode for LIBs, showing an improved reversible specific capacity of ≈1351 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and a better rate capacity (≈1077 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 400 cycles) relative to those based on the unmodified N-MPC anode. The role of C60 in the superior lithium storage performance of C60@N-MPC was elucidated, revealing that C60 functioned as a pore expander for N-MPC with 3-20 nm mesopores (versus sub-1 nm micropores for the unmodified N-MPC), which facilitated the rapid diffusion of the organic electrolyte.",

We demonstrate here that after coating polypropylene (PP) separator with a continuous monolayer graphene, the shuttle effect can be significantly suppressed by limiting the passage of long-chain LiPS. The graphene/PP separator can be further modified by sealing the big holes or pores on graphene with in situ polymerized nylon-66 via an interfacial polymerization reaction between diamine and adipoyl chloride supplied by the aqueous and oil phase, respectively, from each side of the membrane. With this engineered membrane, an initial specific capacity of 1128.4 mAh g-1 at 0.05C is achieved after test in a coin cell, higher than that of 983.2 mAh g-1 with pristine PP, along with increased Coulombic efficiency from 96.0 to 99.9% and enhanced cycling durability. Molecular dynamics simulations attest that the nanopores with appropriate size and structure are effective in acting as a \"sieve\" to selectively allow only Li+ ions to pass through but prevent LiPS from migrating to the anode, consequently alleviating the shuttle effect. Our method provides a facile solution toward the mitigated shuttle effect and eventually contributes to the high performance of Li-S battery.",

        "title": "Mesoporous Carbons Produced from Tannin Biomass for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries",
        "abstract": "Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) are promising alternatives since sulfur can provide a theoretical specific capacity of 1675 mA h g-1 when combined with lithium [1]. Thus, LSBs can achieve a theoretical energy density (2500 W h kg-1) that is much greater than that of conventional lithium-ion batteries [1]. However, several problems must be resolved to enable commercial production on a large scale, such as the formation of soluble species of lithium polysulfides [2]. Various approaches have been used to minimize this problem, including the development of carbon-based hosts capable of retaining these polysulfides. Among these, the development of cathodes based on carbon‒sulfur composites using carbon from biomass is an alternative that benefits from the possibility of obtaining materials with a modifiable surface area and porosity at low cost [2]. On this basis, this work reports the synthesis of mesoporous carbons (MCs) from tannin biomass, the incorporation of sulfur and the development of lithium-sulfur batteries. The MC sample was produced using the solvent-free method [3] and was named C. The incorporation of sulfur into mesoporous carbons was carried out using melt diffusion methodology [4]. Two quantities of sulfur were added to the carbon host by mass, and the materials were named CS1 and CS2 at ratios of 1:1 and 2:1, respectively, in relation to sulfur:MC. Coin cells (CR 2032) were assembled using the produced materials on the cathode, metallic Li on the anode and the electrolyte 1 M LiTFSI and 1% (w/v) LiNO3 in 1,2-dimethoxyethane/1,3-dioxolane (DME/DOL) and characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) cycling. The mesoporous carbon C presented a type IV isotherm characteristic of mesoporous materials, with a BET surface area of 539 m2g-1, average pore size of 7.7 nm and total pore volume of 0.747 cm3g-1. There was a decrease in the area and pore volume of the materials after sulfur incorporation, reaching 70 m2g-1 and 0.195 cm3g-1 for CS1 and 3 m2g-1 and 0.012 cm3g-1 for CS2, respectively. The sulfur contents were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and were 39% and 61% for CS1 and CS2, respectively. The sulfur contents determined by TGA were close to those obtained by elemental analysis (CHNS), which were 45% and 63% for CS1 and CS2, respectively. The CV data showed that both cells presented cathodic and anodic potentials typical of Li-S batteries. The GCD data show that the cell containing the cathode with the material with a higher elemental sulfur content (CS 2) is stable and maintains specific capacities on the order of 550 mA h g-1 after 45 galvanostatic cycles at different current densities. However, this cell showed a more abrupt decrease in capacity at the highest rates (2C and 4C), Figure 1. Most likely, the higher sulfur content used in this sample did not result in total impregnation of the porous structure, resulting in sulfur deposition on the surface of the particles. As a result, the interparticle contact resistance in the electrodes increases, which limits the performance at higher current demands. For the cell built with the sample containing 39% S (CS1), excellent performance is obtained at high C rates. At 0.1 C, the cathode operates above 900 mA h g-1 in the initial cycles and above 550 mA h g-1 at 0.5 C, and no significant capacity drop is observed between 1 C and 2 C (≈500 mA h g-1). At 4C, a decrease in the specific capacity is noted, but the specific capacity remains above 350 mA h g-1. These results demonstrate the potential of carbon materials obtained from biomass for building high-performance Li-S batteries.\n Acknowledgments: The authors thank the financial support from the Rota 2030 Program at Fundep – Brazil.\n References:\n [1] Chen, Y., Wang, T., Tian, H., Su, D., Zhang, Q., & Wang, G.

        "abstract": "Boron, the most ideal lithium‐ion battery anode material, demonstrates highest theoretical capacity up to 12 395 mA h g−1 when forming Li5B. Furthermore, it also exhibits promising features such as light weight, considerable reserves, low cost, and nontoxicity. However, boron‐based materials are not in the hotspot list because Li5B may only exist when B is in atomically isolated/dispersed form, while the aggregate material can barely be activated to store/release Li. At this time, an ingenious design is demonstrated to activate the inert B to a high specific capacity anode material by dispersing it in a Fe matrix. The above material can be obtained after an electrochemical activation of the precursors Fe2B/Fe and B2O3/Fe. The latter harvests the admirable capacity, ultrahigh tap density of 2.12 g cm−3, excellent cycling stability of 3180 mA h cm−3 at 0.1 A g−1 (1500 mA h g−1) after 250 cycles, and superlative rate capability of 2650 mA h cm−3 at 0.5 A g−1, 2544 mA h cm−3 at 1.0 A g−1, and 1696 mA h cm−3 at 2.0 A g−1.

        "abstract": "Most of the recently commercialized active materials for lithium-ion batteries (LiB) adopt secondary particles, and most of them are designed by evaluating cell-level electrochemical properties. Therefore, the relationship between particle design and battery performance is not properly understood because it is not possible to grasp the intrinsic properties of the electrode active material. Therefore, a single particle measurement technique has been developed in which a gold or platinum filament having a diameter of several tens of microns is directly contacted with a single particle to evaluate the single particle electrochemical properties. However, since it is a non-sealed battery system, only less-volatile electrolytes can be applied. Also, the experiment is difficult because the contact between particle and filament can easily break down with small vibration. Additionally, there are a lot of particle design parameters such as particle shape, size, and size distribution. Moreover, with operating conditions, the particle design needs to be changed. So, it is challenging to cover all cases by experiment.\n In this study, digital-twin structure of a single secondary particle was formed using focused ion beam / scanning electron microscope. Using the digital-twin structure, digital-twin electrochemo-mechanical model was developed and more than 99% of accuracy was secured by comparing the voltage profiles with result of single particle measurement technique. Using the well-matched model. Operando analysis of electrochemical properties (State of Lithiation, overpotential, potential, and concentration) and mechanical properties (von Mises stress and strain energy density) were performed. The strain energy density can be the criteria to determine the crack formation by comparing with the fracture toughness which is the strain energy density when the fracture occurs.",

        "abstract": "Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have emerged as the most commercialized rechargeable battery technology. However, their inherent property, called thermal runaway, poses a high risk of fire. This article introduces the “Battery Immersed in Fire Prevention Material (BIF)”, the immersion-type battery in which all of the LIB cells are surrounded by a liquid agent. This structure and the agent enable active battery fire suppression under abusive conditions while facilitating improved thermal management during normal operation. Abuse tests involving a battery revealed that the LIB module experienced fire, explosions, and burnouts with the target cell reaching temperatures of 1405 °C and the side reaching 796 °C. Conversely, the BIF module exhibited a complete lack of fire propagation, with temperatures lower than those of LIBs, particularly 285 and 17 °C, respectively. Under normal operating conditions, the BIF module exhibited an average temperature rise ~8.6 times lower than that of a normal LIB. Furthermore, it reduced the uneven thermal deviation between the cells by ~5.3 times more than LIB. This study provides a detailed exploration of the BIF and covers everything from components to practical applications. With further improvements, this technology can significantly enhance fire safety and prevent the thermal degradation of batteries in the real world.",

        "abstract": "Owing to the advantages of high safety, low cost, high theoretical volumetric capacities, and environmental friendliness, magnesium-ion batteries (MIBs) have more feasibility for large-scale energy storage compared to lithium-ion batteries. However, lack of suitable cathode materials due to sluggish kinetics of magnesium ion is one of the biggest challenges. Herein, water-pillared sodium vanadium bronze nanowires (Na2 V6 O16 ·1.63H2 O) are reported as cathode material for MIBs, which display high performance in magnesium storage. The hydrated sodium ions provide excellent structural stability. The charge shielding effect of lattice water enables fast Mg2+ diffusion. It exhibits high specific capacity of 175 mAh g-1 , long cycle life (450 cycles), and high coulombic efficiency (≈100%). At high current density of 200 mA g-1 , the capacity retention is up to 71% even after 450 cycles (compared to the highest capacity), demonstrating excellent long-term cycling performance. The nature of charge storage kinetics is explored. Furthermore, a highly reversible structure change during the electrochemical process is proved by comprehensive electrochemical analysis. The remarkable electrochemical performance makes Na2 V6 O16 ·1.63H2 O a promising cathode material for low-cost and safe MIBs.",

        "abstract": "X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) provides important information on metal oxidation state and\n element-specific coordination, but data collection has historically required the energy specificity\n and brilliance of a synchrotron facility. Recent developments in detectors and optics are now\n bringing XAS capabilities to the laboratory setting through multiple commercially available\n instruments. At the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, we use laboratory-based XAS to explore the\n local electronic and atomic structure of a class of disordered vanadium ferrite (VFe2Ox) aerogels\n that exhibit promising performance for electrochemical energy-storage applications such as\n rechargeable lithium-ion batteries.1,2 These materials are synthesized by an epoxide-promoted sol–\n gel reaction of iron chloride and vanadium isopropoxide, with the resulting fluid-filled gels\n rendered as high surface area aerogels via supercritical-CO2 drying. During the initial sol–gel\n synthesis, electroinactive metals such as aluminum, zinc, and zirconium may also be substituted\n for vanadium and iron to alter the local electronic environment and corresponding electrochemical\n performance of VFe2Ox. Heat treatment of as-dried VFe2Ox aerogels under either O2-containing\n or inert atmosphere yields disordered or nanocrystalline variants, respectively. The resulting series\n of native and substituted VFe2Ox materials are evaluated as powder-composite cathodes versus\n lithium metal in coin cells with conventional nonaqueous lithium-ion electrolyte. We correlate\n such critical battery-performance parameters as total specific capacity, high-rate capability, and\n cycle life as a function of VFe2Ox composition and its degree of structural order/disorder, as\n measured with in-situ XANES and EXAFS. In parallel with experimental observations,\n calculations on VFe2Ox reveal that V incorporates into the defective spinel structure at tetrahedral\n sites and that both disorder induced by vacancies and Fe/V tetrahedral occupation lowers the\n overall energy and opens an electronic energy gap that establishes the redox sequence during\n lithiation.\n 1.

In this study, water-soluble poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) with low carbon yield is selected to make the process water-based and to achieve a high silicon yield in the composite. It was also found that increasing the amount of graphene helps keep the PVA fiber morphology after carbonization, while forming a graphene network. The fiber SEM and HRTEM images reveal that micrometer graphene is heavily folded into sub-micron scale fibers during electrospinning, while Si NPs are incorporated into the folds with nanospace in between. When applied to lithium-ion battery anodes, the Si/graphene/carbon nanofiber composites show a high reversible capacity of ∼2300 mAh g(-1) at a charging rate of 100 mA/g and a stable capacity of 1191 mAh g(-1) at 1 A/g after more than 200 cycles. The interconnected graphene network not only ensures the excellent conductivity but also serves as a buffering matrix for the mechanic stress caused by volume change; the nanospace between Si NPs and folded graphene provides the space needed for volume expansion.",

Comprehensive structural study based on (1) infrared (IR)/Raman spectroscopy, (2) high-energy X-ray total scattering (HEXTS), and (3) molecular dynamics (MD) simulation revealed the solvation (or coordination) structures of Li ions in TFEP-based electrolytes at the molecular level. In binary LiFSA/TFEP with a Li salt concentration (cLi) < 1.0 mol dm-3, Li ions are coordinated with both TFEP and FSA components; in detail, two TFEP molecules coordinate in an O-donating monodentate manner and one FSA in an O-donating bidentate manner to form [Li(TFEP)2(bi-FSA)] as the major species. We demonstrated that adding acetonitrile (AN) to the LiFSA/TFEP electrolytes caused structural changes in the Li-ion complexes. The bi-FSA bound to the Li ion changed its coordination mode to mono-FSA, which was induced by solvating AN molecules to Li ions. The redox reaction corresponding to insertion/deinsertion of Li ions into/from the graphite electrode successfully occurred in 1.0 mol dm-3 LiFSA/TFEP with an AN electrolyte system, while there was no or reduced Li-ion insertion in the electrolyte without AN. We discussed the relationship between the structure and electrode reaction of the Li-ion complexes based on the FSA-coordination characteristics; i.e., in LiFSA/TFEP with the AN system, the mono-FSA bound to the Li ion is easier to decoordinate due to weaker Li+mono-FSA- interactions rather than the Li+bi-FSA- interactions, which mainly contribute to charge-transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface to allow Li-ion insertion/deinsertion in the graphite anode.",

Gas leakage is an early and reliable indicator for such irreversible malfunctioning of electrical accumulators. Often, accurate gas emission source location sensing is difficult especially in heavy operational conditions, related to temperature changes, vibrations, movements, accelerations, etc. In this paper we propose a gas detection system, with catalytic type sensor array, and a numerical reconstruction method for precise gas emission source location inside the battery pack. The detection system employs a distributed array of CO sensors. Proposed sensor array configurations significantly reduce the number of sensing nodes inside the battery pack and fewer sensors than the protected battery elements are used. This way, data acquisition process by sensor nodes is also simplified. Several array configurations are considered according to their measurement efficiency and accuracy. Reconstruction algorithm is based on fast interpolation technique very suitable for real-time data processing. Estimation of reconstruction method accuracy is made by computational model of the gas diffusion inside the pack.",

These anodes necessitate the use of a binder to maintain the electrode integrity during the immense volume change of silicon during cycling. Here, Zn2+–imidazole coordination crosslinks that are formed to carboxymethyl cellulose backbones in situ during electrode fabrication are reported. The recoverable nature of Zn2+–imidazole coordination bonds and the flexibility of the poly(ethylene glycol) chains are jointly responsible for the high elasticity of the binder network. The high elasticity tightens interparticle contacts and sustains the electrode integrity, both of which are beneficial for long‐term cyclability. These electrodes, with their commercial levels of areal capacities, exhibit superior cycle life in full‐cells paired with LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 cathodes.

The converter, switched at 2 MHz from a 5-V input, experimentally achieves 89.7% peak efficiency and 6% higher efficiency at full load than a Buck converter counterpart.

Here, we show the correlations between these factors using in situ transmission electron microscopy. The results show that Li ions are extracted through tortuous paths connecting the Li-containing a-b planes in the crystals. Moreover, the grain boundary resistance depends not only on the misorientations of the neighboring grains. Even twins with misorientation angles of 70° are not decisive factors in Li movement. We also show the existence of two-phase separation in single crystals between two hexagonal phases during fast charging. These results provide valuable information for determining the optimal grain architecture and for material design, helping enhance high capacity and high stability.",

        "abstract": "Electrochemical energy storage (EES) is still key to realize wide spread use of renewable energies. For large-scale EES production, the development of high energy density, non-toxic, cost-effective materials is necessary. In this study, a cobalt free active material, Lithium Nickel Manganese Oxide, LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO), was employed in the production of cathodes for high voltage lithium ion battery (LIB) applications. LNMO is an attractive cathode active material due to its high operating potential (~4.7 vs. Li/Li+ [1]), non-toxicity and low cost. The practical application of LNMO cathodes in LIBs has been relatively limited, especially for large scale application, due challenges associated with the material (i.e. electrolyte decomposition at high voltage, self-discharge and dissolution of the transition metals [2]).\n Electrolyte additives are an effective way to address these challenges, without major cost increase or changes to the production approach. In this study the role of different electrolyte additives in high-voltage full-cell LIBs with both graphite and silicon-graphite anodes is investigated. Additives known for their solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) forming ability (i.e. vinylene carbonate (VC) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC)), as well as additives that play additional roles such as cathode electrolyte interface formation or HF scavenging (i.e. tris(trimethylsilyl) phosphite (TMSP) and succinate anhydride (SA)), are used [3]. Galvanostatic cycling measurements were performed in 3-electrode cells in order to investigate the rate capability and long term cycling stability of LMNO/Gr and LMNO/Gr-Si full-cells with different electrolyte additives. The electrochemical characterization was verified with post mortem analysis to confirm the SEI composition, chemical and mechanical stability of the electrodes and lack of lithium plating. Post mortem investigations were done with Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDX) and optical microscopy. Improved rate performance and better long term cycling stability of both full-cell chemistries was achieved for electrolytes containing the TMSP additive.\n \n References:\n \n [1] G. Gabrielli, M.

        "abstract": "A variation in batteries' physical or chemical specifications right from the manufacturing process causes a slight difference in battery capacity in a battery pack. The imperfection resulting from the production causes the imbalance state of charge (SoC) level that will eventually start to become significant over long-term operation and lead to irreversible damage to the whole battery pack earlier than the expected battery life cycle. To solve the cell imbalance issue and maximize the usable battery pack capacity, an active cell self-equalization algorithm based on the estimated SoC with 24 lithium-ion batteries connected in series was developed. A bidirectional flyback converter equalizer circuit topology was implemented, allowing the charge transfer from cell to pack and from pack to cell. The results prove that the algorithm is applicable for real-time equalization on an imbalanced battery pack in energy storage management systems (ESMSs).",

        "abstract": "Microstructural engineering on nickel-rich layered oxide (NRLO) cathode materials is considered a promising approach to increase both the capacity and lifespan of lithium-ion batteries by introducing high valence-state elements. However, rational regulation on NRLO microstructures based on a deep understanding of its capacity enhancement mechanism remains challenging. Herein for the first time, we demonstrate that an increase of 14 mAh·g-1 in reversible capacity at the first cycle can be achieved via tailoring the micro and nano structure of NRLO through introducing tungsten. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy characterization reveals that the formation of a modified microstructure featured as coherent spinel twin boundaries. Theoretical modeling and electrochemical investigations further demonstrate that the capacity increase mechanism is related to such coherent spinel twin boundaries, which could lower the Li+ diffusion barrier and thus allow more Li+ to participate in deeper phase transitions. Meanwhile, the surface and grain boundaries of NRLOs are found to be modified by generating a dense and uniform LiWxOy phase, which further extends its cycle life by reducing side reactions with electrolytes. This work enables a comprehensive understanding of the capacity-increased mechanism and endows the remarkable potential of microstructural engineering for capacity- and lifespan-increased NRLOs.

        "abstract": "Intensive research is underway to further enhance the performance of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). To increase the capacity of positive electrode materials, Li-rich layered oxides (LLO) are attracting attention but have not yet been put to practical use. The structural mechanisms through which LLO materials exhibit higher capacity than conventional materials remain unclear because their disordered phases make it difficult to obtain structural information by conventional analysis. The X-ray total scattering analysis reveals a disordered structure consisting of metal ions in octahedral and tetrahedral sites of Li layers as a result of cation mixing after the extraction of Li ions. Metal ions in octahedral sites act as rigid pillars. The metal ions move to the tetrahedral site of the Li layer, which functions as a Li-layer pillar during Li extraction, and returns to the metal site during Li insertion, facilitating Li diffusion as an adaptive pillar. Adaptive pillars are the specific structural features that differ from those of the conventional layered materials, and their effects are responsible for the high capacity of LLO materials. An essential understanding of the pillar effects will contribute to design guidelines for intercalation-type positive electrodes for next-generation LIBs.",

The method employed herein allowed for linear growth of visually homogeneous films composed of V(2)O(5), V(2)O(5)/PAH, and V(2)O(5)/PAH/AgNP with 15 bilayers. According to the Fourier transform infrared spectra, interaction between the oxygen atom of the vanadyl group and the amino group should be responsible for the growth of these films. This interaction also enabled establishment of an electrostatic shield between the lithium ions and the sites with higher negative charge, thereby raising the ionic mobility and consequently increasing the energy storage capacity and reducing the response time. According to the site-saturation model and the electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical results, the presence of PAH in the self-assembled host matrix decreased the number of V(2)O(5) electroactive sites. Thus, AgNPs were stabilized in PAH and inserted into the nanoarchitecture, so as to enhance the specific capacity. This should provide new conducting pathways and connect isolated V(2)O(5) particles in the host matrix. Therefore, new nanoarchitectures for specific interactions were formed spontaneously and chosen as examples in this work, aiming to demonstrate the potentiality of the adopted self-assembled method for enhancing the charge transport rate into the host matrices. The obtained materials displayed suitable properties for use as electrodes in lithium batteries and electrochromic devices.",

The morphological evolution process of the Zn2GeO4 was investigated in detail by tuning the ratio of En to H2O in different solvent systems, and a series of compounds with awl-shaped, fascicular, and cross-linked hierarchical structures was obtained and employed as anode materials in lithium-ion batteries. The materials with fascicular structure exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, and a specific reversible capacity of 1034 mA h g-1 was retained at a current density of 0.5 A g-1 after 160 cycles. In addition, the as-prepared nanostructured electrode also delivered impressive rate capability of 315 mA h g-1 at the current density of 10 A g-1. The remarkable electrochemical performances could be ascribed to the following aspects. First, each unit in the three-dimensional fascicular structure can effectively buffer the volume expansions during the Li+ extraction/insertion process, accommodate the strain induced by the volume variation, and stabilize its whole configuration. Meanwhile, the small fascicular units can enlarge the electrode/electrolyte contact area and form an integrated interlaced conductive network which provides continuous electron/ion pathways.",

        "abstract": "O2‐type layered oxides have emerged as promising cathode materials for high‐energy lithium‐ion batteries, offering a solution to mitigate voltage decay through reversible transition metal (TM) migration between TM and Li layers during cycling. However, achieving a fully reversible oxygen redox remains a significant challenge. Here, this is addressed by introducing Li─O─Li configurations in the layered structure of Li0.85□0.15[Li0.08□0.04Ni0.22Mn0.66]O2 (O2‐LLNMO), where □ represents vacancies. This adjustment alters the redox‐active oxygen environment and increases the energy gap between the O 2p nonbonding and TM─O antibonding bands. As a result, the contribution of lattice oxygen to capacity is significantly enhanced, improving the reversibility of oxygen redox processes. The O2‐LLNMO cathode demonstrates minimal voltage decay (0.13 mV per cycle) and excellent cycling stability, retaining 95.8% of its capacity after 100 cycles. A novel strategy is presented to design high‐performance layered oxides with stable anionic redox activity, advancing the development of next‐generation lithium‐ion batteries.",

It was found that the interior conformal N-C coating enhances the intrinsic conductivity of LFP nanorods (LFP NR) and the exterior reduced graphene oxide coating acts as an electrically conducting secondary network to electrically connect the entire electrode. The great electron transport mutually promoted with shorten Li diffusion length on (010) facet exposed LFP NR represents the highest specific capacity value recorded to date at 10 C and ultralong-term cyclability.

Effective estimation of SOC can bring accurate continuous mileage information to the driver, theoretically avoid overcharging and discharging the battery, and also protect the driver’s driving safety. In the research of SOC estimation method, constructing a suitable battery model is an important means to improve SOC estimation and to improve the prediction accuracy. In order to obtain a higher response accuracy of the model, this paper proposes an electric vehicle SOC model based on the extended Kalman filter algorithm. Based on the actual data of lithium-ion power battery, SOC estimation research is carried out. The research shows that: when the internal temperature of the battery is the same as the ambient temperature, and both are 25 °C, the model is accurate, the terminal voltage difference is small, and the average voltage difference is 9mV respectively; at room temperature, the extended Kalman filter algorithm has a significant effect on the recovery percentage of SOC voltage. The average is over 73%, and the accuracy is high. The extended Kalman algorithm in this paper we use to estimate the SOC current waveform. The simulation results show that the SOC discharge current is 4A, which has high estimation accuracy and strong applicability.",

The challenges only get amplified in case of solid state battery cells as the methods for introduction of electrolyte into the cathode structure need to be developed. Ideally, a cathode should support high energy density of a cell which implies necessity for high thickness. This requirement is not trivial to fulfil, both from the standpoint of manufacturing and from the standpoint of overcoming transport limitations in thick cathodes. In this work, inspired by the previous effort on graded porosity cathode design [1], we present a two-layer cathode based on LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC622). The cathode is built using a densified “energy layer” as a support for the “power layer” in which high porosity and low tortuosity is achieved by the freeze tape casting technique. The distribution of the material in the two layers is guided by numerical simulations based on actual cathode microstructure. The performance of the structured cathodes containing Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) with lithium bis-trifluoromethanesulfonimide (LiTFSI) was experimentally investigated in cells containing metallic lithium counter electrode. The structured cathodes showed more than double capacity values and improved Coulombic efficiency compared to uniform cathodes of the same material loading.\n [1] Kalnaus, S., Livingston, K., Hawley, W.B., Wang, H., Li, J., 2021, “Design and processing for high performance Li ion battery electrodes with double-layer structure J Energy Storage 44 (2021) 103582.\n \n Acknowledgments: This research at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), managed by UT Battelle, LLC, for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under contract DE-AC05-00OR22725, was sponsored by Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program at ORNL.",

But severe safety issues such as cracks or breakage, resulting in short circuits will prevent their widespread application. Here, we report a new design of self-healing solid polymer electrolyte (ShSPE) based on imine bonds, fabricated from varying amounts of polyoxyethylenebis(amine) and terephthalaldehyde through a simple Schiff base reaction. Moreover, adding diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A improves the flexibility and high stretchability of the polymer electrolyte. The polymer networks exhibit good thermal stability and excellent self-healing characteristics. The ShSPE with the highest NH2–PEG–NH2 content (ShSPE-3) has an improved lithium ion transference number of 0.39, and exhibits an electrochemical stability up to 4.5 V vs. Li/Li+. ShSPE-3 shows the highest ionic conductivity of 1.67 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 60 °C. Besides, the interfacial stability of ShSPE-3 is promoted and the electrolyte membrane exhibits good cycling performance with LiFePO4, and the LiFePO4/Li cell exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 141.3 mA h g −1. These results suggest that self-healing solid polymer electrolytes are promising candidates for high safety and stable lithium metal batteries.",

        "title": "Optimization study of a Z-type airflow cooling system of a lithium-ion battery pack",
        "abstract": "The present study aims to optimize the structural design of a Z-type flow lithium-ion battery pack with a forced air-cooling system known as BTMS (battery thermal management system). The main goal is to minimize Tmax (maximum temperature) and ΔTmax (maximum temperature difference) while ensuring an even airflow distribution within the battery module. The present study thoroughly investigates critical factors, such as the inlet air velocity, tapered inlet manifold, and the number of secondary outlets, to evaluate their impact on thermal performance and airflow uniformity within the battery module. Increasing the inlet air velocity from 3 to 4.5 m/s significantly improves the thermal cooling performance of the BTMS, resulting in a decrease of 4.57 °C (10.05%) in Tmax and 0.29 °C (9.79%) in ΔTmax compared to the original 3 m/s velocity. Further, the study assesses the significance of a tapered inlet manifold as a critical factor, revealing its substantial impact on cooling performance and temperature reductions in battery cells 3–9. It also facilitates a more uniform airflow distribution, decreasing the velocity difference between channel 9 and channel 1 from 3.32 to 2.50 m/s. Incorporating seven secondary outlets significantly improves the heat dissipation ability of the BTMS, resulting in a decrease of 0.894 °C (2.18%) in Tmax and 2.23 °C (72.84%) in ΔTmax compared to the configuration with 0 secondary outlets. By optimizing these parameters, the aim is to enhance BTMS's capabilities, improving LIB (lithium-ion battery) packs' performance and reliability. The optimized structural design parameters proposed in this study yield practical applications that extend beyond theoretical insights, impacting diverse fields reliant on lithium-ion battery technology. Through enhanced thermal management systems, applications in electric vehicles and portable electronics are poised to experience improved performance and longevity. Furthermore, these advancements inform the development of next-generation battery packs, promising reduced overheating risks and extended battery life. Such innovations are critical in energy storage systems for renewable energy applications and electric vehicle technology, facilitating faster charging times and increased driving range. Moreover, the implications extend to aerospace applications, ensuring the reliability of batteries in extreme environmental conditions.",

After successive carbonization and oxidation treatments, hierarchical NiO/Ni nanocrystals covered with a graphene shell were obtained with the hollow ball-in-ball nanostructure intact. The resulting materials exhibited superior performance as the anode in lithium ion batteries (LIBs): they provide high reversible specific capacity (1144 mAh/g), excellent cyclability (nearly no capacity loss after 1000 cycles) and rate performance (805 mAh/g at 15 A/g). In addition, the hierarchical NiO/Ni/Graphene composites demonstrated promising performance as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Such a superior lithium and sodium storage performance is derived from the well-designed hierarchical hollow ball-in-ball structure of NiO/Ni/Graphene composites, which not only mitigates the volume expansion of NiO during the cycles but also provides a continuous highly conductive graphene matrix to facilitate the fast charge transfer and form a stable SEI layer.",

        "abstract": "The growing interest in Na-ion batteries as a “beyond lithium” technologies for energy storage drives the research for high-performance and environment-friendly materials. Na2Ti3O7 (NTO) as an eco-friendly, low-cost anode material shows a very low working potential of 0.3 V vs. Na+/Na but suffers from poor cycling stability, which properties can be significantly influenced by materials synthesis and treatment. Thus, in this work, the influence of the calcination time on the electrochemical performance and the reaction mechanism during cycling were investigated. NTO heat-treated for 48 h at 800 °C (NTO-48h) demonstrated enhanced cycling performance in comparison to NTO heat-treated for only 8 h (NTO-8h). The pristine material was thoroughly characterized by X-ray diffraction, laser granulometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and specific surface area measurements. The reaction mechanisms induced by sodiation/desodiation and cycling were investigated by operando XRD. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to evidence the evolution of the solid electrolyte interface layer (SEI) and modification of charge transfer resistances as well as the influence of cycling on capacity decay. The evolution of the crystallographic structure of NTO-48h revealed a more ordered structure and lower surface contamination compared to NTO-8h. Moreover, the residual Na4Ti3O7 phase detected after the sodium extraction step in NTO-8h seems correlated to the lower electrochemical performance of NTO-8h compared to NTO-48h.",

Recently, a lithium ion battery that uses superconcentrated salt water as its electrolyte has been developed. However, the role of water in facilitating fast ion transport in such highly concentrated electrolyte solutions is not fully understood yet. Here, femtosecond IR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations are used to show that bulk-like water coexists with interfacial water on ion aggregates. We found that dissolved ions form intricate three-dimensional ion-ion networks that are spontaneously intertwined with nanometric water hydrogen-bonding networks. Then, hydrated lithium ions move through bulk-like water channels acting like conducting wires for lithium ion transport. Our experimental and simulation results indicate that water structure-breaking chaotropic anion salts with a high propensity to form ion networks in aqueous solutions would be excellent candidates for water-based LIB electrolytes.

        "title": "Nanotwinned Structure in Copper Affects Lithium Deposition Behavior at Electrolyte-Electrode Interface in Anode-Free Lithium Metal Battery",
        "abstract": "Anode-free lithium metal battery (AFLMB) is one of new promising energy storage systems. In contrast to lithium-ion battery, the negative electrode of AFLMB does not contain any active materials, resulting in a two-fold increase in energy density. As a result, the charging mechanism on the negative electrode in AFLMB is based on electrodeposition of lithium, rather than intercalation of lithium ions. Unfortunately, that causes a series of problems, such as lithium dendrite formation, volume expansion, broken SEI and dead lithium accumulation, leading to the low cycling stability of AFLMB. Consequently, interfacial characteristics of the negative electrode (usually copper) play a critical role in determining the morphology of lithium deposits which largely affects the issues mentioned above. Understanding the mechanism of lithium electrodeposition across the electrode-electrolyte interface is crucial to design a better copper electrode for long-cyclability AFLMB.\n The interfacial characteristics of copper are mainly influenced by crystal phase, surface roughness and defects. While the effects of crystal phase and surface roughness on lithium electrodeposition have been extensively studied, the role of micro-scale defects has been seldom discussed, despite their potential to strongly influence the surface properties of copper. Therefore, this work focuses on elucidating the elementary process about how the defects on copper affect the lithium nucleation and subsequent growth. Specifically, we use (111)-nanotwinned and (111)-preferred orientation copper foils with the same surface roughness to conduct a series of electrochemical measurements. The presence of nanotwin structure can reduce the grain boundary and atomic step density, a type of the defects with high surface energy, on the copper. Before lithium electrodeposition, solvents and anions in an electrolyte adsorb on the electrode-electrolyte interface to form the electric double layer. During this process, the atomic steps with high surface energy on copper can establish strong adsorption with the substance in the electrolyte. The solvents adsorbed on the defects may hinder the reduction of anion. Accordingly, the (111)-nanotwinned Cu foil with fewer defects induces the formation of LiF-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which is beneficial to the transportation of lithium ions. In cyclic voltammetry test, the (111)-nanotwinned Cu foil exhibits higher reduction current density of the precipitation of LiF (Fig. 1).\n For lithium electrodeposition, during the initial stage, lithium adatoms tend to adsorb on the defects with high surface energy on the copper surface, where other adatoms accumulate to form stable nucleus. Subsequently, the nucleus on each nucleation sites might have different growth direction and crystal phase, resulting in a lot of independent lithium grains. In other words, compared to the (111)-preferred orientation substrate, the (111)-nanotwinned Cu foil with less nucleation sites provides more space for the nucleus to grow in 2-D direction, which leads to the lower nucleation overpotential (Fig. 2 a). That result also facilitates the formation of larger lithium grains with smaller surface area exposed to the electrolyte (Fig. 3). As shown in Figure 2 (b), quasi-steady state over-potential of Li plating on the (111)-nanotwinned Cu is generally larger than that on the (111)-preferred orientation Cu foil, which has been ascribed to the high local current density on larger lithium grains. The quasi-steady state overpotential of Li plating on the (111)-preferred orientation Cu foil gradually increased with the cycle number, which might be attributable to the relatively unstable SEI and the accumulation of dead lithium with the GCD cycling. Furthermore, the (111)-nanotwinned Cu foil always exhibits a lower quasi-steady state overpotential of lithium stripping in comparison with the (111)-preferred orientation substrate at each cycle, probably resulting from the uniform Li deposit and the special LiF-rich SEI formation due to the nanotwinned structure. In the cycling stability test (Figure 2 c), for the Cu//Li cell using the (111)-nanotwinned Cu foil, the coulombic efficiency was kept being around 90% in this 160-cycle test. However, for the Cu//Li cell using the (111)-preferred orientation Cu foil, the coulombic efficiency is generally lower than that of the cell using the (111)-nanotwinned Cu foil at the cycle number > 15. In addition, the coulombic efficiency starts to obviously decay at the 135th cycle and becomes lower than 5% at the 160th cycle.\n To sum up, we proposed a mechanism about how the defects affect the reaction at electrode-electrolyte interface. The nanotwinned columnar grains reduces the atomic density on the copper surface, which effectively reduces the formation of lithium dendrite, the accumulation of dead lithium and broken SEI. The (111)-nanotwinned Cu foil is proved to be a superior substrate for lithium deposition and stripping, significantly improving the Li+/Li redox reversibility and cycling stability.\n \n \n \n \n \n Figure 1\n",

        "abstract": "Silicon-based anode fabrication with nanoscale structuration improves the energy density and life cycle of Li-ion batteries. As-synthesized silicon (Si) nanowires (NWs) or nanoparticles (NPs) directly on the current collector represent a credible alternative to conventional graphite anodes. However, the operating potentials of these electrodes are below the electrochemical stability window of all electrolytes used in commercial Li-ion systems. During the first charging phase of the cell, partial decomposition of the electrolyte takes place, which leads to the formation of a layer at the surface of the electrode, called solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). A stable and continuous SEI layer formation is a critical factor to achieve reliable lifetime stability of the battery. Once formed, the SEI acts as a passivation layer that minimizes further degradation of the electrolyte during cycling, while allowing lithium-ion diffusion with their subsequent insertion into the active material and ensuring reversible operation of the electrode. However, one of the major issues requiring deeper investigation is the assessment of the morphological extension of the SEI layer into the active material, which is one of the main parameters affecting the anode performances. In the present study, we use electron tomography with a low electron dose to retrieve three-dimensional information on the SEI layer formation and its stability around SiNWs and SiNPs. The possible mechanisms of SEI evolution could be inferred from the interpretation and analysis of the reconstructed volumes. Significant volume variations in the SiNW and an inhomogeneous distribution of the SEI layer around the NWs are observed during cycling and provide insights into the potential mechanism leading to the generally reported SiNW anode capacity fading. By contrast, analysis of the reconstructed SiNPs' volume for a sample undergoing one lithiation-delithiation cycle shows that the SEI remains homogeneously distributed around the NPs that retain their spherical morphology and points to the potential benefit of such nanoscale Si anode materials to improve their cycling lifetime.",

The magnitude and ratio of contact resistance and compound electronic resistance for LMFP- and NCM-based cathodes are discussed on the basis of the 46-point probe measurement results. The results show that the 46-point probe yields significantly lower resistance values than those in EIS studies.

        "title": "Doped Micron Silicon and Mxene Based Composite Anodes for High-Performance Li-Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "With the world's energy needs constantly increasing, renewable energy sources must be technologically advanced and integrated with energy storage devices to ensure their uninterrupted operation. In recent decades, researchers have devoted substantial efforts to improve the energy density of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) [1]. While graphite remains the commercial anode in LIBs, it’s very low theoretical capacity (372 mAh g-1) restricts its use in high-energy applications. Silicon (Si), owing to its high theoretical capacity of 4200 mAh g-1, natural abundance, and appropriate Li uptake potential (0.4 V vs Li/Li+), is a promising anode material [2]. However, its massive volume expansion restricts its practical use.\n In this study, micron-sized Si particles are combined with graphite. Micron Si is less expensive, and the synthesis process is simpler. The well-ground mixture (Si-G) is mixed with a polymer solution to generate pyrolytic carbon (upon carbonising). This aids in the buffering of mechanical stresses caused by Si volume expansion. Furthermore, direct exposure of Si to the electrolyte is avoided, stabilising the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The addition of a dopant improves the intrinsic conductivity of the material, resulting in increased capacity by providing electron and Li-ion transport channels. To further enhance the composite's performance, synthesized Mxene is added to promote the charge transport between micron Si. Using various techniques such as SEM-EDAX, XRD, Raman, and XPS spectroscopy, the composite's morphology and structure is studied which reveals uniformly distributed Si, C, and Mxene sheets that retain the sheet architecture.\n As an anode, the composite exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance which was evident by its impressive lithium storage specific capacity of 2003 mAh g-1 (based on weight of Si) even after long term cycling (at 1C rate). Additionally, the composite demonstrates superior rate performance with a specific capacity of 2439 mAh g-1 at 10 C rate, highlighting its potential for high-power applications. Moreover, the electrode displayed a low charge transfer impedance and fast electron transport, which improved the electrochemical performance. The reason for this improved performance is the unique structure consisting of Mxene and doping, which significantly increased the Li ion diffusion and the active sites. Also, low-cost micron Si is used which has a high tap density. Thus, this work provides an approach to develop high-capacity LIBs based on silicon.\n \n Keywords: Lithium-ion battery, micron silicon anode, Mxene, doping.\n \n References\n \n \n Liu, L. Kang, J.

Microscopic images show that some nanoislands were formed on the surface, which enlarged the surface area. Consequently, the NH4F-modified Li4Ti5O12 material exhibited significantly enhanced capacities and rate capabilities, even at low temperatures. The discharge capacity was increased from 149 to 167 mA h g-1 at 1 C, and the capacity retention was increased from 17.8 to 52.0% at 15 C. The capacity retention of NH4F-modified Li4Ti5O12 was greater than that of Li4Ti5O12 at each low-temperature point. Additionally, the introduction of F can protect the Li4Ti5O12 material from side reactions with the electrolyte and the atmosphere, enhancing the surface stability and reducing the release of gaseous products. It is believed that the NH4F-modified Li4Ti5O12 with enhanced electrochemical performance is a promising anode material for lithium ion batteries. Furthermore, this facile surface fluorination strategy is amenable to large-scale production.",

        "abstract": "Using electron beam lithography, amorphous Si (a-Si) nanopillars were fabricated with a height of 100 nm and diameters of 100, 200, 300, 500, and 1000 nm. The nanopillars were electrochemically cycled in a 1 M lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate in propylene carbonate electrolyte. In situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to qualitatively and quantitatively examine the morphology evolution of the nanopillars including volume and height changes versus voltage in real-time. In the first cycle, an obvious hysteresis of volume change versus voltage during lithiation and delithiation was measured. The pillars did not crack in the first cycle, but a permanent volume expansion was observed. During subsequent cycles the a-Si roughened and deformed from the initial geometry, and eventually pillars with diameters >200 nm fractured. Furthermore, a degradation of mechanical properties is suggested as the 100 and 200 nm pillars were mechanically eroded by the small contact forces under the AFM probe. Ex situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, combined with analysis of the damage caused by in situ AFM imaging, demonstrate that during cycling, the silicon became porous and structurally unstable compared to as-fabricated pillars. This research highlights that even nanoscale a-Si suffers irreversible mechanical damage during cycling in organic electrolytes.",

Surface engineering is an effective strategy for improving a cathode's cycling stability, but most reported surface coatings cannot adapt to the dynamic volume changes of cathodes. Herein, a self‐adaptive polymer (polyrotaxane‐co‐poly(acrylic acid)) interfacial layer is built on LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2. The polymer layer with a slide‐ring structure exhibits high toughness and can withstand the stress caused by particle volume changes, which can prevent the cracking of particles. In addition, the slide‐ring polymer acts as a physicochemical barrier that suppresses surface side reactions and alleviates the dissolution of transition metallic ions, which ensures stable cycling performance. Thus, the as‐prepared cathode shows significantly improved long‐term cycling stability in situations in which cracks may easily occur, especially under high‐rate, high‐voltage, and high‐temperature conditions.",

The coated material containing 12 wt.% of spinel demonstrates a significantly improved first cycle Coulombic efficiency of 92% with a high first cycle discharge capacity of 290 mAhg−1.

Next, we observed that the redox properties of the quinone derivatives can be tuned in the desired direction by systematically modifying their chemical structures using electron-withdrawing functional groups. Further, DFT-based investigations of the redox potentials of the Li-bound quinone derivatives provide insights regarding the changes induced in their redox properties during the discharging process. The redox potential decreases as the number of bound Li atoms is increased. However, we found that the functionalization of the quinone derivatives with carboxylic acids can improve their redox potential as well as their charge capacity.

        "abstract": "Accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries is essential for enhancing energy management and extending the lifespan of batteries across various industries. However, the raw capacity data of these batteries is often noisy and exhibits complex nonlinear degradation patterns, especially due to capacity regeneration phenomena during operation, making precise RUL prediction a significant challenge. Although various deep learning-based methods have been proposed, their performance relies heavily on the availability of large datasets, and satisfactory prediction accuracy is often achievable only with extensive training samples. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method that integrates sequence decomposition algorithms with an optimized neural network. Specifically, the Complementary Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) algorithm is employed to decompose the raw capacity data, effectively mitigating the noise from capacity regeneration. Subsequently, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) model. The final BiGRU-based prediction model was extensively tested on eight lithium-ion battery datasets from NASA and CALCE, demonstrating robust generalization capability, even with limited data. The experimental results indicate that the CEEMDAN-PSO-BiGRU model can reliably and accurately predict the RUL and capacity of lithium-ion batteries, providing a promising and reliable method for RUL prediction in practical applications.",

NMP is a strongly polar aprotic solvent that effectively dissolves the polyvinylidene difluoride binder. While the majority of NMP typically evaporates during the electrode baking process, trace amounts may persist, particularly in positive electrodes containing nano-sized and highly-porous active materials. We noted residual NMP in the positive electrodes of Li-ion pouch cells containing LiMn0.8Fe0.2PO4 due to the extremely high surface area of the material and we wanted to determine the impact of this residual NMP. Therefore, a control electrolyte was purposely spiked with varying amounts of NMP and used in NMC532/graphite pouch cells to investigate the impact of residual NMP on lithium-ion battery performance. Experimental results indicate that NMP has the potential not only to neutralize the electrolyte additive ethylene sulfate but also to independently increase cathode impedance, leading to a higher rate of capacity loss during charge-discharge cycling. It is crucial to establish the appropriate procedure for baking electrodes containing NMP, both in laboratory and industrial settings, to mitigate these effects.",

Here we analyze the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on binder-free silicon nanowire (SiNW) electrodes in pure FEC or VC electrolytes containing 1 M LiPF6 by solid-state NMR with and without dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) enhancement. We find that the polymeric SEIs formed in pure FEC or VC electrolytes consist mainly of cross-linked poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and aliphatic chain functionalities along with additional carbonate and carboxylate species. The formation of branched fragments is further confirmed by 13C-13C correlation NMR experiments. The presence of cross-linked PEO-type polymers in FEC and VC correlates with good capacity retention and high Coulombic efficiencies of the SiNWs. Using 29Si DNP NMR, we are able to probe the interfacial region between SEI and the Si surface for the first time with NMR spectroscopy. Organosiloxanes form upon cycling, confirming that some of the organic SEI is covalently bonded to the Si surface.

        "abstract": "Lithium-ion battery electrodes have a multilayered structure consisting of active porous electrode materials coated on one or both sides of a thin metal current collector. The porosity and tortuosity of the active materials play a vital role in determining the battery's performance metrics, such as energy density and power density. However, existing methods for quantifying these parameters are often limited and cannot be easily applied in a production environment. In this work, we propose two ultrasonic methods based on a newly developed stiffness matrix theory [1] to achieve in-production quantification. The first method establishes a quantitative relationship to link angled ultrasound transmission to the porous parameters of electrodes. This relationship is then used to inversely determine porosity and tortuosity from ultrasonic transmission measurements using a non-contact, air-coupled setup. From the first method, we observe that ultrasound is highly transmissible as guided wave modes are excited in electrodes. Based on this phenomenon, our second method directly excites guided waves in the layers using electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs), enabling us to obtain more accurate measurements with a better signal-to-noise ratio. Both methods have demonstrated good sensitivity to porosity and tortuosity, thus providing accurate quantification using ultrasonic transmission and guided wave results. We anticipate that our methods have the potential to provide real-time online characterization of electrodes during production, which would enable closed-loop control of the manufacturing processes and thus dramatically reduce wastage and improve product quality.\n \n Reference\n \n [1] M.

        "abstract": "The use of conventional fuels such from fossils sourced is non-renewable energy, which makes this energy source less environmentally friendly. The battery that is nowadays used widely is the Lithium-Ion type with variations in the type of electrode. Electrodes have an important role in battery performance, especially at the cathode. Predecessor cathode types such as LiCoO2, LiMnO, and LiNiCo have various disadvantages due to their dangerous nature, insufficient capacity, and poor stability. NMC cathode (NiMnCo), in this case, NMC541 is presented to overcome these deficiencies. The process of making NMC541 cathode can be done by various synthesis methods, one of which is Co-precipitation. The synthesis parameter directly influences the performance of the cathode precursor produced, especially on its microstructure. For that, we try to optimize the synthesis parameters, such as Stirring Speed, and Aging time. The result said that samples with 900 Rpm stirring speed give the best product precursor along to their small size particle and good conductivity. Meanwhile, Aging co-precipitation doesn’t significantly affect coprecipitation precursor products.",

        "abstract": "Phase engineering of the electrode materials in terms of designing heterostructures, introducing heteroatom and defects, improves great prospects in accelerating the charge storage kinetics during the repeated Li + /Na + insertion/deintercalation. Herein, a new design of Li/Na-ion battery anodes through phase regulating is reported consisting of F doped SnO 2 -SnS 2 heterostructures nanocrystals with oxygen/sulfur vacancies (V O /V S ) anchored on 2D sulfur/nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide matrix (F-SnO 2-x -SnS 2-x @N/S-RGO). Consequently, F-SnO 2-x -SnS 2-x @N/S-RGO anode demonstrates superb high reversible capacity and long-term cycling stability. Moreover, it exhibits excellent great rate capability with 589 mAh g -1 for Li + and 296 mAh g -1 at 5 A g -1 for Na + . The enhanced Li/Na storage properties of the nanocomposites are not only attributed to the increase in conductivity caused by V O /V S and F doping (confirmed by DFT calculations) to accelerate their charge-transfer kinetics but also the increased interaction between F-SnO 2-x -SnS 2-x and Li/Na through heterostructure. Meanwhile, the hierarchical F-SnO 2-x -SnS 2-x @N/S-RGO network structure enables fast infiltration of electrolyte and improves electron/ion transportation in the electrode, and the corrosion resistance of F doping contributes to prolonged cycle stability.",

        "abstract": "Carbon-coated olivine NaFePO(4) (C-NaFePO(4)) spherical particles with a uniform diameter of ∼80 nm are obtained by chemical delithiation and subsequent electrochemical sodiation of carbon-coated olivine LiFePO(4) (C-LiFePO(4)), which is synthesized by a solvothermal method. The C-NaFePO(4) electrodes are identical (particle size, particle size distribution, surface coating, and active material loading, etc.) to C-LiFePO(4) except that Li ions in C-LiFePO(4) are replaced by Na ions, making them ideal for comparison of thermodynamics and kinetics between C-NaFePO(4) cathode in sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries and C-LiFePO(4) in lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. In this paper, the equilibrium potentials, reaction resistances, and diffusion coefficient of Na in C-NaFePO(4) are systematically investigated by using the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV), and compared to those of the well-known LiFePO(4) cathodes in Li-ion batteries. Due to the lower diffusion coefficient of Na-ion and higher contact and charge transfer resistances in NaFePO(4) cathodes, the rate performance of C-NaFePO(4) in Na-ion batteries is much worse than that of C-LiFePO(4) in Li-ion batteries. However, the cycling stability of C-NaFePO(4) is almost comparable to C-LiFePO(4) by retaining 90% of its capacity even after 100 charge-discharge cycles at a charge-discharge rate of 0.1 C.",

However, its intermittent nature necessitates external energy storage solutions, which can often be expensive, bulky, and associated with energy conversion losses. This study introduces the concept of a photo-accelerated battery that seamlessly integrates energy harvesting and storage functions within a single device. In this research, a novel approach for crafting photocathodes is presented using hydrogenated vanadium pentoxide (H:V2 O5 ) nanofibers. This method enhances optical activity, electronic conductivity, and ion diffusion rates within photo-accelerated Li-ion batteries. This study findings reveal that H:V2 O5 exhibits notable improvements in specific capacity under both dark and illuminated conditions. Furthermore, it demonstrates enhanced diffusion kinetics and charge storage performance when exposed to light, as compared to pristine counterparts. This strategy of defect engineering holds great promise for the development of high-performance photocathodes in future energy storage applications.",

As a strategy to improve thermal stability of LIBs, here, we report on nitrile-based molecular coverage on surface of cathode active materials to block or suppress thermally accelerated side reactions between electrode and electrolyte. Two different series of aliphatic nitriles were introduced as an additive into a carbonate-based electrolyte: di-nitriles (CN-[CH2]n-CN with n = 2, 5, and 10) and mono-nitriles (CH3-[CH2]m-CN with m = 2, 5, and 10). On the basis of the strong interaction between the electronegativity of nitrile functional groups and the electropositivity of cobalt in LiCoO2 cathode, aliphatic mono- and di-nitrile molecules improved the thermal stability of lithium ion cells by efficiently protecting the surface of LiCoO2. Three factors, the surface coverage θ, the steric hindrance of aliphatic moiety within nitrile molecule, and the chain polarity, mainly affect thermal tolerance as well as cell performances at elevated temperature.",

        "abstract": "The intricate lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttle and uncontrollable lithium dendrite growth critically hinder the commercialization of lithium−sulfur (Li−S) batteries. The rational and orderly assignment of multi‐electron induced flow is the critical link in sulfer redox reaction. Herein, the yolk‐shell Fe3O4/FeP@C heterostructure nanoreactors are fabricated to modulate electronic structure, including spin‐related charge behavior and orbital orientation control, which can demonstrate the interaction between catalytic activity and spin‐state conformation. The orbital spin splitting of Fe3O4/FeP@C induces the electron transition from low‐spin to high‐spin, where the non‐degenerate orbitals contribute to energy level up‐shift, guiding electron migration from FeP to Fe3O4, and activating more electronic states in 3d orbitals. Spin polarization guides electron flow and induces sulfur closed‐loop conversion, which are confirmed by DFT simulations and in situ Raman. Hence, the electrochemical performances are remarkable at ultra‐high current density and sulfur loading. Even an initial specific capacity of 928.5 mAh g−1 of a Li−S pouch cell reveals the practical prospect of Fe3O4/FeP@C/PP separator. The Li//Li symmetric cell cycles steadily for 4000 h, confirming the interlayer simultaneously promotes sulfur evolution kinetics and sieves lithium ions. This work deciphers the principles of spin‐orbit coupling, achieving the topological modulation of “charge−spin−orbit” toward electrocatalysts.",

Herein, a direct repairing method for degraded LiCoO2 using a LiCl–CH4N2O deep eutectic solvent (DES) was established. The DES is not used to dissolve LiCoO2 but directly serves as a carrier for the selective replenishment of lithium and cobalt. Replenishment of lithium restores LiCoO2 at different states of charge to a capacity of 130 mAh/g (at 0.1 C rate), while replenishing the cobalt increases the capacity retention rate of 90% after 100 cycles, which is comparable to pristine LiCoO2. The DES is collected and reused multiple times with a high repair efficiency. This process reduces energy consumption by 37.1% and greenhouse gas emissions by 34.8% compared with the current production process of LiCoO2, demonstrating excellent environmental and economic viability.",

This has necessitated estimating the capacity of lithium-ion batteries in various situations. In this study, a capacity estimation algorithm using multilayer perceptron under different aging states and ambient temperature is proposed. The proposed algorithm estimates the capacity using charging time, voltage, and surface temperature, which can be measured during constant-current charging. Particularly, the surface temperature represents the state of battery differently than voltage. Therefore, the problem that the existing algorithm required a state of charge estimation was addressed, and the size of the neural network was significantly reduced. Using experimental data to validate the proposed algorithm, it was confirmed that the capacity was well estimated with a mean absolute error of 0.38% and a maximum error of 0.83%.",

Inspired by the oft-cited connection between a soft anion lattice and ionic transport, this work aims to provide evidence on how changing the polarizability of the anion sublattice in one structure affects ionic transport. Here, we systematically alter the anion framework polarizability of the superionic argyrodites Li6PS5X by controlling the fractional occupancy of the halide anions (X = Cl, Br, I). Ultrasonic speed of sound measurements are used to quantify the variation in the lattice stiffness and Debye frequencies. In combination with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and neutron diffraction, these results show that the lattice softness has a striking influence on the ionic transport: the softer bonds lower the activation barrier and simultaneously decrease the prefactor of the moving ion. Due to the contradicting influence of these parameters on ionic conductivity, we find that it is necessary to tailor the lattice stiffness of materials in order to obtain an optimum ionic conductivity.",

In contrast to the literature (e.g., using a cheap supply of lithium other than lithium hydroxide and acetate), lithium carbonate was used as lithium source in this study. Owing in part to the higher stability of lithium carbonate at lower temperatures, short-range ordered surface presence was seen during the high voltage cycling process.

        "abstract": "Herein, a novel hybrid S@MnO2@C nanosphere, comprising sulfur nanoparticles encapsulated by a MnO2@C hollow dual-shell, is reported. Benefiting from a conductive C outer layer, the S@MnO2@C hybrid nanosphere provided highly efficient pathways for fast electron/ion transfer and sufficient free space for the expansion of the encapsulated sulfur nanoparticles. Moreover, the dual-shell composed of a MnO2 inner layer and a C outer layer coating on S not only improved the efficacious encapsulation of sulfur, but also significantly suppressed the dissolution of polysulfides during cycling. As a result, the S@MnO2@C electrode shows high capacity, high coulombic efficiency and excellent cycling stability. The S@MnO2@C cathode delivered a discharge capacity of 593 mA h g−1 in the fourth cycle and was able to maintain 573 mA h g−1 after 100 charge–discharge cycles at 1.0C, corresponding to a capacity retention of 96.6%.",

        "abstract": "Collagen hydrolysate can stabilize Zn and Li electrodeposition in metal ion batteries. Lithium (Li) or zinc (Zn) metal anodes have attracted interest for battery research due to their high theoretical capacities and low redox potentials. However, uncontrollable dendrite growth, especially under high current (>4 mA cm−2), precludes reversable cycling in Li or Zn metal batteries with a high-loading (>4 mAh cm−2), precludes reversable cycling in Li or Zn metal batteries with high-loading (>4 mAh cm−2) cathode. We report a cation regulation mechanism to address this failure. Collagen hydrolysate coated on absorbed glass mat (CH@AGM) can simultaneously induce a deionization shock inside the separator and spread cations on the anode to promote uniform electrodeposition. Employing 24 mAh cm−2 cathodes, Li and Zn metal batteries with CH@AGM delivered 600 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of 99.7%. In comparison, pristine Li and Zn metal batteries only survive for 10 and 100 cycles, respectively. This approach enabled 400 cycles in a 200 Ah-class Zn metal battery, which suggests a scalable method to achieve dendrite-free anodes in various batteries.",

        "abstract": "Searching for electrode materials for non-lithium metal ion batteries (NLMIBs) is key to the success of NLMIBs. In this work, we investigated the scientific feasibility of using g-Mg3N2, which is a novel 2D graphene-like material, as an anode for non-lithium metal-ions (Na, K, Mg, Ca and Al) batteries based on density functional theory calculations. The sequential adsorption energy, Bader charge, intercalation voltage, energy-storage capacity, electronic conductivity and metal-ion diffusion energy barrier are calculated. Results show that the metal-ion intercalation potentials and diffusion energy barriers are suitable for battery application. The maximum specific capacities for Na-, K-, Mg-, Ca- and Al-ion on g-Mg3N2 are predicted to be 797, 797, 531, 1594 and 797 mA h g−1, respectively. The excellent structural stability of g-Mg3N2 is good for the cycling performance. Moreover, the electronic structure of the g-Mg3N2 changes from semiconductor to metal upon metal-ion adsorption, as well as relatively low metal-ion diffusion energy barriers (except for Al-ion diffusion), are beneficial to the charge/discharge rate of the g-Mg3N2 anode.",

        "abstract": "Utilizing hyper‐lithiated materials can offer a variety of options for designing high‐energy lithium‐ion batteries. As sacrificial cathodes, they compensate for the initial loss of Li+ at the anode. During the first delithiation process, a Fe‐substituted Li6CoO4 (Li5.7Co0.7Fe0.3O4) supplies a large amount of Li+. Especially, the peroxide species formation and oxygen evolution are suppressed even though the charge compensation of oxygen is facilitated in Li5.7Co0.7Fe0.3O4. From a structural viewpoint, the anti‐fluorite structure changes to defective disordered phases during the Li+ extraction, and the proportion of the electrochemical‐inactive phase is more dominant in the case of Li5.7Co0.7Fe0.3O4 at the end of the charge. Consequently, the delithiated LixCo0.7Fe0.3O4 is deactivated in subsequent cycles, reducing unexpected electrochemical reactions after the Li+ provision as sacrificial cathodes. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism of hyper‐lithiated materials and represent a significant step forward in developing high‐performance sacrificial cathodes.",

The stabilized performance is attained by an on-site fluorination strategy, using BiF3 for the interfacial coating of the anode. Unlike previously reported LiF protective coating derived from the vapor/solution depositions, BiF3 nanocrystals would be lithiated on-site to the anode surface and server as the protective layer. The chemically inertial Li3Bi alloy can provide additional ion-conductive paths and stitch the LiF to form a seamless protective layer, thereby suppressing the dendrite propagation and parasitic reactions effectively. With the designed anode structures and compositions, the high-loading full battery (8.05 mg cm-2) can achieve an exceptional utilization of both sulfur (898 mAh gS-1) and lithium (1533 mAh gLi-1) over 200 cycles, marking a step toward cyclable Li metal batteries at a high capacity.",

        "abstract": "Lithium-oxygen batteries (LOBs) possess the highest theoretical specific density among all types of lithium batteries, making them ideal candidates to replace the current Li ion batteries for next-generation electric vehicle applications. However, designing highly active catalysts with high electronic conductivities to kinetically accelerate the sluggish oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER) is still a big challenge. This work was dedicated to developing two-dimensional (2D) trigonal phase MoS2 (1T-MoS2) nanosheets as a highly active electrocatalyst for LOBs for the first time. Metallic 1T-MoS2 prepared via in situ liquid-redox intercalation and exfoliation was hybridized with functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to form freestanding, binder-free oxygen electrodes. The 1T-MoS2/CNT electrode exhibited excellent electrochemical performances with a high reversible capacity of 500 mA h g-1 at a current density of 200 mA g-1 for more than 100 cycles owing to the catalytically active surfaces of 1T-MoS2 accessible by Li+ ions and O2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations identified the catalytically active basal planes in 1T-MoS2 during the ORR as well as the initial ORR path during LOB cycles. The results based on the rotational ring disk electrode (RRDE) experiments also supported the findings from the DFT calculations, where the 1T-MoS2 basal planes are active for both the ORR and OER, not the semiconducting hexagonal MoS2 (2H-MoS2) whose edges are only electrocatalytically active. This study sheds light on the use of metallic 1T-MoS2 as a multifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for LOB applications with enhanced ORR and OER activities.",

Herein, 1 nm-thin Ni3CoOx (1 nm-NCO) nanosheets synthesized through isomorphic transformation of NiCo layered double hydroxides within a two-dimensional (2D)-SiO2 envelope are chosen. The interconversion of metal/metal-oxide NCs under redox-switching thermal treatment, while retaining reversibility, inspired the accomplishment of identical consequences under the harsh operational conditions of LIB redox cycles by application of the thin-NCO-defined 2D nanospace. During charge/discharge cycles, 1 nm-NCO covered with an in situ formed solid-electrolyte-interphase layer enables fully reversible interconversion between the reactive NC redox pairs, as evidenced by detailed morphological and electrochemical analyses, thus providing high-rate capability with a specific capacity of 61.2% at 5.0 C relative to 0.2 C, outstanding cycle stability delivering a reversible capacity of 1169 mAh g-1, and 913 mAh g-1 with high average Coulombic efficiency (>99.2%) at 3.0 and 5.0 C for 1000 cycles, respectively, which has not been achieved with other transition-metal oxides. Such a nanospace-confinement effect on sustainability of reactive NCs to follow-up a highly reversible conversion reaction at fast charging in LIBs is operative within a slit-like ultrathin 2D nanogap from 1 nm-NCO only, as a relatively thicker 7 nm-NCO anode, with accompanying larger space available, has evidenced poor reversibility of NCs and inadequate cyclic stability under potential high-power density LIB application.",

Compatibility of the supercapacitor voltage range with the MRI system must also be considered. We present a detailed analysis of power duty profiles in MRI, using actual imaging sequences, that has not been reported previously.

        "abstract": "The pursuit of high energy densities propels the design of next-generation nickel-based layered oxide cathodes. The utilization of low-cobalt, ultrahigh-nickel layered oxide cathodes, and the extension of operating voltages promise enhanced energy density. However, stability and safety face challenges associated with nickel content, including structural degradation, lattice oxygen evolution, and thermal instability. In this study, a promising strategy of Al and Nb dual-bulk-doping is presented in high-Ni cathode materials of LiNi0.96Co0.04O2 (NC) to stabilize the bulk structure, suppress oxygen release, and attain superior electrochemical performance at high voltages. The introduction of Al and Nb effectively raises the migration energy of Ni2+ into Li sites and stabilizes lattice oxygen through strengthened Al─O and Nb─O bonds. Furthermore, the substitution of high-valence Nb ions reduces the charge depletion of lattice oxygen and induces an ordered microstructure. The Al and Nb dual-bulk-doping strategy mitigates strain and stress associated with the H2↔H3 phase transition, reducing the generation and propagation of microcracks. The resulting Li(Ni0.96Co0.04)0.985Al0.01Nb0.005O2 (NCAN) cathode exhibits superior cycling stability, with a capacity retention of 77.8% after 300 cycles, even when operating at a high-voltage of 4.4 V, outperforming the NC (48.5%).

Herein, the hollow porous hexagonal prism shaped C-In2-xCoxO3 composite is synthesized to restrain the shuttle effect and accelerate reaction kinetics of LPSs. The novel hexagonal prism porous carbon skeleton not only provides a stable physical framework for sulfur active materials but also facilitates efficient electron transferring and lithium ion diffusion. Meanwhile, the polar In2-xCoxO3 is equipped with strong adsorption capacity for LPSs, which is confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, helping to anchor LPSs. More importantly, the doping of Co regulates the electronic structure environment of In2O3, expedites the electron transmission, and bidirectionally improves the catalytic conversion ability of LPSs and nucleation-decomposition of Li2S. Benefiting from the above advantages, the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries has been greatly enhanced. Therefore, the C-In2-xCoxO3 cathode presents a good rate performance, which exhibits a low-capacity fading rate of 0.052% per cycle over 800 cycles at 5 C.

        "abstract": "The strategic design of the cathode is a critical feature for high-performance and long-lasting reversibility of an energy storage system. In particular, the round-trip efficiency and cycling performance of nonaqueous lithium–oxygen batteries are governed by minimizing the discharge products, such as Li2O and Li2O2. Recently, a metal–organic framework has been directly pyrolyzed into a carbon frame with controllable pore volume and size. Furthermore, selective metallic catalysts can also be obtained by adjusting metal ions for outstanding electrochemical reactions. In this study, various bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)-derived carbons were designed by varying the ratio of Zn to Co ions. Moreover, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are added to improve the electrical conductivity further, ultimately leading to better electrochemical stability in the cathode. As a result, the optimized bimetallic ZIF–carbon/CNT composite exhibits a high discharge capacity of 16,000 mAh·g−1, with a stable cycling performance of up to 137 cycles. This feature is also beneficial for lowering the overpotential of the cathode during cycling, even at the high current density of 2,000 mA·g−1.",

        "abstract": "Concerns over fuel scarcity and environmental degradation largely drive the increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs). Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), known for their high energy and power densities, are the favored power source for EVs. Over the past few decades, research has been concentrated on ensuring these batteries operate efficiently, safely, and reliably. A key issue impacting the safety of Li-ion batteries is thermal runaway (TR), which can lead to hazardous battery fires. Internal short circuits (ISCs) are often the primary cause of these TR incidents, making the early detection of spontaneous ISC formation a pivotal diagnostic task. This research introduces an innovative ISC detection technique for cylindrical Li-ion battery cells. This technique is based on the augmentation of the model state vector in an extended Kalman filter (EKF), combining both classical voltage measurements to surface temperature observations. This framework enables real-time estimation of the internal ISC state while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed method is tested numerically considering a high-fidelity numerical plant cycled using charge-depleting tests that mimic a practical battery cell working cycle at various C rates and at different ambient temperatures to account for both load and environmental uncertainties. The results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the method. In addition, the method has been proven to be computationally efficient, demonstrating the feasibility of its real-time implementation.",

The Er2O3 phase is precipitated from the bulk of the LNCMO material and encapsulated onto its entire surface during the calcining process. Electrochemicial performance is investigated by a galvanostatic charge and discharge test. The structure and morphology are characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The results show that an about 10 nm Er2O3 layer is successfully encapsulated onto the entire surface of the LNCMO matrix material. This unique nanoscale Er2O3 encapsulation can significantly prevent the LNCMO cathode material from being corroded by electrolytes and stabilize the crystal structure of the LNCMO cathode during cycling. Therefore, the prepared Er2O3-coated LNCMO composite exhibits excellent cycling performace and a high initial Coulombic efficiency.",

        "abstract": "The aging process of lithium-ion batteries is an extremely complex process, and the prediction of the calendar life of the lithium-ion battery is important to further guide battery maintenance, extend the battery life and reduce the risk of battery use. In the uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system, the battery is in a floating state for a long time, so the aging of the battery is approximated by calendar aging, and its decay rate is slow and difficult to estimate accurately. This paper proposes a particle filtering-based algorithm for battery state-of-health (SOH) and remaining useful life (RUL) predictions. First, the calendar aging modeling for the batteries used in the UPS system for the Shanghai rail transportation energy storage power station is presented. Then, the particle filtering algorithm is employed for the SOH estimation and RUL prediction for the single-cell battery calendar aging model. Finally, the single-cell SOH and RUL estimation algorithm is expanded to the pack and group scales estimation. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can achieve accurate SOH estimation and RUL prediction results.",

        "abstract": "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to investigate how the content and type of co-solvents influence the solvation structure and transport properties of lithium ions (Li+) in electrolytes. Our focus was on lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) at a concentration of 1.0 M in a carbonate-based solvent composed of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) with a 1:1 mixing ratio. Low-volatility co-solvents, including tetramethylene sulfone (TMS), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), and succinonitrile (SN), were introduced into the electrolytic matrix at concentrations of 0, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 wt.%. Li+ dynamics were notably influenced by these factors. The highest Li+ transference number was observed at a 25 wt.% concentration for each co-solvent, particularly with 25 wt.% DMSO, resulting in the highest ionic conductivity (14.13 mS/cm) and Li+ transference number (0.47). In this system, the PF6\n - anion refrains from joining the initial solvation shell of Li+. This is attributed to the higher donor number of DMSO compared to TMS, FEC, and SN, leading to a weakening of electrostatic interactions. These findings advance our comprehension of electrochemical principles in bulk electrolytes, providing insights for designing safer and more efficient lithium-ion batteries.",

Immersion of NMC powder in water leads to both structural modification of the particles surface as observed by high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and the formation of lithium-based compounds over the surface (LiOH, Li2CO3) in greater amount than after long-time exposure to ambient air, as confirmed by pH titration and 7Li MAS NMR analysis. The surface compounds adversely affect the electrochemical performance and are notably responsible for the alkaline pH of the aqueous slurry, which causes corrosion of the aluminum collector during coating of the electrode. The corrosion is avoided by adding phosphoric acid to the slurry as it lowers the pH, and it also enhances the cycling stability of the water-based electrodes due to the phosphate compounds formed at the particles surface, as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis.",

        "abstract": "Transition-metal chalcogenides (TMCs) can be used either as intercalation cathodes or as conversion-type anodes for lithium ion batteries, for which two distinctively different lithiation reaction mechanisms govern the electrochemical performance of TMCs. However, the factors that control the transition of lithiation mechanisms remain elusive. In this work, we investigated the lithiation process of NbSe3 ribbons using in situ transmission electron microscopy and observed a size-dependent transition from intercalation to the conversion reaction. Large NbSe3 ribbons can accommodate high concentrations of Li(+) through intercalation by relaxing their internal spacing, while lithiation of small NbSe3 ribbons proceeds readily to full conversion. We found that the size-dependent variation of the lithiation mechanism is associated with both Li(+) diffusion in NbSe3 and the accommodation of newly formed phases. For large NbSe3 ribbons, the intercalation-to-conversion transition is impeded by both long-range Li(+) diffusion and large-scale accommodation of volume expansion induced by the formation of new phases. These results demonstrate the inherent structural instability of NbSe3 as an intercalation cathode and its high lithiation rate as a promising conversion-type anode.",

However, searching for suitable anode materials with high-rate and stable cycling performance is still needed to promote their practical application. Herein, three-dimensional Na2Ti3O7 nanowire arrays with enriched surface vacancies endowed by phosphorus doping are reported. When evaluated as anodes for sodium-ion batteries, the electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 290 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C, good rate capability (50 mAh g-1 at 20 C), and stable cycling capability (98% capacity retention over 3100 cycles at 20 C). The superior electrochemical performance is attributed to the synergistic effects of the unique nanowire arrays and phosphorus doping. The rational structures can provide convenient channels to facilitate ions/electrons transport and improve the capacitive contributions. Moreover, the phosphorus-doping-induced surface vacancies not only provide more active sites but also improve the intrinsic electrical conductivity of Na2Ti3O7, which will enable the electrode materials with excellent sodium storage performance.

        "abstract": "We have developed electrospinning-based manufacturing capability for dendrite-free anode-free and anode-less batteries. Electrospinning is a widely used, feasible manufacturing approach to create nano- and micro-porous layers of functional fibers. By tailoring fiber compositions, the electrospun layers can afford a wide variety of functionalities applicable to biomedical templates, separation membranes, and energy storage. Its manufacturing capability is, however, limited to producing randomly oriented fibrous structures. Topology and tortuosity of the electrospun fibrous layers are poorly controlled, making it difficult to systematically investigate structure-property relationships for any given applications, especially electrochemical systems.\n In this presentation, we will demonstrate how to improve the controllability of fiber construction geometry by electrospinning. Unlike conventional electrospinning, our approach employs a mobile stage that allows precise alignment of fibers. Produced fibrous structures will be used to construct current collectors of the anode-free batteries, one of the proposed beyond-lithium (Li)-ion battery systems for high energy density. While direct, yet reversible, Li plating and stripping on and from the current collector has proven difficult due to uncontrolled dendrite growth, we found that the flat copper foil reinforced by the three-dimensional fibrous structure can enhance Li storage efficiency over an extended number of cycles, outperforming the planar case. We will discuss the effect of fiber compositions and controlled geometrical configurations on stabilizing Li plating and stripping morphologies to suppress Li dendrite growth and provide a fundamental design principle to construct anode-free and anode-less battery cells. Battery manufacturing advanced by this work will offer a systematic strategy to develop next-generation energy storage systems for a sustainable energy future.",

Additionally, polar polymer chains consisting of polyethersulfone and polyvinylidene customize the highly aggregated solvation structure of electrolytes via substantial solvent immobilization, facilitating ion‐conductivity‐enhanced inorganic‐rich solid‐electrolyte interphase with remarkable interface endurance. With the reliable mechanical strength of the separator, the assembled sodium‐ion full cell delivers significantly improved energy density and high safety, enabling stable operation under cutting and rolling.

        "abstract": "Organic materials are promising candidates for future rechargeable batteries, owing to their high natural abundance and rapidly redox reaction. Elaborating the charge/discharge process of organic electrode is critical to unveil the fundamental redox mechanism of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), but monitoring of this process is still challenging. Here, we report a nondestructive electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique to real-time detect the electron migration step within polyimide cathode. From in situ EPR tests, we vividly observe a classical redox reaction along with two-electron transfer which only shows one pair of peaks in the cyclic voltammetry curve. The radical anion and dianion intermediates are detailed delineation at redox sites in EPR spectra, which can be further confirmed through density functional theory calculations. This approach is especially crucial to elaborate the correlation behind electrochemical and molecular structure for multistep organic-based LIBs.",

        "abstract": "Commonly used lithium‐ion battery on‐board charger (OBC) for electric vehicles (EVs) needs a wide output voltage range, but the traditional LLC converter is hard to meet the need under the condition of high efficiency and high power density. In this paper, a resonant converter with hybrid modulation is proposed. The converter has a relatively simple topology and control method. Compared with the traditional LLC topology, only two diodes are replaced by MOSFETs on the secondary side of the transformer, and no auxiliary components are added. The primary‐side switches adopt PFM) and the secondary‐side switches adopt short‐circuit control in the proposed converter, which can realize a wide output voltage range, in a narrow switching frequency range with excellent soft‐switching performance. The proposed converter can effectively reduce the resonant current and the volume of transformer core and achieve energy delivery with high power density and high efficiency. The operation principles, voltage gain, and soft‐switching conditions of the converter are analyzed in this paper. Finally, a 3.3‐kW SiC‐based prototype with 400‐V input and 250‐ to 430‐V output is built to verify the feasibility and validity of the proposed converter.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel hybrid thermal management strategy, which uses secondary coolants (air and fluid) to extract heat from a phase change material (paraffin), resulting in an increase in the phase change material’s heat extraction capability and the battery module’s overall thermal performance. A novel cold plate design is developed and placed between the rows and columns of the cells. The cold plate contains a single fluid body to improve the thermal performance of the battery module. Experimental studies were conducted to obtain the temperature and heat flux profiles of the battery module. Moreover, a numerical model is developed and validated using the experimental data obtained. The numerical data stayed within ±2% of the experimental data. In addition, the ability of nanoparticles to increase the thermal conductivity of water is examined and it is found that the cooling from the liquid cooling component is not sensitive enough to capture the 0.32 W/m K increase in the thermal conductivity of the fluid. Furthermore, in order to enhance the air cooling, fins were added within the air duct to the cold plate. However, this is not feasible, as the pressure drop through the addition of the fins increased by ~245%, whereas the maximum temperature of the battery module reduced by only 0.6 K. Finally, when scaled up to an entire battery pack at a high discharge rate of 7 C, the numerical results showed that the overall temperature uniformity across the pack was 1.14 K, with a maximum temperature of 302.6 K, which was within the optimal operating temperature and uniformity ranges. Therefore, the developed thermal management strategy eliminates the requirement of a pump and reservoir and can be scaled up or down according to the energy and power requirements.",

        "abstract": "Lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) play a crucial role in using renewable sources. Vanadates have been applied as anode material due to the combined diffusion mechanisms and higher and stable capacities. Despite the interest in vanadates as anode materials, only a few studies have considered Ca2V2O7 (CVO) as an active material for LIBs. This work focuses on the use of CVO as a potential alternative anode‐active material for LIBs. Additionally, we investigate the effect of the conductive additive (C65) on the electrochemical properties of the electrodes, utilizing densified electrodes with a porosity of about 40 %. In doing so, this study provides important insights into new materials for LIBs, where the electrodes were manufactured using the commercial slurry methodology, replacing graphite by CVO – which was synthesized via the Pechini route (D50: 8 μm after milling). In summary, the results reveal that the amount of C65 positively affects the electrode‘s capacity. An increase in specific capacity was observed by up to 30 % using 10 wt.% C65. Such electrodes showed 235 mAh/gAM at C/10 and, when cycled at 1 C, completed 300 cycles with a retained capacity of 39 %. The results demonstrate that CVO might be a promising anode material for LIB energy storage systems.",

Because the original framework of SSSV equation is based on conventional pair correlation function, time evolution of system is expressed in terms of one-dimensional solvation structure. Here, we propose a new SSSV equation to calculate time evolution of solvation structure in three-dimensional space. The proposed theory was applied to analyze diffusion processes in 1M NaCl aqueous solution and in lithium ion battery electrolyte solution. The results demonstrate that these processes are properly described with the theory, and the computed van Hove functions are in good agreement with those in previous works.",

Here, we develop multiscale modeling to investigate the enhanced electrochemical and thermal transport properties of graphene/MoS2 heterostructures (GM-Hs) with a complex morphology. The calculated electronic structures demonstrate the greatly improved electrical conductivity of GM-Hs compared to MoS2. Increasing the graphene layers in GM-Hs not only improves the electrical conductivity but also stabilizes the intercalated Li atoms in GM-Hs. It is also found that GM-Hs with three graphene layers could achieve and maintain a high thermal conductivity of 85.5 W/(m·K) at a large temperature range (100-500 K), nearly 6 times that of pure MoS2 [∼15 W/(m·K)], which may accelerate the heat conduction from electrodes to the ambient.

        "abstract": "Temperature is a crucial state to guarantee the reliability and safety of a battery during operation. The ability to estimate battery temperature, especially the internal temperature, is of paramount importance to the battery management system for monitoring and thermal control purposes. In this paper, a data-driven approach combining the RBF neural network (NN) and the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is proposed to estimate the internal temperature for lithium-ion battery thermal management. To be specific, the suitable input terms and the number of hidden nodes for the RBF NN are first optimized by a two-stage stepwise identification algorithm (TSIA). Then, the teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm is developed to optimize the centres and widths in every neuron of basis function. After optimizing the RBF NN model, a battery lumped thermal model is adopted as the state function with the EKF to filter out the outliers of the RBF model and reduce the estimation error. This data-driven approach is validated under four different conditions in comparison with the linear NN models. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RBF data-driven approach outperforms the other approaches and can be extended to other types of batteries for thermal monitoring and management.",

        "abstract": "Amorphous carbon is regarded as a promising alternative to commercial graphite as the lithium-ion battery anode due to its capability to reversibly store more lithium ions. However, the structural disorder with a large number of defects can lead to low electrical conductivity of the amorphous carbon, thus limiting its application for high power output. Herein, ultrathin amorphous carbon nanosheets were prepared from petroleum asphalt through tuning the carbonization temperature in a molten-salt medium. The amorphous nanostructure with expanded carbon interlayer spacing can provide substantial active sites for lithium storage, while the two-dimensional (2D) morphology can facilitate fast electrical conductivity. As a result, the electrodes deliver a high reversible capacity, outstanding rate capability, and superior cycling performance (579 and 396 mAh g-1 at 2 and 5 A g-1 after 900 cycles). Furthermore, full cells consisting of the carbon anodes coupled with LiMn2O4 cathodes exhibit high specific capacity (608 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1) and impressive cycling stability with slow capacity loss (0.16% per cycle at 200 mA g-1).

Here we demonstrate concepts that allow the integration of collections of thin, millimeter-scale solid-state batteries and multijunction solar cells into electrically interconnected arrays that simultaneously provide high-performance operation and soft, biocompatible mechanics at the system level. Examples in photovoltaic energy harvesting, storage, and overall power management illustrate some of the functional options with such platforms. Thin, wearable wireless sensors for skin thermography with capabilities in data logging demonstrate the combined use of components for energy storage, power management, digital memory, physiological monitoring, and wireless, near-field communications in an integrated, stretchable device architecture with the ability to establish robust, nonirritating measurement interfaces directly to the skin. Power supply represents a critical challenge in the development of body-integrated electronic technologies. Although recent research establishes an impressive variety of options in energy storage (batteries and supercapacitors) and generation (triboelectric, piezoelectric, thermoelectric, and photovoltaic devices), the modest electrical performance and/or the absence of soft, biocompatible mechanical properties limit their practical use. The results presented here form the basis of soft, skin-compatible means for efficient photovoltaic generation and high-capacity storage of electrical power using dual-junction, compound semiconductor solar cells and chip-scale, rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, respectively. Miniaturized components, deformable interconnects, optimized array layouts, and dual-composition elastomer substrates, superstrates, and encapsulation layers represent key features. Systematic studies of the materials and mechanics identify optimized designs, including unusual configurations that exploit a folded, multilayer construct to improve the functional density without adversely affecting the soft, stretchable characteristics. System-level examples exploit such technologies in fully wireless sensors for precision skin thermography, with capabilities in continuous data logging and local processing, validated through demonstrations on volunteer subjects in various realistic scenarios.",

Moreover, the influence of ambient temperature on the maximum temperature was approximately 2.5 times greater than the C-rate, while the influence of ambient temperature on the highest temperature difference was approximately 50 times greater than the C-rate. The quantified parameter effects can be used to improve the phase change material-battery cooling system.",

        "abstract": "Owing to their high redox potential and availability of numerous diffusion channels in metal–organic frameworks, Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are attractive for metal ion storage applications. Recently, vanadium ferrocyanides (VFCN) have received a great deal of attention for application in sodium-ion batteries, as they demonstrate a stable capacity with high redox potential of ~3.3 V vs. Na/Na+. Nevertheless, there have been no reports on the application of VFCN in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). In this work, a facile synthesis of VFCN was performed using a simple solvothermal method under ambient air conditions through the redox reaction of VCl3 with K3[Fe(CN)6]. VFCN exhibited a high redox potential of ~3.7 V vs. Li/Li+ and a reversible capacity of ~50 mAh g–1. The differential capacity plots revealed changes in the electrochemical properties of VFCN after 50 cycles, in which the low spin of Fe ions was partially converted to high spin. Ex situ X-ray diffraction measurements confirmed the unchanged VFCN structure during cycling. This demonstrated the high structural stability of VFCN. The low cost of precursors, simplicity of the process, high stability, and reversibility of VFCN suggest that it can be a candidate for large-scale production of cathode materials for LIBs.",

        "abstract": "Silicon nanoparticles with median size of 51 nm are prepared by sand mill from waste silicon, and then carbon interweaved silicon nanoparticles/graphite anode materials are designed. Due to the size of silicon nanoparticles is restricted below critical fracture size of 150 nm as well as the rational decoration of carbon and graphite, fracture of silicon nanoparticles and volume deformation of active materials are highly alleviated, leading to low impedance, enhanced electrochemical reaction kinetics and good electronic connection between active materials and current collector. Furthermore, delithiation reversibility of the formed crystalline Li15Si4 alloy is enhanced. As a result, the anode with 10.5 wt.% content of Si (including SiOx) delivers a properly high initial reversible capacity of 505 mA h g-1, high cycling stability with capacity retentions of 86.3 % and 91.5 % at 0.1 and 1 A g-1 after 500 cycles, respectively. After cycling at a series of higher current densities, the reversible capacity recovers to original level completely (100 % recovery) when the current density is set back to original value, exhibiting outstanding rate performance. The results indicate that silicon-carbon anode can achieve high cycling performances with enhanced delithiation reversibility of the formed crystalline Li15Si4 alloy by restricting size of silicon nanoparticles and decoration of carbon materials, which are discussed systematically. The SiNPs are recycled from waste Si, and synthetic strategy of anode materials is very facile, cost-effective and nontoxic, which has potential for industrial production.",

        "abstract": "Inorganic electrolytes for solid state batteries with Li metallic anodes must combine properties such as high ionic conductivity, chemical stability, and resistance to failure due to propagation of Li dendrites. Abundance of experimental evidence suggests that cracking of the solid electrolytes due to pressure exerted by lithium plating into the material defects is the primary source of failure [1]. This is due to inherent brittleness of the ceramic ionic conductors, i.e. their inability to reduce stress by means other than fracture. Unlike ceramics, plastic deformation in glass can be achieved via shear and (or) by densification. Both mechanisms can be operational in glasses with reduced content of glass formers relative to the content of glass modifiers – i.e. inverted glasses. Using the example of lithium phosphorous oxynitride, Lipon, we demonstrate how these two mechanisms are capable of accommodating applied stress while avoiding creation of new surfaces by cracking. We investigate the resistance to fracture in Lipon-like glasses and the underlying connection to their composition via instrumented nano-indentation, Raman spectroscopy, and numerical simulations. We observe enhancement of isochoric shear with increase of Li content, similarly to the reports of increased plasticity in sodium aluminoborate glases with high alkali content [2]. Nano-indentation demonstrates that Lipon is extremely resistant to fracture, compared to other inorganic solid electrolytes [3].\n [1] Porz, T. Swamy, B.W. Sheldon, D. Rettenwander, T. Fromling, H.L.

        "abstract": "Layered lithium transition metal oxides (LTMO) are promising candidate cathode materials for next-generation high-energy density lithium ion battery. The challenge for using this category of cathode is the capacity and voltage fading, which is believed to be associated with the layered structure disordering, a process that is initiated from the surface or solid-electrolyte interface and facilitated by transition metal (TM) reduction and oxygen vacancy formation. However, the atomic level dynamic mechanism of such a layered structure disordering is still not fully clear. In this work, utilizing atomic resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), we map, for the first time at atomic scale, the spatial evolution of Ni, Co and Mn in a cycled LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 layered cathode. In combination with atomic level structural imaging, we discovered the direct correlation of TM ions migration behavior with lattice disordering, featuring the residing of TM ions in the tetrahedral site and a sequential migration of Ni, Co, and Mn upon the increased lattice disordering of the layered structure. This work highlights that Ni ions, though acting as the dominant redox species in many LTMO, are labile to migrate to cause lattice disordering upon battery cycling, while the Mn ions are more stable as compared with Ni and Co and can act as pillar to stabilize layered structure. Direct visualization of the behavior of TM ions during the battery cycling provides insight for designing of cathode with high structural stability and correspondingly a superior performance.",

        "abstract": "Using gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) for lithium-ion batteries usually encounters the drawback of poor mechanical integrity of the GPEs. This study demonstrates the outstanding performance of a GPE consisting of a commercial membrane (Celgard) incorporated with a poly(ethylene oxide)-co-poly(propylene oxide) copolymer (P(EO-co-PO)) swelled by a liquid electrolyte (LE) of 1 M LiPF6 in carbonate solvents. The proposed GPE stably holds LE with an amount that is three times that of the Celgard-P(EO-co-PO) composite. This GPE has a higher ionic conductivity (2.8×10(-3) and 5.1×10(-4) S cm(-1) at 30 and -20 °C, respectively) and a wider electrochemical voltage range (5.1 V) than the LE-swelled Celgard because of the strong ion-solvation power of P(EO-co-PO). The active ion-solvation role of P(EO-co-PO) also suppresses the formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase layer. When assembling the GPE in a Li/LiFePO4 battery, the P(EO-co-PO) network hinders anionic transport, producing a high Li+ transference number of 0.5 and decreased the polarization overpotential. The Li/GPE/LiFePO4 battery delivers a discharge capacity of 156-135 mAh g(-1) between 0.1 and 1 C-rates, which is approximately 5% higher than that of the Li/LE/LiFePO4 battery. The IR drop of the Li/GPE/LiFePO4 battery was 44% smaller than that of the Li/LE/LiFePO4. The Li/GPE/LiFePO4 battery is more stable, with only a 1.2% capacity decay for 150 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles. The advantages of the proposed GPE are its high stability, conductivity, Li+ transference number, and mechanical integrity, which allow for the assembly of GPE-based batteries readily scalable to industrial levels.",

Using first-principles calculations, we reveal that pentagonal BN2 (Penta-BN2) can serve as a compelling anode material for lithium-ion batteries. Penta-BN2 harbors intrinsic metallic nature before and after lithiation, showing excellent electrical conductivity. Significantly, the fully lithiated phase of Penta-BN2 is Li3BN2, corresponding to an ultra-high theoretical capacity of 2071 mAh g-1, superior to the capacity of most of the previously reported two-dimensional candidates. Meanwhile, the open-circuit voltage and diffusion barrier height of Penta-BN2 are found to be fascinatingly low. Moreover, in light of its small Young's modulus and robust lattice toward lithiation, Penta-BN2 can accommodate volume changes during the charging-discharging processes, remarkably beneficial for fabricating flexible electrodes.",

The core–shell ZnCo2O4@TiO2 core–shell NWAs composite is versatile as an anode material and exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance for LIBs. The initial capacity was 1598 mA h g−1 (Coulombic efficiency reached 84.0%), and the reversible capacity after 90 cycles was 827 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1, showing high capacity and good cycling stability (much better than ZnCo2O4 NWAs). The ZnCo2O4@TiO2 nanocomposite also showed excellent rate capability with a reversible capacity of 532 mA h g−1 even at a current rate of 4500 mA g−1.

        "title": "Implementation of Different Conversion/Alloy Active Materials as Anodes for Lithium-Based Solid-State Batteries.",
        "abstract": "To complement or outperform lithium-ion batteries with liquid electrolyte as energy storage devices, a high-energy as well as high-power anode material must be used in solid-state batteries. An overlooked class of anode materials is the one of conversion/alloy active materials (e.g., SnO2, which is already extensively studied in liquid electrolyte-based batteries). Conversion/alloy active materials offer high specific capacities and often also fast lithium-ion diffusion and reaction kinetics, which are required for high C-rates and application in high-energy and high-power devices such as battery electric vehicles. To date, there are only very few reports on conversion/alloy active materials─namely, SnO2─as anode material in sulfide-based solid-state batteries, with a relatively complex electrode design. Otherwise, conversion-alloy active materials are used as a seed layer or interlayer for a homogeneous Li deposition or to mitigate the formation and growth of the SEI, respectively. Within this work, four different conversion/alloy active materials─SnO2, Sn0.9Fe0.1O2, ZnO, and Zn0.9Fe0.1O─are synthesized and incorporated as negative active materials (\"anodes\") in composite electrodes into SSBs with Li6PS5Cl as solid electrolyte. The structure and the microstructure of the as-synthesized active materials and composite electrodes are investigated by XRD, SEM, and FIB-SEM. All active materials are evaluated based on their C-rate performance and long-term cyclability by galvanostatic cycling under a constant pressure of 40 MPa. Furthermore, light is shed on the degradation processes that take place at the interface between the active material and solid electrolyte. It is evidenced that the decomposition of Li6PS5Cl to LiCl, Li2S, and Li3P at the anode is amplified by Fe substitution. Lastly, a 2D sheet electrode is designed and cycled to tackle the interfacial degradation processes. This approach leads to an improved C-rate performance (factor of 3) as well as long-term cyclability (factor of 2.3).",

        "abstract": "Pyrrolidinium ionic liquids, especially pyrrolidinium acetate (PyrrAc), have demonstrated outstanding capacity for extracting lignin from biomass, as electrolytes for fuel cells and lithium ion batteries and as solvents for acid-catalyzed reactions. In this work we show that the unusual liquid nanostructure of PyrrAc is the key to its versatility as a solvent compared to other ionic liquids. Neutron diffraction with multiple H/D isotopic substitutions reveals that the bulk nanostructure of PyrrAc is a bicontinuous network of interpenetrating polar and apolar domains. However, the arrangement of groups in both domains is strikingly different from that found in other ionic liquids. In the apolar regions, the pyrrolidinium rings are highly intercalated and disordered, with no preferred alignment between adjacent pyrrolidinium rings, which distinguishes it from both π-π stacking seen in imidazolium or pyridinium ionic liquids, and the tail-tail bilayer-like arrangements in linear alkylammonium ionic liquids. The H-bond network within the polar domain extends only to form finite clusters, with long bent H-bonds to accommodate electrostatics. Therefore, while PyrrAc unquestionably has well-defined amphiphilic nanostructure, the disordered arrangement of groups in the polar and apolar domains enables it to accommodate a wide variety of solutes. The combination of well-defined polar/apolar nanostructure, but disordered arrangements of groups within domains, is therefore the origin of PyrrAc's capacity for lignin extraction and as an electrolyte.",

Maintaining the physical integrity of individual silicon particles and the anode structure is the top priority. We use strong hydrogen bonds between citric acid (CA) and silicon to firmly coat CA on silicon. Carbonized CA (CCA) enhances electrical conductivity of silicon. Polyacrylic acid (PAA) binder encapsulates silicon flakes by strong bonds formed by abundant COOH functional groups in PAA and on CCA.

        "abstract": "Nondestructive methods that allow researchers to gather high-resolution quantitative information on a material's physical properties from inside a working device are increasingly in demand from the scientific community. Synchrotron-based microcomputed X-ray tomography, which enables the fast, full-field interrogation of materials in functional, real-world environments, was used to observe the physical changes of next-generation lithium-ion battery anode materials and architectures. High capacity, nongraphitic anodes were chosen for study because they represent the future direction of the field and one of their recognized limitations is their large volume expansion and contraction upon cycling, which is responsible for their generally poor electrochemical performance. In this work, Cu6Sn5 coated on a three-dimensional copper foam was used to model a high power electrode while laminated silicon particles were used to model a high energy electrode. The electrodes were illuminated in situ and ex situ, respectively, at Sector 2-BM of the Advanced Photon Source. The changes in electrode porosity and surface area were measured and show large differences based on the electrode architecture. This work is one of the first reports of full-field synchrotron tomography on high-capacity battery materials under operating conditions.",

        "abstract": "Highly accurate state of charge (SOC) estimation of lithium-ion batteries is one of the key technologies of battery management systems in electric vehicles. The performance of SOC estimation directly influences the driving range and safety of these vehicles. Due to external disturbances, temperature variation and electromagnetic interference, accurate SOC estimation becomes difficult. To accurately estimate the SOC of lithium-ion batteries, this article presents a novel machine-learning method to address the risk of gradient explosion and gradient decent using the dynamic nonlinear auto-regressive models with exogenous input neural network (NARX) with long short-term memories (LSTM).The proposed hybrid NARX model embeds LSTM memory, which provides jump-ahead connections in the time-unfolded model. These jump-ahead connections provide a shorter path for the propagation of gradient information, therefore reducing long-term dependence on the recurrent neural network. Experimental results show that the estimation performance root mean square error (RMSE) of the proposed model is less than 1%, and this model has better multitime prediction performance. Finally, the hybrid NARX and LSTM model is compared with the standard back propagation neural network based on particle swarm optimization (BPNN-PSO), the least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) and LSTM existing models under urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) and dynamic stress test (DST) conditions. The proposed hybrid NARX-LSTM model yield relative to other methods and can estimate the battery SOC with high accuracy. The RMSE of proposed model is improved by approximately 60% compared with the standard LSTM",

In the present work, a new design of an electrochemical cell, whose anode is made in the form of silicene on a graphite substrate, is presented. The whole system was subjected to transmutation neutron doping. The molecular dynamics method was used to study the intercalation and deintercalation of lithium in a phosphorus-doped silicene channel. The maximum uniform filling of the channel with lithium is achieved at 3% and 6% P-doping of silicene. The high mobility of Li atoms in the channel creates the prerequisites for the fast charging of the battery. The method of statistical geometry revealed the irregular nature of the packing of lithium atoms in the channel. Stresses in the channel walls arising during its maximum filling with lithium are significantly inferior to the tensile strength even in the presence of polyvacancies in doped silicene. The proposed design of the electrochemical cell is safe to operate.",

        "abstract": "To overcome the inherent limitations of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) such as relatively low energy density and operating voltage compared to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), Oxygen redox chemistry is considered to realizing a high-performance battery system. However, oxygen redox commonly accompanied problems such as sluggish kinetics, O2 gas loss, and irreversible structural rearrangement with voltage hysteresis. Herein, we suggest a new model that deviates from the tendency of relying on oxygen redox reaction to realize high capacity. A deep investigation of Na0.6Mg0.2Mn0.8O2 (NMM) and Na0.6Mg0.2Ru0.2Mn0.6O2 (NMRM) is conducted by various analysis tools for the comparison. The highly oxidized Ru5+ lowers the Mn oxidation state in the structure without the Jahn-Teller effect. It drives the increased participation of Mn in the overall electrochemical reaction and the charge compensation by oxygen redox reaction is mostly replaced by the Mn3+/Mn4+ redox pair. A strong covalence of Ru stabilizes the structure and prevents cation migration from TM to Na slap. As a result, even though the specific weight increased, practical capacity was improved by maximizing the participation of Na+ ions, and we confirm that cyclability and rate capability also improved.",

First, the NP-NSG is formed via hydrothermal treatment using graphene oxide, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and thiourea as the co-dopant for N and S, followed by calcination of the N/S co-doped GO in the presence of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate to obtain the 3D MoO2/NP-NSG product. This novel material exhibits a series of out-bound electrochemical performances, such as superior conductivity, high specific capacity, and excellent stability. As an anode for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the MoO2/NP-NSG electrode has a high initial specific capacity (1376 mAh g−1), good cycling performance (1250 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.2 A g−1), and outstanding Coulombic efficiency (99% after 450 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1).

The performance of a lithium-ion battery is, to a large extent, determined by the microstructure (i.e., layer thickness and porosity) of its electrodes. Tailoring the microstructure to a specific application is a crucial process in battery development. However, unravelling the complex correlations between microstructure and rate performance using either experiments or simulations is time-consuming and costly. Our approach provides a swift method for predicting the rate capability of battery electrodes by using machine learning on microstructural images of electrode cross-sections. We train multiple models in order to predict the specific capacity based on the batteries’ microstructure and investigate the decisive parts of the microstructure through the use of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods. Our study shows that even comparably small neural network architectures are capable of providing state-of-the-art prediction results. In addition to this, our XAI studies demonstrate that the models are using understandable human features while ignoring present artefacts.",

        "abstract": "An important concern related to the performance of Li-ion batteries is the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase on the surface of the anode. This film is formed from the decomposition of electrolytes and can have important effects on the stability and performance. Here, we evaluate the decomposition pathway of ethylene carbonate and related organic electrolyte molecules using a series of density functional approximations and correlated wave function (WF) methods, including the coupled-cluster theory with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] and auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). We find that the transition state barrier associated with ring opening varies widely across different functionals, ranging from 3.01 to 17.15 kcal/mol, which can be compared to the value of 12.84 kcal/mol predicted by CCSD(T). This large variation underscores the importance of benchmarking against accurate WF methods. A performance comparison of all of the density functionals used in this study reveals that the M06-2X-D3 (a meta-hybrid GGA), CAM-B3LYP-D3 (a range-separated hybrid), and B2GP-PLYP-D3 (a double hybrid) perform the best, with average errors of about 1.50-1.60 kcal/mol compared to CCSD(T). We also compared the performance of the WF methods that are more scalable than CCSD(T), finding that DLPNO-CCSD(T) and phaseless AFQMC with a DFT trial wave function exhibit average errors of 1.38 and 1.74 kcal/mol, respectively.",

To achieve a narrow size distribution of Si NWs, the formation of bulk-like Si structures such as islands and chunks needs to be inhibited during nucleation and growth of Si NWs. We developed a simple approach to control the nucleation of Si NWs via interfacial energy tuning between metal catalysts and substrates by introducing a conductive diffusion barrier. Owing to the high interfacial energy between Au and TiN, agglomeration of Au nanoparticle catalysts was restrained on a TiN layer which induced the formation of small Au nanoparticle catalysts on TiN-coated substrates. The resulting Au catalysts led to the nucleation and growth of Si NWs on the TiN layer with higher number density and direct integration of the Si NWs onto current collectors without the formation of bulk-like Si structures. The lithium-ion battery anodes based on Si NWs grown on TiN-coated current collectors showed improved specific gravimetric capacities (>30%) for various charging rates and enhanced capacity retention up to 500 cycles of charging–discharging.",

However, its poor electronic conductivity hinders its practical application particularly at a high rate. This work reports that Li3VO4 coated with carbon was synthesized by a one-pot, two-step method with F127 ((PEO)100-(PPO)65-(PEO)100) as both template and carbon source, yielding a microcuboid structure. The resulting Li3VO4/C cuboid shows a stable capacity of 415 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C and excellent capacity stability at high rates (e.g., 92% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 10 C = 4 A g(-1)). The lithiation/delithiation process of Li3VO4/C was studied by ex situ X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, which confirmed that Li3VO4/C underwent a reversible intercalation reaction during discharge/charge processes. The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed largely to the unique microhollow structure. The voids inside hollow structure can not only provide more space to accommodate volume change during discharge/charge processes but also allow the lithium ions insertion and extraction from both outside and inside the hollow structure with a much larger surface area or more reaction sites and shorten the lithium ions diffusion distance, which leads to smaller overpotential and faster reaction kinetics. Carbon derived from F127 through pyrolysis coats Li3VO4 conformably and thus offers good electrical conduction. The results in this work provide convincing evidence that the significant potential of hollow-cuboid Li3VO4/C for high-power batteries.",

The use of PEO-based polymer composite electrolytes (PCEs) as an alternative strategy suffers from limited lithium-ion conductivity with deficient long-range transfer route. Herein, Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) nanoparticles modified with an in situ-synthesized zwitterionic covalent organic framework layer (denoted as LLZTO@HUT4) were introduced into PEO-based PCEs. Zwitterionic HUT4 modified the lithiophobic LiOH/Li2CO3 layer on the surface of LLZTO nanoparticles, which could notably promote Li+ ion transport for superior electrochemical performance of PCEs. Additionally, the intermediate layer HUT4 located between LLZTO and PEO could further improve the mechanical properties of electrolytes due to the enhanced inorganic/organic interface compatibility and intermolecular interaction. As a result, the obtained LLZTO@HUT4-15%/PEO electrolyte exhibited a competent ionic conductivity of 0.73 mS cm-1 with a Li+ transference number of up to 0.74 at 60 °C. The assembled S@CNT|LLZTO@HUT4-15%/PEO|Li coin cell delivered a considerable initial discharge capacity of 1018 mA h g-1 at 0.2 C, with approximately 92.1% capacity retention after 100 cycles, elucidating an obviously suppressed shuttle effect.",

        "abstract": "Existing in operando methods for detection of plated lithium can only detect the presence of plating after the charge is complete and irreversible damage has already occurred. In this work, the characteristic potential minimum on the graphite electrode during high rate lithiation is proposed and assessed as an in operando technique for detecting the onset of lithium plating. While other studies have shown that rapid self-heating of a cell can cause this type of \"voltage overshoot,\" we confirm through temperature-controlled coin cell experiments that such a voltage profile can also be caused by the occurrence of severe lithium plating. In cells which demonstrated voltage overshoot, macroscopically observable lithium plating films were present on the graphite electrodes upon disassembly, resulting in very poor single-cycle Coulombic efficiency. The significance of this voltage characteristic is confirmed through direct observation of the onset of lithium plating in an in-situ optical microscopy cell. We observe that the growth of large metallic lithium deposits within the porous electrode structure can cause swelling and cracking of the graphite electrode, suggesting loss of active material due to mechanical electrode degradation as an important consequence of severe lithium plating.",

        "abstract": "Cycling aging is the one of the main reasons affecting the lifetime of lithium-ion batteries and the contribution of aluminum current collector corrosion to the ageing is not fully recognized. In general, aluminum is corrosion resistant to electrolyte since a non-permeable surface film of alumina is naturally formed. However, corrosion of aluminum current collector can still occur under certain conditions such as lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI)-based electrolyte or high voltage. Herein, we investigates the corrosion of aluminum current collector in the electrolyte of 1.2M LiFSI in ethylene carbonate (EC) and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) mixed solvents. The electrochemical results shows that the corrosion current of aluminum is enhanced by cycling time and potential, which is correlated with the surface species and morphology. The formation of AlF3, which is induced by deep penetration of F- anions through surface passivation film, leads to internal volume change and the surface crack in the end. Our work will be inspiring for future development of high-energy-density and high-power-density lithium-ion batteries in which the LiFSI salt will be intensively used.",

        "abstract": "There are only a handful of reports on indium sulfide (In2S3) in the electrochemical energy storage field without a clear electrochemical reaction mechanism. In this work, a simple electrospinning method has been used to synthesize In2S3/C nanofibers for the first time. In lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the In2S3/C nanofiber electrode can not only deliver a high initial reversible specific capacity of 696.4 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1, but also shows ultra-long cycle life with a capacity retention of 80.5% after 600 cycles at 1000 mA g-1. In sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), the In2S3/C nanofibers electrode can exhibit a high initial reversible specific capacity (393.7 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1) and excellent cycling performance with a high capacity retention of 97.3% after 300 cycles at 1000 mA g-1. The excellent electrochemical properties mainly benefited from In2S3 being encapsulated by a carbon matrix, which buffers the volume expansion and significantly improves the conductivity of the composite. Furthermore, the structural evolution of In2S3 during the first lithiation/delithiation and sodiation/desodiation processes has been illustrated by ex situ XRD. The results confirm that the reaction mechanism of In2S3 in both LIBs and SIBs can be summarized as conversion reactions and alloying reactions, which provide theoretical support for the development of In2S3 in the field of electrochemistry.",

        "abstract": "In scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), the addition of a redox active species plays an essential role. Those deliberately added mediators may alter results in SECM studies. In investigations of lithium‐ion battery (LIB) materials, especially of the positive electrode, the oxidation potentials of commonly used mediator substances such as ferrocene are located within the operation potential of the electrode. Thus, they possibly interfere with the regular charge/discharge processes. In situ studies are therefore in need of approaches reducing or eliminating the use of mediators. Within this publication, a novel mediator dosing (MD) concept is introduced. A capillary was closely positioned at the tip of the scanning probe. By gravity flow, stable flow rates of mediator solution of up to 32.4±0.6 μL h−1 were achieved. These low amounts were found to be sufficient to form a ferrocene zone at the probe tip enabling feedback mode SECM measurements with comparable quality to measurements directly in ferrocene solution. Proof of concept experiments were conducted by investigation of a thin‐film electrode with a micro‐structured surface. Furthermore, the MD concept was applied in imaging experiments of a commercially available LIB graphite electrode.",

RGO/SnO2 composite was first coated by a nanothick polydopamine (PD) layer and the PD-coated RGO/SnO2 composite was then cross-linked with poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) that was used as a binder to accomplish a whole anode electrode. The cross-link reaction between PAA and PD produced a robust network in the anode system to stabilize the whole anode during cycling. As a result, the designed anode exhibits an outstanding energy capacity up to 718 mAh/g at current density of 100 mA/g after 200 cycles and a good rate performance of 811, 700, 641, and 512 mAh/g at current density of 100, 250, 500, and 1000 mA/g, respectively. Fourier transform IR spectra confirm the formation of cross-link reaction and the stability of the robust network after long-term cycling.

However, the sodium polysulfide shuttle effect and dendritic growth pose significant challenges to their practical applications. In this study, we apply diverse disciplinary backgrounds to introduce a novel method to stimulate polarized BaTiO3 (BTO) nanoparticles on the separator. This approach generates more charges due to the piezoelectric effect under stronger driving forces produced by applying a controllable acoustic field at the outer edge of the cell. The acoustically stimulated BTO attracts more polysulfides, thus reducing the shuttling effect from the cathode to the anode and ultimately enhancing the battery performance. Meanwhile, the acoustic waves create additional streaming flows, improving the uniformity of the sodium ion dispersion, enhancing the sodium ion transport and reducing the possibility of sodium dendrite development. We believe that this work offers a new strategy for the development of high-performance Na–S batteries.",

However, in reality, GeP usually suffers from relatively slow Li + diﬀusion and poor cycling stability associated with its stiﬀ bulky structure as synthesized using conventional mixing-sintering method, in which the predicted quickest electron-ion transport pathways tend to be concealed. Herein, for the first time, we propose an in-situ template method to directionally induce the construction of GeP nanobar (GeP-nb) coral s with an adjustable aspect ratio . The GeP nanobars grown onto conductive matrix with high aspect ratio expose more quickest electron-ion transportation facets for fast reaction dynamics, which not only is the first verification of the theoretical prediction, but also reveals the underlying mechanism of crystal orientation optimization on the electrochemical behavior of GeP-based materials. Besides, the customized GeP-nb electrode delivers a self-healable homeostatic behavior by reversibly stabilizing GeP crystalline structure through multi-phase reactions to maintain structural integrity and cycling stability (850 mAh g -1 at 1 A g -1 after 500 cycles). As a result, the GeP-nb presents the highest Li + diffusion coefficient (6.21×10 -11 cm 2 s -1 ) among all the Ge-based anode materials studied so far, rendering an excellent rate performance (620 mAh g -1 at 5 A g -1 ) as a LIBs anode.

The formation mechanism of ultrathin nanosheets was studied in detail. The eutectic molten salts possess low melting points and become a strong polar solvent at the calcined temperature, making the acidified coal miscible with them in very homogeneously state.

The State of Charge (SOC) is circumscribed as the remaining charge of the lithium battery (Li-ion), that indicates the driving range of a pure electric vehicle. Additionally, it is the basis for SOH and fault state prediction. Nevertheless, the SOC is incapable of measuring directly. In this paper, an LSTM-Attention-R network framework is proposed. The LSTM algorithm is accustomed to present the timing information and past state information of the lithium battery data. The Attention algorithm is used to extract the global information of features and solve the problem of long-term dependency. To ensure the diversity of feature extraction, the Attention algorithm in this paper uses multi-headed self-attentiveness. The CACLE dataset from the University of Maryland is used in this paper. Through the training of the model and the comparison, it is concluded that the LSTM-Attention-R algorithm networks proposed in this article can predict the value of SOC well. Meanwhile, this paper compares the LSTM-Attention-R algorithm with the LSTM algorithm, and also compares the LSTM-Attention-R algorithm with the Attention algorithm. Finally, it is concluded that the accomplishment of the network framework contrived is superior to the performance of these two algorithms alone. Finally, the algorithm has good engineering practice implications. The algorithm proposed provides a better research direction for future parameter prediction in the field of lithium batteries. It has a better theoretical significance.",

Reported herein is a simple synthetic methodology, based on the conversion of self-assembled superlattices of Fe3 O4 nanocrystals, to fabricate highly ordered mesoporous graphene frameworks (MGFs) with ultrathin pore walls consisting of three to six stacking graphene layers. The MGFs possess face-centered-cubic symmetry with interconnected mesoporosity, tunable pore width, and high surface area. Because of their unique architectures and superior structural durability, the MGFs exhibit excellent cycling stability and rate performance when used as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, thus retaining a specific capacity of 520 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 300 mA g(-1) after 400 cycles.",

        "abstract": "As promising cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), Fe-containing Li-rich compounds of Li1+xFe0.1Ni0.15Mn0.55Oy (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.3 and 1.9 ≤ y ≤ 2.05) have been successfully synthesized by calcining the spherical precursors with appropriate amounts of lithium carbonate. The structures, morphologies, and chemical states of these compounds are characterized to better understand the corresponding electrochemical performances. With an increase of lithium content, Li1+xFe0.1Ni0.15Mn0.55Oy evolves from a complex layered-spinel structure to a layered structure. The lithium content also affects the average size and adhesion of the primary particles. At 0.1 C, sample x = 0.1 shows the highest first charge/discharge specific capacities (338.7 and 254.3 mA h g–1), the highest first Coulombic efficiency (75.1%), the lowest first irreversible capacity loss (84.4 mA h g–1), the highest reversible discharge specific capacity, and good rate capability. Notably, voltage fading can be alleviated through the adjustment of structural features. Such superior electrochemical performances of sample x = 0.1 are ascribed to the hierarchical micro-/nanostructure, the harmonious existence of complex layered-spinel phase, and the low charge-transfer resistance. An integral view of structure evolution from layered to spinel during synthetic control and cycling process is provided to broaden the performance scope of Li–Fe–Ni–Mn–O cathodes for LIBs.",

        "abstract": "Lithium ion batteries have conquered most of the portable electronics market and are now on the verge of deployment in large scale applications. To be competitive in the automotive and stationary sectors, however, they must be improved in the fields of safety and energy density (W h L(-1)). Solid-state batteries with a ceramic electrolyte offer the necessary advantages to significantly improve the current state-of-the-art technology. The major limit towards realizing a practical solid-state lithium-ion battery lies in the lack of viable ceramic ionic conductors. Only a few candidate materials are available, each carrying a difficult balance between advantages and drawbacks. Here we introduce a new class of possible solid-state lithium-ion conductors with the spinel structure. Such compounds could be coupled with spinel-type electrode materials to obtain a \"lattice matching\" solid device where low interfacial resistance could be achieved. Powders were prepared by wet chemistry, their structure was studied by means of diffraction techniques and magic angle spinning NMR, and Li(+) self-diffusion was estimated by static NMR line shape measurements. Profound differences in the Li(+) diffusion properties were observed depending on the composition, lithium content and cationic distribution. Local Li(+) hopping in the spinel materials is accompanied by a low activation energy of circa 0.35 eV being comparable with that of, e.g., LLZO-type garnets, which represent the current benchmark in this field. We propose these novel materials as a building block for a lattice-matching all-spinel solid-state battery with low interfacial resistance.",

Based on first-principles calculations, we study the interaction between Li and silicene and explore the microscopic mechanism of Li storage on silicene. We find that Li ion is adsorbed on hollow sites at a very low concentration of less than 1.56%. At a high concentration of Li, the Li chains with up-down pairs on top sites become popular. With the formation of the Li chains, the local structure of silicene is modulated. In addition, the electronic states near the Fermi level are found to be renormalized. There is no obvious charge transfer from Li to Si, distinct from the C based materials, although the local charge distributions are polarized under the trapping of Li, implying a greater chemical interaction than that of the weak interaction with graphene. It is predicted that the capacity of silicene can reach 1196 mA h g-1 due to Li intercalation without the breaking of the Si-Si bonds.",

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that there exists a conjugation effect between oxygen atoms of methoxy groups and AQ skeleton, which could extend the conjugate plane and increase intermolecular interaction. As a result, DMAQ shows considerably reduced solubility in ether solvent/electrolyte and greatly enhanced cycling performance compared with those of AQ. Interestingly, it is found that the electrolyte concentration plays an important role in determining the electrochemical performance. Cycling under a relatively low (2 M) or high (6 M) concentration electrolyte of (lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide in mixture solvent of 1,3-dioxolane and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (1/1, v/v) displays unsatisfied cell performance.

        "abstract": "Aluminum foil is the most frequently used as a cathodic current collector for batteries because of its high electrical conductivity, low cost, robust electrochemical properties, and low density. However, as next-generation batteries are created, serious corrosion poses new challenges to aluminum current collectors, especially with no effective additive in an aqueous electrolyte. A newly 5-formyl-8-hydroxyquinoline (FHQ) additive is designed and synthesized as an effective corrosion inhibitor for aluminum foil. The effect of FHQ on the corrosion of the Al current collector in an aqueous-based electrolyte has been investigated using electrochemical methods and spectroscopy techniques for assessing the corrosion inhibition efficacy and protective film formation on the Al surface. The Potentiodynamic polarization measurements indicated that the corrosion rate in millimeters per year (mmpy) of 1.37×10-3 is much lower in the aqueous electrolyte of 21 m LiTFSI with the FHQ additive than 2.29×10-2 in the electrolyte without an additive. Meanwhile, the Zn//LVPF configuration is developed as an efficient protocol to evaluate the corrosion prevention efficiency of inhibitors in an aqueous-based battery for the first time. The Zn//LVPF cell in the aqueous electrolyte with the FHQ additive provides much higher capacity retention and average Coulombic efficiency than the cell in the electrolyte in the absence of an additive. Interestingly, the Al corrosion prevention efficiency of the developed additive is also observed in an organic electrolyte-based battery. This work paves a new pathway to develop effective Al corrosion inhibitors for applications in lithium-ion batteries, especially in aqueous electrolytes.\n \n Keywords; Corrosion inhibitor; 8-hydroxyquinoline; 5-formyl-8-hydroxyquinoline; Doner/acceptor; HOMO-LUMO; Aluminum corrosion.",

        "abstract": "Nanoparticle LiFePO4, the basis for an entire class of high power Li-ion batteries, has recently been shown to exist in binary lithiated/delithiated states at intermediate states of charge. The Mn-bearing version, LiMn(y)Fe(1-y)PO4, exhibits even higher rate capability as a lithium battery cathode than LiFePO4 of comparable particle size. To gain insight into the cause(s) of this desirable performance, the electrochemically driven phase transformation during battery charge and discharge of nanoscale LiMn0.4Fe0.6PO4 of three different average particle sizes, 52, 106, and 152 nm, is investigated by operando synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction. In stark contrast to the binary lithiation states of pure LiFePO4 revealed in recent investigations, the formations of metastable solid solutions covering a remarkable wide compositional range, including while in two-phase coexistence, are observed. Detailed analysis correlates this behavior with small elastic misfits between phases compared to either pure LiFePO4 or LiMnPO4. On the basis of time- and state-of-charge dependence of the olivine structure parameters, we propose a coherent transformation mechanism. These findings illustrate a second, completely different phase transformation mode for pure well-ordered nanoscale olivines compared to the well-studied case of LiFePO4.",

        "abstract": "The current wet process of LIB electrode fabrication presents several challenges, including the use of the environmentally toxic and harmful N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent and non-uniform binder distribution due to the capillary force of the drying process. In addition, it is difficult to increase the thickness of the electrode and leads to relatively low-capacity electrodes. To address these issues, solvent-free dry electrode processes are promising. In the dry electrode process, binders play crucial roles in free-standing electrode formation. Fibrillization of Polytetrafluoroethylene(PTFE) occurs at a temperature of about 19 ℃, and the shear force of high temperature and high pressure helps to maintain the shape of the free-standing electrode.\n In this study, we performed a comparative analysis through the physical blending of PTFE and PVDF polymer binders with different ratios. A variety of characterization tools are used to investigate the optimal ratio that ensures good cycle performance for high-loading cathode electrodes while maintaining free-standing electrodes: 180° peel test, sheet-resistance test, SAICAS, FE-SEM, and electrochemical performance tests\n \n Keywords: Solvent-free, Dry electrode; electrode fabrication; PTFE polymer binder, Fibrillization, Lithium ion batteries\n \n \n \n \n Figure 1\n",

Ultra-thin NiO nanosheets are revealed to grow uniformly on the porous ZnCo2O4 nanowires with many interparticle mesopores, resulting in the formation of 3D core/shell nanowire arrays with hierarchical architecture.

The superior Li storage performance of the ZCO/NiO NWs could be attributed to the synergetic effect between the ZnCo2O4 core and the NiO shell, as well as its unique hierarchical architecture, which ensures a large specific surface area and good conductivity.

However, the practical applications of Li‐S batteries are challenged by several obstacles, including the low sulfur utilization and poor lifespan, which are partly attributed to the shuttle of lithium polysulfides and lithium dendrite growth during cycling.[1] The shuttling of polysulfide ions between the electrodes in a Li‐S battery is a major technical issue triggering the self‐discharge and limiting the cycle life.[2] A stable lithium anode is essential for maintaining the good cycle stability of Li‐S batteries in practical applications.[3] To address these lithium related issues, various carbon materials, including graphite and graphene, have been investigated as suitable lithium hosts to use as anode materials for Li‐S batteries.[4] In this study, prelithiated graphite and graphene‐based anode materials are obtained by galvanostatic charging method to improve the performance of Li‐S batteries and compare the electrochemical properties especially in terms of capacity retention and rate capability. According to the results, graphene showed better performance due to its high lithium storage capacity and fast lithium‐ion diffusion rate.

Our combined pair distribution function and density functional theory analysis indicates that oxygen vacancy formation is accompanied by spontaneous rearrangement of fluorine anions and vacancies, producing dual pyramidal (FeF4)-O-(FeF4) structural units containing 5-fold-coordinated Fe atoms. The addition of lattice oxygen introduces new electronic states above the top of the valence band, with a corresponding reduction in the optical band gap from 4.05 to 2.05 eV. This band gap reduction relative to the FeF3 parent material is correlated with a significant improvement in lithium insertion capability relative to a defect-free compound.",

The explosions were initiated by activating thermal runaway in three commercial batteries: (1) lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC), (2) lithium iron phosphate (LFP), and (3) lithium titanate oxide (LTO). Post-explosion aerosols were collected on anodisc filters and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The SEM and EDS analyses showed that aerosol morphologies and compositions were comparable to individual grains within the original battery materials for the NMC cell, which points to the fracture and ejection of the original battery components during the explosion. In contrast, the LFP cell emitted carbonaceous cenospheres, which suggests aerosol formation by the decomposition of organics within molten microspheres. LTO explosion aerosols showed characteristics of both types of emissions. The abundance of elements from the anode, cathode, and separator in respirable aerosols underscored the need for the selection of low-toxicity battery materials due to potential exposures in the event of battery thermal runaway.",

        "abstract": "Among the different factors that influence lithium-ion batteries (LIB) performances, the properties of the cathode active material (CAM) play a crucial role. The composition, the crystallinity and also the particle size and morphology of these materials are part of the major parameters governing the CAM behaviour. These parameters are strongly dependent of the synthesis method, especially in the case of the hydroxide precursor of the layered LiNixMnyCozO2\n [1].\n One of the most widely spread synthesis method of such precursors is the synthesis by co-precipitation, where metal salts of Ni, Mn and Co are precipitated together in a continually-stirred tank reactor (CSTR) in carefully controlled pH- and temperature conditions[2]. Any parameter of the co-precipitation must be precisely tuned to obtain the desired material, as highlighted in the figure here after.\n Considering the increasing presence of wanted (coating/doping)[3] and unwanted (impurities after recycling)[4] elements in the co-precipitation process, extensive knowledge of their impact on it is of great interest. Therefore, the synthesis of NixMnyCoz(OH)2 was conducted by co-precipitation with the controlled addition of increasing amounts of elements such as Cu and Al.\n The effects of these additions were investigated by thoroughly characterizing the morphology of the obtained hydroxides with the help of SEM, BET, particle size distribution and porosity measurements. The composition of the synthesized hydroxides was determined by the ICP-OES technique. The possible influence on the further step of CAM synthesis, i.e. calcination, was followed by in-situ X-Ray thermodiffraction and the electrochemical performances were assessed by galvanostatic cycling the obtained CAM in lithium half-cells. This helped to evidence the varying impact of the added elements, depending on their concentration in the synthesis process.\n This work is supported by the German Ministry for Economy and Climate Protection (BMWK).\n \n References\n \n [1] Malik, M., et al., Materials Today Energy, 2022, 28, 101066\n [2] Van Bommel, A., Dahn, J.R., Chemistry of Materials, 2009, 21, 1500-1503\n [3] Feng, Z. et al., ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, 2021, 13, 43039-43050\n [4] Kim, S. et al., Journal of Alloys and Compounds, 2021, 857, 157581\n \n \n \n \n \n Figure 1\n",

This paper discusses strategies based on structured, semantic, and linked data to manage this information overload. Structured data follows a predefined, machine-readable format; semantic data includes metadata for context; linked data references other semantic data, forming a web of interconnected information. We use a battery-related ontology, BattINFO to standardise terms and enable automated data extraction and analysis. Our methodology integrates full-text search and machine-readable data, enhancing data retrieval and battery testing. We aim to unify commercial cell information and develop tools for the battery community such as manufacturer-independent cycling procedure descriptions and external memory for Large Language Models. Although only a first step, this approach significantly accelerates battery research and digitalizes battery testing, inviting community participation for continuous improvement.

        "abstract": "Although pristine metal-organic framework (MOF) anodes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) show moderate activities and relatively stable cycling, the poor rate capability of the MOF anodes limited their applications in the development of a new generation of energy storage. Herein, the electric active CoII ion is selected to coordinate with redox-active S-rich tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives to create two TTF-Co-MOFs, formulated as [Co2(py-TTF-py)2(BDC)2]·2DMF·H2O (TTF-Co-MOF 1) and [Co2(py-TTF-py)2(BPDC)2]·3DMF·3H2O (TTF-Co-MOF 2), where py-TTF-py = 2,6-bis(4'-pyridyl)tetrathiafulvalene, H2BDC = terephthalic acid, H2BPDC = biphenyl-4,4'-dicarboxylic acid, and DMF = N,N-dimethylformamide. Crystallographic characterization indicated that the two MOFs possess similar 2-fold-interpenetrating 3D frameworks but with two different pore sizes. The pore-size-dependent performances of the TTF-Co-MOFs were explored to optimize the MOFs as the anode materials for LIBs. TTF-Co-MOF 1 presents a high reversible specific capacity of 1186.6 mAh g-1 at 200 mA g-1 after 287 cycles. The rate capability is greatly enhanced by the introduction of CoII into TTF-based MOFs with specific capacities of 1028.6 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 and 966.5 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1. On the basis of the series analysis of theoretical calculations, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and crystal structures, it is found that the CoII metal centers play a bridging role in charge transport within the MOF framework, which is beneficial for the transportation of Li ions. The competitive performances of TTF-Co-MOF 1 are attributed to the synergistic effect of the CoII metal centers and S-rich TTF ligand as well as suitable porosity. The study shed some light for the fabrication of advanced energy storage devices through the rational design of MOF-based anode materials.",

To study the behavior of ion transport and reaction in these applications, we report the use of a focused ion beam of Li+ to locally insert controlled quantities of lithium with high spatial-resolution into electrochemically relevant materials in vacuo. To benchmark the technique, we present results on direct-write lithiation of 35 nm thick crystalline silicon membranes using a 2 keV beam of Li+ at doses up to 1018 cm-2 (104 nm-2). We confirm quantitative sub-μm control of lithium insertion and characterize the concomitant morphological, structural and functional changes of the system using a combination of electron and scanning probe microscopy. We observe saturation of interstitial lithium in the silicon membrane at ≈ 10 % dopant number density and spillover of excess lithium onto the membrane's surface. The implanted Li+ is demonstrated to remain electrochemically active. This technique will enable controlled studies and improve understanding of Li+ ion interaction with local defect structures and interfaces in electrode and solid-electrolyte materials.",

        "abstract": "Promoting interfacial kinetics of high‐nickel LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) is a critical strategy for enhancing rate capability of lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs). At the solid‐liquid interface of positive electrode, charge transfer across the cathode‐electrolyte interphase (CEI) is responsible for the interfacial redox reaction, which is dominated by desolvation process of Li+ and NMC811 CEI evolution. Since these two processes are significantly impacted by the solvation effect of electrolytes, herein single‐particle Raman spectroscopy and single‐particle probes are established to quantitatively study the influences of solvation effect on CEI evolution and desolvation process of Li+, respectively. Owing to oxidation of the unstable free cyclic carbonate ester from dissociation of solvation structure, the CEI is found to grow thicker during discharge process. Due to the decreased concentration of cyclic carbonate in the solvation structure, the desolvation process of Li+ in the ethyl methyl carbonate‐ethylene carbonate electrolyte can be reduced by 11.8% compared to that in the dimethyl carbonate‐ethylene carbonate electrolyte. With the presence of ethyl methyl carbonate‐ethylene carbonate electrolyte, thinner CEI and easier desolvation process of Li+ can be simultaneously achieved on the NMC811 surface. Accordingly, its corresponding LIBs deliver the highest specific capacity ≈138.8 mAh g−1 at 5C among the LIBs with the other commonly used electrolytes.",

        "abstract": "The poor cyclability and rate property of commercial TiO2 (c-TiO2) hinder its utilization in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Coating carbon is one of the ways to ameliorate the electrochemical performance. However, how to effectively form a uniform thin carbon coating is still a challenge. On the basis of the strong interaction of the TiO2 surface with carboxyl groups, herein a new tactic to achieve uniform and thin carbon layers on the c-TiO2 particles was proposed. When mixing c-TiO2 with citric acid containing carboxyl groups in deionized water, the high-affinity adsorption of TiO2 for carboxyl groups resulted in self-assembled carboxylate monolayers on the surface of TiO2 which evolved into a uniform few-layered amorphous carbon coating during carbonizing at 750 °C. The product derived from the mixture of c-TiO2 and citric acid with a mass ratio of 1 : 0.3 exhibits the optimal performance, revealing a high specific capacity (256.6 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 0.1 A g−1) and outstanding cycling stability (retaining a capacity of 160.0 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 0.5 A g−1). The greatly enhanced capacity and cyclability correlate with the uniform few-layered carbon coating which not only ameliorates the electronic conductivity of c-TiO2 but also avoids the reduction in ionic conductivity caused by thick carbon layers and redundant carbon.",

        "abstract": "Lithium–sulfur (Li-S) batteries are the most attractive candidates for next-generation large-scale energy storage because of their high theoretical energy density and the affordability of sulfur. However, most of the reported research primarily concentrates on low sulfur loading (below 2 mgs cm−2) cathodes using binders and traditional collectors, thus undermining the expected energy density. Herein, a N, O co-doped carbon nanotube (N, O-CNT) decorated wood framework (WF), denoted as WF-CNT, was designed as a free-standing sulfur host, achieving high sulfur loading of 10 mgs cm−2. This unique cathode featured low tortuosity microchannels and a conductive framework, reducing the diffusion paths for both ions and electrons and accommodating the volume changes associated with sulfur. Moreover, the internal CNT forests effectively captured soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and catalyze their redox kinetic. Consequently, the S@WF-CNT-800 sample exhibited a high initial discharge capacity of 1438.2 mAh g−1 at a high current density of 0.5 A g−1. Furthermore, a reversible capacity of 404.5 mAh g−1 was obtained after 500 cycles with sulfur loading of 5 mgs cm−2 at 0.5 A g−1. This work may support the development of high sulfur loading cathodes utilizing cost-effective and sustainable biomass materials for Li-S batteries.",

        "abstract": "Various CuO nanostructures have been well studied as anode materials for lithium ion batteries (LIBs); however, there are few reports on the synthesis of porous CuO nanostructures used for anode materials, especially one-dimensional (1D) porous CuO. In this work, novel 1D highly porous CuO nanorods with tunable porous size were synthesized in large-quantities by a new, friendly, but very simple approach. We found that the pore size could be controlled by adjusting the sintering temperature in the calcination process. With the rising of calcination temperature, the pore size of CuO has been tuned in the range of ∼0.4 nm to 22 nm. The porous CuO materials have been applied as anode materials in LIBs and the effects of porous size on the electrochemical properties were observed. The highly porous CuO nanorods with porous size in the range of ∼6 nm to 22 nm yielded excellent high specific capacity, good cycling stability, and high rate performance, superior to that of most reported CuO nanocomposites. The CuO material delivers a high reversible capacity of 654 mA h g(-1) and 93% capacity retention over 200 cycles at a rate of 0.5 C. It also exhibits excellent high rate capacity of 410 mA h g(-1) even at 6 C. These results suggest that the facile synthetic method of producing a tunable highly porous CuO nanostructure can realize a long cycle life with high reversible capacity, which is suitable for next-generation high-performance LIBs.",

        "abstract": "Lithium-ion batteries are the most widely used as energy storage devices in electric mobility applications. However, due to complex electrochemical processes of battery degradation, it is challenging to predict accurately the battery end-of-life (EOL) to ensure their reliability, safety, and extended usage. In this context, the introduction of machine learning techniques can provide relevant solutions based on data collection and analysis. Indeed, we compared in this study the prediction performance of numerous machine learning approaches that predict if the battery EOL bypasses a predefined threshold. Based on the variation of different indicators during the first several hundred cycles, such as charge and discharge capacity, internal resistance, and energy efficiency, extensive numerical tests have been executed and compared in terms of accuracy score, precision score, recall score, etc. All the studied machine learning approaches are trained and validated using an open-access database of 124 commercial lithium iron phosphate/graphite cells cycled under different fast-charging conditions. As a result, the classification prediction performance score reached up to 98.74% depending on the percentage of data and cycles used for training and validation as well as the predefined EOL threshold. The comparative results can be used to improve the existing health-aware energy management strategy by taking the state-of-health (SOH) of batteries into consideration. Overall, the presented research findings are relevant to battery system reliability and safety engineering.",

        "title": "Direct Contact Prelithiation of Multi-Layered Lithium-Ion Battery Pouch Cells Using a Scalable Prelithiation Process",
        "abstract": "\n Prelithiation is known to enhance the performance of lithium-ion batteries and is becoming increasingly popular. To date, different approaches and concepts for prelithiation processes have only been implemented on a laboratory scale, which is due to the complex upscaling of the process approaches. Moreover, investigations of prelithiation approaches are mostly limited to small-format laboratory cells, and concepts for implementation on an industrial scale are scarce. The present study introduces a scalable, roll-to-roll capable process for direct contact prelithiation of anodes for large-format and multi-layered pouch cells. The process is based on calendering for applying lithium foils to anodes. The feasibility of scaling the approach from single-layer to multi-layer pouch cells was further investigated. The prelithiated cells with silicon-graphite composite anodes showed an improved first-cycle coulombic efficiency of up to 8% and increased coulombic efficiencies during cyclization compared to non-prelithiated cells. By improving capacity retention, cycle life could be increased by up to 170% compared to non-prelithiated cells. Post-mortem analyses conducted after 4000 cycles show that the direct contact prelithiation method used does not cause profound lithium plating. Summarizing, the employed direct contact prelithiation process is suitable for a scalable, industry-capable prelithiation of lithium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Power sources supported by lithium-ion battery (LIB) technology has been considered to be the most suitable for public and military use. Battery quality is always a critical issue since electric engines and portable devices use power-consuming algorithms for security. For the practical use of LIBs in public applications, low heat generation, and fast charging are essential requirements, but those features are still unsatisfactory so far. In particular, the slow Li+ intercalation kinetics, lithium plating, and self-heat generation of conventional graphite-anode LIBs under fast-charging conditions are impediments to the use of these batteries by the public demands. The use of silicon-based anodes, which are associated with fast reaction kinetics and rapid Li+ diffusion, has great potential to render LIBs suitable for public use in the near future. In this perspective, the challenges in and future directions for developing silicon-based anode materials for realizing LIBs with fast-charging capability are highlighted.",

        "abstract": "Cationic doping has been regarded as an effective strategy to improve the electrochemical performance of transition metal composites for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, we report manganese doped cobalt nitrides (Mn0.33Co0.67N) as a novel anode material for LIBs with a high reversible capacity close to 900 mA h g-1 after 150 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g-1, which is superior to 749 mA h g-1 of undoped CoN. The most fascinating performance of Mn0.33Co0.67N is the rate capability, in which 91% of capacity is maintained when the current density increases ten-fold from 0.2 A g-1 to 2.0 A g-1. This enhanced electrochemical performance is attributed to the fact that Mn doping makes it faster to regenerate Co-N bonds, as evidenced by a calculated apparent ammoniation activation energy (Ea) decrease from 113 kJ mol-1 to 96 kJ mol-1. This fast regeneration of Co-N bonds upon conversion reactions is believed to prevent the nitride electrode from a partial loss of charge capacity upon high rate cycling, in turn facilitating the extrinsic pseudocapacitive contribution.",

        "abstract": "Layered oxides LiNixCoyMnzO2 are widely used as the main cathode material for high-energy lithium-ion batteries. Over long-term cycling, irreversible phase transformations in layered oxides usually occur along with the loss of active lithium, which directly reflects in the sharp decrease of capacity. However, it is difficult to accurately and rapidly determine lithium content in aged materials, raising extreme impediments in the direct recycling of layered oxides. Herein, we propose a facile method for quick and accurate calculation of the residual lithium content through the developed relationship of shear strain and the states of charge. Based on this recognization, a discharge capacity close to the original capacity of the pristine material is achieved in the regenerated material by combining a hydrothermal method with annealing treatment. The recycled material demonstrates a dramatic improvement in electrochemical properties, especially the high rate performance. This method not only effectively realizes the quantitative regeneration of cathode materials but also provides a possible strategy for the future development of direct regeneration.",

Further, the printed LIMBs show notable capacity retention of 88% after 3000 cycles, and outstanding flexibility without any structure degradation under various torsion states and folding angles. Importantly, a wearable smart bracelet, composed of a serially connected LIMBs pack, a temperature sensor, and a light-emitting diode, is realized for the automatic detection of body temperature.

        "abstract": "A novel microstructure of anode materials for lithium-ion batteries with ternary components, comprising tin (Sn), rice husk-derived silica (SiO2), and bronze-titanium dioxide (TiO2(B)), has been developed. The goal of this research is to utilize the nanocomposite design of rice husk-derived SiO2 and Sn nanoparticles self-assembled on TiO2(B) nanorods, Sn–SiO2@TiO2(B), through simple chemical route methods. Following that, the microstructure and electrochemical performance of as-prepared products were investigated. The major patterns of the X-ray diffraction technique can be precisely indexed as monoclinic TiO2(B). The patterns of SiO2 and Sn were found to be low in intensity since the particles were amorphous and in the nanoscale range, respectively. Small spherical particles, Sn and SiO2, attached to TiO2(B) nanorods were discovered. Therefore, the influence mechanism of Sn–SiO2@TiO2(B) fabrication was proposed. The Sn–SiO2@TiO2(B) anode material performed exceptionally well in terms of electrochemical and battery performance. The as-prepared electrode demonstrated outstanding stability over 500 cycles, with a high discharge capacity of ∼150 mA h g–1 at a fast-charging current of 5000 mA g–1 and a low internal resistance of around 250.0 Ω. The synthesized Sn–SiO2@TiO2(B) nanocomposites have a distinct structure, the potential for fast charging, safety in use, and good stability, indicating their use as promising and effective anode materials in better power batteries for the next-generation applications.",

        "abstract": "Silicon (Si) has attracted tremendous attention as a high-capacity anode material for next generation Li-ion batteries (LIBs); unfortunately, it suffers from poor cyclic stability due to excessive volume expansion and reduced electrical conductivity after repeated cycles. To circumvent these issues, we propose that Si can be complexed with electrically conductive Ti2O3 to significantly enhance the reversible capacity and cyclic stability of Si-based anodes. We prepared a ternary nanocomposite of Si/Ti2O3/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) using mechanical blending and subsequent thermal reduction of the Si, TiO2 nanoparticles, and rGO nanosheets. As a result, the obtained ternary nanocomposite exhibited a specific capacity of 985 mAh/g and a Coulombic efficiency of 98.4% after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA/g. Furthermore, these ternary nanocomposite anodes exhibited outstanding rate capability characteristics, even with an increased current density of 10 A/g. This excellent electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the improved electron and ion transport provided by the Ti2O3 phase within the Si domains and the structurally reinforced conductive framework comprised of the rGO nanosheets. Therefore, it is expected that our approach can also be applied to other anode materials to enable large reversible capacity, excellent cyclic stability, and good rate capability for high-performance LIBs.",

This article develops a capacity prediction model with uncertainty quantification for lithium-ion batteries and proposes a dynamic maintenance strategy that can help to make an optimized decision at each battery cycle stage. To be specific, after using the 1-D convolution neural network (1dCNN), deep representative features hidden in original measured signals are extracted. Then, the bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) is applied to estimate the battery capacities, while the quantile regression (QR) layer is embedded into the construction of the Bi-LSTM network to obtain the capacities for different quantiles. Next, the kernel density estimation (KDE) is utilized to derive the probability density of the predicted points at each battery cycle stage. Thus, the combination of 1dCNN, Bi-LSTM, QR, and KDE, named 1dCNN-BiLSTMQR-KDE, forms an efficacious capacity prediction model with reliable uncertainty management. Finally, the costs of different decisions at each battery cycle stage are evaluated, and the decision with the lower cost will be chosen. The whole proposition is verified on battery degradation datasets from NASA, and the comparison with other methods show that the proposed method is competitive.",

        "abstract": "Nickel-rich transition metal oxides is widely regarded as promising cathode materials for high energy density lithium-ion batteries for emerging applications in electric vehicles. However, achieving high energy density in Ni-rich cathodes is generally accompanied with substantial obstacles of lifetime and safety. The major issues of Ni-rich cathodes at high working potentials are originated from the unstable cathode-electrolyte interface, while the underlying mechanism of parasitic reactions to material degradation at the surface of cathode materials is not well understood. In this work, we report the parasitic-reaction-driven structural degradation in LiNi0.83Mn0.1Co0.07O2 cathode by altering interfacial chemistry by synthesizing cathode material in different environments. Our home-build high precision leakage current (HpLC) system verifies that Li2CO3 impurity generated in harsh synthesis environment is a nature root of electrolyte decomposition and parasitic reactions on Ni-rich cathodes. Different rates of parasitic reactions are strongly correlated to drastic discrepancy in electrochemical performance of Ni83 cathodes at different synthesis conditions. The post-mortem characterizations reveal that parasitic reactions promote severe rock-salt phase transformation with more Ni reduction and O deficiency at the surface of cathode materials. This study suggests the significance of developing impurity-free and mitigated parasitic reactions in Ni-rich transition metal oxides for enabling high energy density.\n \n Acknowledgement\n \n Research at the Argonne National Laboratory was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Advanced Manufacturing Office.

        "abstract": "Cobalt nanoparticle thin films were electrophoretically deposited on copper current collectors and were annealed into thin films of hollow Co3O4 nanoparticles. These thin films were directly used as the anodes of lithium ion batteries (LIBs) without the addition of conducting carbons and bonding agents. LIBs thus fabricated show high gravimetric capacities and long cycle lives. For ≈1.0 μm thick Co3O4 nanoparticle films the gravimetric capacities of the batteries were more than 800 mAh g−1 at a current rate of C/15, which is about 90% of the theoretical maximum. Additionally, the batteries were able to undergo 200 charge/discharge cycles at a relatively fast rate of C/5 and maintain 50% of the initial capacity. In order to understand the electrochemistry of lithiation in the context of nanoparticles, Raman spectra were collected at different stages of the electrode cycles to determine the chemical and structural changes in the nanomaterials. Our results indicate that initially the electrode nanoparticles were under significant strain and as the battery underwent many cycles of charging/discharging the nanoparticles experienced progressive strain relaxation.",

        "abstract": "Efficient parameter identification of electrochemical models is crucial for accurate monitoring and control of lithium-ion cells. This process becomes challenging when applied to complex models that rely on a considerable number of interdependent parameters that affect the output response. Gradient-based and metaheuristic optimization techniques, although previously employed for this task, are limited by their lack of robustness, high computational costs, and susceptibility to local minima. In this study, Bayesian Optimization is used for tuning the dynamic parameters of an electrochemical equivalent circuit battery model (E-ECM) for a nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC)-graphite cell. The performance of the Bayesian Optimization is compared with baseline methods based on gradient-based and metaheuristic approaches. The robustness of the parameter optimization method is tested by performing verification using an experimental drive cycle. The results indicate that Bayesian Optimization outperforms Gradient Descent and PSO optimization techniques, achieving reductions on average testing loss by 28.8% and 5.8%, respectively. Moreover, Bayesian optimization significantly reduces the variance in testing loss by 95.8% and 72.7%, respectively.",

While enabling the production of well-mixed slurry-cast electrodes with high silicon content (up to 95 wt %), this combination eliminates the well-known occurrence of capacity losses due to physical separation of the silicon and traditional inorganic conductive additives during repeated lithiation/delithiation processes. Using an in situ secondary doping treatment of the\n\n\nPEDOT\nPSS with small quantities of formic acid, electrodes containing 80 wt % SiNPs can be prepared with electrical conductivity as high as 4.2 S/cm. Even at the relatively high areal loading of 1 mg/cm(2), this system demonstrated a first cycle lithiation capacity of 3685 mA·h/g (based on the SiNP mass) and a first cycle efficiency of ∼78%. After 100 repeated cycles at 1 A/g this electrode was still able to store an impressive 1950 mA·h/g normalized to Si mass (∼75% capacity retention), corresponding to 1542 mA·h/g when the capacity is normalized by the total electrode mass. At the maximum electrode thickness studied (∼1.5 mg/cm(2)), a high areal capacity of 3 mA·h/cm(2) was achieved. Importantly, these electrodes are based on commercially available components and are produced by the standard slurry coating methods required for large-scale electrode production. Hence, the results presented here are highly relevant for the realization of commercial LiB negative electrodes that surpass the performance of current graphite-based negative electrode systems.",

This was achieved using electron diffraction tomography (EDT) in a sealed electrochemical cell with conventional liquid electrolyte (LP30) and LiFePO4 crystals, which have a well-documented charged structure to use as reference. In situ EDT in a liquid environment cell provides a viable alternative to in situ X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments due to the more local character of TEM, allowing for single crystal diffraction data to be obtained from multiphased powder samples and from submicrometer- to nanometer-sized particles. EDT is the first in situ TEM technique to provide information at the unit cell level in the liquid environment of a commercial TEM electrochemical cell. Its application to a wide range of electrochemical experiments in liquid environment cells and diverse types of crystalline materials can be envisaged.",

This is the first study reporting the recovery of spent LIB anode material and its application to heavy-metal-contaminated wastewater treatment. Characterizations using scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, and Fourier transform infrared showed that the adsorbent surface was coated with MnO2 ultrafine particles that served as the sorption mechanism to remove heavy-metal ions. In comparison to the raw artificial graphite (AG) powder, the MnO2-modified AG (MnO2-AG) exhibited a markedly improved removal capacity toward Pb(II), Cd(II), and Ag(I), whose removal rates reached as high as 99.9, 79.7, and 99.8%, respectively. The removal of the heavy metals by MnO2-AG was mainly through the ion exchange of hydroxyl groups. This study provides the possibility of synthesis of an efficient adsorbent by reusing the \"waste\", such as spent Li-ion batteries. It is an economic and environmentally friendly approach for both heavy-metal-contaminated water treatment and waste recycling.",

        "abstract": "Achieving zero grid power in systems that utilize solar photovoltaic (PV) energy is a challenging task. This is because of the varying power output of solar PV due to the changing weather conditions and the controls required for a three-phase system. A system that operates induction motor loads, such as in the water pumping plant, increases this difficulty due to their high starting currents and power requirements, which can cause large voltage dips in a grid-connected system, and can have an even larger impact on isolated ones. A battery energy storage system (BESS), consisting of a large lithium-ion battery, a bi-directional dc-dc converter and a bi-directional dc-ac converter is considered in this paper to normalize the output power. A model is developed to accurately simulate the motor loads and the control strategies to operate the system to consume zero grid power at all times. These strategies are designed to limit the transients in the system, as well as to mitigate voltage dips and swells to create a more robust micro-grid. The proposed strategies are then applied for use in a water pumping plant equipped with solar PV and BESS and the simulation results show that the proposed strategy is effective in ensuring that the plant can maintain a zero grid power consumption when sufficient capacities of the solar PV and BESS are available that can be allocated to generate and store the required energy to meet the varying load.",

        "abstract": "Simulation techniques are extensively used in vehicle performance evaluations, particularly for advanced vehicles such as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in HEVs, and battery electric vehicles. It is necessary that the parameters used in simulation models are estimated properly so that the simulations can produce results that are close to real-world behaviors. This paper suggests methodologies for estimating parameters for a lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery model by analyzing test data obtained from chassis dynamometer tests. A representative model based on a first-order equivalent circuit is used for the battery, and four main parameters of the model-source voltage, internal resistance, polarization resistance, and polarization capacitance-are obtained by characterizing the test results. The model is validated with the test data by applying the estimated parameters in the model, and the validation results show that the battery output voltage is calculated by the simulation model very well; 70% of simulations produce the output voltage within 1% of the root-mean-square error, as compared with the test data. Although the methodology cannot replace a conventional process that estimates the battery parameters from dedicated tests, the approach would be very feasible and save the effort and time needed to develop simulation models for Li-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Silicon (Si) is an attractive anode material for Li-ion batteries (LIBs) due to its high theoretical specific capacity. However, the solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation, caused by liquid electrolyte decomposition, often befalls Si electrodes. The SEI layer is less Li-ion conductive, which would significantly inhibit Li-ion transport and delay the reaction kinetics. Understanding the interaction between the SEI components and Li-ion diffusion is crucial for further improving the cycling performance of Si. Herein, different liquid electrolytes are applied to investigate the induced SEI components, structures, and their role in Li-ion transport. It is found that Si electrodes exhibit higher discharge capacities in LiClO4-based electrolytes than in LiPF6-based electrolytes. This behavior suggests that a denser and more conductive SEI layer is formed in LiClO4-based electrolytes. In addition, a coating of a Li3PO4 artificial SEI layer on Si suppresses the formation of natural SEI formation, leading to higher capacity retentions. Furthermore, galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurements are applied to calculate Li-ion diffusion coefficients, which are found in the range of 10–23–10–19 m2/s.",

This study employs qualitative methodologies to collect insights from 12 critical stakeholders in the automotive, mining, and recycling sectors and academia to examine the feasibility and advantages of establishing such an industry. We implemented purposeful and snowball sampling to guarantee an exhaustive array of viewpoints. Thematic analysis of the interview data reveals that LIB recycling has substantial social, environmental, and economic implications. The results emphasize the pressing necessity of recycling infrastructure to mitigate environmental impacts and attract investment. The economic feasibility and employment potential of LIB recycling is promising despite the early stage of the EV industry in South Africa. These potentials are influenced by EV adoption rates, technological advancements, regulatory frameworks, and industry growth. In this sector, employment opportunities are available in various phases: battery collection, transportation, disassembly, testing, mechanical crushing, hydrometallurgical processes, valuable metal recovery, manufacturing, reuse, research and development, and administrative roles. Each of these roles necessitates a unique set of skills. This interdisciplinary research investigates vital elements of economic growth, employment creation, environmental sustainability, policymaking, technological innovation, and global collaboration.

The performance was compared with a silicon drift detector (SDD), an energy-resolving semiconductor detector, and Compton profiles were measured for lithium and cobalt oxide powders relevant to lithium-ion battery research. Spectroscopic analysis of the measured Compton profiles demonstrates the high-sensitivity to the low-Z elements and oxidation states. The line shape analysis of the measured Compton profiles in comparison with computed Hartree-Fock profiles is usually limited by the resolution of the semiconductor detector. We have characterized an x-ray TES microcalorimeter detector for high-resolution Compton scattering experiments using a bending magnet source at the Advanced Photon Source with a double crystal monochromator, providing monochromatic photon energies near 27.5 keV. The momentum resolution below 0.16 atomic units (a.u.) was measured, yielding an improvement of more than a factor of 7 over a state-of-the-art SDD for the same scattering geometry. Furthermore, the lineshapes of narrow valence and broad core electron profiles of sealed lithium metal were clearly resolved using an x-ray TES compared to smeared and broadened lineshapes observed when using the SDD.

Three sandwich beams were manufactured with aluminum face skins adhesively bonded to cores consisting of unidirectional layers of lithium-ion battery anode and cathode materials stacked across the width of the beam so that their edges can be bonded to the face skins. This novel arrangement of the battery materials enables them to contribute significantly to the through-thickness shear rigidity of the beam. All three beams were tested structurally in three-point bending and one of the beams was also tested for electrochemical performance after being filled with electrolyte. The electrochemically tested beam demonstrated an energy density of 223 W h/L, which is comparable to typical lithium-ion batteries. Stiffness of all the beams was predictable within 10% using a first-order sandwich beam analysis, confirming the existence of composite behavior between the face skins provided by the novel core design. Electrochemical testing had only a minor effect on beam stiffness. The mechanical testing had no significant effect on the battery discharge capacity.

        "abstract": "TiNb2O7 has attracted extensive attention from lithium-ion battery researchers due to its superior specific capacity and safety. However, its poor ion conductivity and electron conductivity hinder its further development. To improve the ion/electron transport of TiNb2O7, we report that chlorine doping and oxygen vacancy engineering regulate the energy band and crystal structure simultaneously through a simple solid-phase method. NH4Cl was used to realize Cl- doping and oxygen vacancy production. A Rietveld refinement demonstrates an effective substitution of Cl in the O sites of Nb-O octahedra, with an enlarged crystal plane spacing. The oxygen vacancies provide more active sites for lithium intercalation. The diffusion coefficient of Li+ is inceased from 2.39 × 10-14 to 1.50 × 10-13 cm2 s-1, which reveals the positive influence of Cl- doping and oxygen vacancies on the promoted Li+ transport behavior. Charge compensation is introduced by the doping of Cl- and the generation of oxygen vacancies, leading to the formation of Ti3+ and Nb4+ and the adjustment of the electronic structure. DFT calculations reveal that TiNb2O7 with Cl- doping and an O vacancy shows a metallic property with a finite value at the Fermi level, which is conducive to electron transfer in the electrode material. Benefiting from these advantages, the modified TiNb2O7 presents superior rate performance with a commendable capacity of 172.82 mAh g-1 at 50 C.

        "abstract": "LiCoO2 is the prototypical cathode in lithium-ion batteries. Its crystal structure consists of Li+ and CoO2- layers that alternate along the hexagonal <0001> axis. It is well established that the ionic and electronic conduction are anisotropic, but little is known regarding the heat transport. We analyse the phonon dispersion and lifetimes using anharmonic lattice dynamics based on quantum-chemical force constants. Around room temperature, the thermal conductivity in the hexagonal ab plane of the layered cathode is ~6 times higher than that along the c axis. An upper limit to the average thermal conductivity at T = 300 K of 38.5 W/m/K is set by short phonon lifetimes associated with anharmonic interactions within the octahedral face-sharing CoO2- network. Observations of conductivity < 10 W/m/K can be understood by additional scattering channels including grain boundaries in polycrystalline samples. The impact on thermal processes in lithium ion batteries is discussed.",

        "abstract": "Silicon is an important anode material for lithium-ion batteries because of its high theoretical capacity. However, the large volume expansion of silicon anodes hinders its commercial utilization. As an alternative, silicon oxycarbides (SiOCs) mitigate the expansion of anodes during lithiation, and the synthesis of SiOC beads from silanes is rather simple and at a low cost. In this study, we compared three different reactor setups for making the SiOC beads from methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS) and found that the control of residence time was crucial. Thereby, the batch reactor turned out to be the easiest one for making monodispersed beads. We also reduced the O/Si ratio of the SiOC beads by adding dimethyldimethoxysilane (DMDMS) for better battery performance. The first-cycle delithiation capacity of the most stable material was over 1796 mA h/g, with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 82%, while the capacity retention after 170 cycles was 67% (992 mA h/g) at a charging rate of 2 A/g in the potential range of 0.01–3 V. This was among the best of the reported data so far for the SiOC beads from MTMS.",

However, machine learning can be computationally intensive. Linear approaches are faster but have previously been too inflexible for successful prognosis. For both techniques, the choice and quality of the inputs is a limiting factor of performance. Piecewise-linear models, combined with automated feature selection, offer a fast and flexible alternative without being as computationally intensive as machine learning. Here, a piecewise-linear approach to battery health forecasting was compared to a Gaussian process regression tool and found to perform equally well. The input feature selection process demonstrated the benefit of limiting the correlation between inputs. Further trials found that the piecewise-linear approach was robust to changing input size and availability of training data.",

        "abstract": "Solid-state batteries (SSBs), which have high energy density and are safe, are recognized as an important field of study. However, the poor interfacial contact with high resistance, the dendrite problem, and the volume change of the metallic lithium anode prevent the use of SSBs. Li0.5La0.5TiO3 (LLTO) particles and molten lithium were used to create a high-performance LLTO-Li composite lithium with a sequential ion-conducting phase. With garnet electrolytes, this lithium has better wettability and reduced surface tension. To compensate for the lithium depletion that occurs during stripping, the Li-Ti phase with a high ionic diffusion coefficient that forms in the anode can rapidly transport lithium from the bulk to the solid-state interface, ensuring tight interface contact, preventing the formation of gaps, and homogenizing the current and Li+ flux. The LLTO-Li| LLZTO| LLTO-Li symmetric cell exhibits a good cyclic stability of 1000 h at room temperature, a low interfacial resistance of 22 Ω cm2, and a high critical current density of 1.2 mA cm-2. Furthermore, fully built cells with a LiFePO4 cathode showed outstanding cycling performance, maintaining 95% of their capacity after 900 cycles at 1 C and 92% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 2 C.",

Lithium was inserted stepwise into TCNQ thin films by exposure to lithium vapour and analysis by photoemission (PES) was performed. The evolution of core levels, electronic structure and Fermi-level with increasing lithium insertion into TCNQ was monitored. The results show that lithium insertion takes place under integer charge transfer and polaron formation. We find no indication of deterioration of the material. The consequences of evolution of electronic structure and polaron formation for electrode potential and kinetic properties of the material are discussed.",

However, the notorious shuttle effect of polysulfides intermediates severely hinders its practical application. Herein, a novel 2D mesoporous N-doped carbon nanosheet with confined bimetallic CoNi nanoparticles sandwiched graphene (mNC-CoNi@rGO) is successfully fabricated through a coordinating interface polymerization and micelle mediated co-assembly strategy. mNC-CoNi@rGO serves as a robust host material that endows lithium-sulfur batteries with a high reversible capacity of 1115 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C after 100 cycles, superior rate capability, and excellent cycling stability with 679.2 mAh g-1 capacity retention over 700 cycles at 1 C. With sulfur contents of up to 5.0 mg cm-2 , the area capacity remains to be 5.1 mAh cm-2 after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. The remarkable performance is further resolved via a series of experimental characterizations combined with density functional theory calculations. These results reveal that the ordered mesoporous N-doped carbon-encapsulated graphene framework acts as the ion/electron transport highway with excellent electrical conductivity, while bimetallic CoNi nanoparticles enhance the polysulfides adsorption and catalytic conversion that simultaneously accelerate the multiphase sulfur/polysulfides/sulfides conversion and inhibit the polysulfides shuttle.",

This study presents a novel hybrid approach for predicting nonlinear and nonsmooth battery capacity sequences. To develop this approach, first, the original battery capacity sequence was adaptively decomposed through northern goshawk optimization (NGO)-variational mode decomposition (VMD). NGO-VMD could efficiently extract useful information at different scales and could considerably reduce the complexity of the battery capacity sequence. Second, the decomposed sequences were grouped into high- and low-frequency components on the basis of the over-zero rate. A convolutional neural network-bidirectional long short-term memory (CNN-BiLSTM) model was then constructed to predict the low-frequency components, and a temporal convolutional network-attention mechanism-deep neural network (TCN-Attention-DNN) model was developed to predict the high-frequency components. In addition, a tensor-based transfer learning approach was employed to predict the low-frequency components of capacity sequences from same-type batteries. The RUL prediction errors of the proposed approach did not exceed two cycles, which was fewer than those of other comparable approaches. Accordingly, the proposed approach has favorable generalizability and robustness.",

The limited electrochemical stability windows (ESWs) of aqueous electrolytes are significantly widened by WiSEs. However, the actual ESWs are lower than predicted as the interphase with WiSEs is not as stable as the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in conventional lithium-ion batteries. Therefore, identifying the interface state in WiSEs is vital to understanding their electrochemical behavior. Here, the structure of the lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) electrolyte near the interface of the carbon electrode (Ketjen black) was evaluated by experimental methods (neutron diffraction, Raman, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results reveal that the introduction of carbon electrodes increases the size of the anionic nanoclusters and enhances the microphase separation at the interface. The MD simulations show that cation-π interactions are responsible for the evolution of anionic nanoclusters at the electrode interface. Moreover, lower charge transfer resistance is achieved at carbon-based electrodes due to the specific interface state. Our findings provide a strategy for introducing cation-π interactions between electrodes and electrolytes to improve the electrochemical performance.",

        "title": "(Invited) Advanced Redox Flow Batteries: Process and Design Innovation Opportunities",
        "abstract": "Large-scale electric-energy-storage (EES) systems have the potential to transform the electric grid, especially long-duration energy storage (LDES) solutions [1]. However, the economic requirements for LDES systems are more challenging than those for EES applications with shorter discharge durations, since the value proposition for most LDES applications tends to be significantly lower on a normalized basis (i.e., $/kWh of EES capacity). EES systems with independent power and energy components, e.g., pumped-storage hydro (PSH), redox flow batteries (RFBs), and reversible fuel cells (RFCs) have a major inherent cost advantage, since one can readily increase the energy/power ratio by selectively adding more energy capacity, without the added cost of excessive power components. RFBs also have other unique attributes that make this battery architecture ideally suited for grid-scale LDES, namely: long cycle life even with deep cycles, inherently superior safety [2], good round-trip energy efficiency (i.e., compared to RFCs), and simplified recyclability due to the separated components. A rigorous techno-economic analysis (TEA) model has shown that RFBs can enable LDES systems with lower capital cost than other types of batteries at comparable production volumes [3]. However, production volumes of RFBs are currently substantially lower than some other types of batteries, especially lithium-ion batteries. This same TEA model also projects that the capital cost of all-vanadium RFBs (VRFBs) at low production volumes is > $500/kWh. Therefore, what is needed to accelerate the commercialization of VRFBs are innovations that can potentially improve capital costs at low production volumes [4]. This invited talk will focus on some potentially near-term possibilities; namely, those that do not necessarily require new materials. This includes: 1) high performance RFB cells [5], 2) a variety of advanced RFB manufacturing processes, including innovative electrolyte-purification [6] and electrolyte-shipping processes [7], 3) alternative state-of-charge (SOC) measurement methods [8], 4) simple RFB performance diagnostics [9], 5) novel RFB system architectures (e.g., [10]), and 6) business-model innovations [11].\n \n References\n \n \n P.

        "abstract": "\n The mechanical properties and thermal conductivity of a composite based on crumpled graphene flakes and nickel nanoparticles obtained by high-temperature hydrostatic compression are investigated by the method of molecular dynamics. The pores of the graphene matrix of the composite are filled with nickel nanoparticles of different sizes (respectively, different contents of Ni - 8, 16 and 24 at.%). It was found that an increase in the amount of nickel on the one hand increases the thermal conductivity of the composite, and on the other hand reduces its strength, since strength is determined by the presence of a graphene grid, and thermal conductivity is determined by the presence of a conductive metal. The obtained results on thermophysical properties combined with high mechanical characteristics of Ni/graphene composites allow us to predict their application for the manufacture of new flexible electronics, supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries.\n",

        "abstract": "Solid state lithium conductors are attracting much attention for their potential applications to solid-state batteries and supercapacitors of high energy density to overcome safety issues and irreversible capacity loss of the currently commercialized ones. Recently, we discovered a new class of lithium super ionic conductors based on lithium borohydride (LiBH(4)). LiBH(4) was found to have conductivity as high as 10(-2) Scm(-1) accompanied by orthorhombic to hexagonal phase transition above 115 degrees C. Polarization to the lithium metal electrode was shown to be extremely low, providing a versatile anode interface for the battery application. However, the high transition temperature of the superionic phase has limited its applications. Here we show that a chemical modification of LiBH(4) can stabilize the superionic phase even below room temperature. By doping of lithium halides, high conductivity can be obtained at room temperature. Both XRD and NMR confirmed room-temperature stabilization of superionic phase for LiI-doped LiBH(4). The electrochemical measurements showed a great advantage of this material as an extremely lightweight lithium electrolyte for batteries of high energy density. This material will open alternative opportunities for the development of solid ionic conductors other than previously known lithium conductors.",

        "abstract": "Cation mixing in positive electrode materials for rechargeable lithium ion batteries, LiNixMn2-xO4 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.5) and Li0.21Ni0.7Mn1.64O4-δ (denoted as x = 0.7), is analyzed by high-angular-resolution electron-channeling X-ray/electron spectroscopy (HARECXS/HARECES) techniques, using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Mixing between the tetrahedral lithium sites and the octahedral transition metal sites is quantified, and the site-dependent valence states of the transition metals are examined. In the non-doped (x = 0) sample, Mn was found to occupy only octahedral sites as either Mn(3+) or Mn(4+) For x = 0.2-0.7, some of the nickel ions (6-13% depending on x) occupy tetrahedral anti-sites. All the nickel ions are in the divalent state, regardless of the occupation site. For x = 0.2 and 0.7, manganese ions occupy both octahedral and tetrahedral sites; those in the octahedral sites are tetravalent, while the tetrahedral sites contain a mixture of divalent and trivalent ions. For x = 0.5, manganese occupies only the octahedral sites, with all ions determined to be in the tetravalent state (within experimental accuracy). All the samples substantially satisfied the local charge neutrality conditions. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using HARECXS/HARECES for quantitative analysis of the atomic configuration and valence states in lithium manganese oxide spinel materials.",

        "title": "Bicontinuous phase separation of lithium-ion battery electrodes for ultrahigh areal loading",
        "abstract": "Significance Increasing the thickness of battery electrodes is an attractive approach to reduce the fraction of battery parts that do not store energy, such as current collectors and separators. However, the fabrication of thick electrodes holds challenges of its own such as cracking or flaking during the electrode production and limitations in ion and electron transport. To address the latter, advanced electrode templating techniques have been suggested, but these techniques are not scalable. In this work, ultrathick electrodes are fabricated on a pilot-scale roll-to-roll tool using a thermally induced phase segregation process. This electrode structuring method creates a bicontinuous electrolyte and electrode network with excellent ion and electron transport reducing the charge-transport challenges in thick electrodes. Ultrathick battery electrodes are appealing as they reduce the fraction of inactive battery parts such as current collectors and separators. However, thick electrodes are difficult to dry and tend to crack or flake during production. Moreover, the electrochemical performance of thick electrodes is constrained by ion and electron transport as well as fast capacity degradation. Here, we report a thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) process for fabricating thick Li-ion battery electrodes, which incorporates the electrolyte directly in the electrode and alleviates the need to dry the electrode. The proposed TIPS process creates a bicontinuous electrolyte and electrode network with excellent ion and electron transport, respectively, and consequently achieves better rate performance. Using this process, electrodes with areal capacities of more than 30 mAh/cm2 are demonstrated. Capacity retentions of 87% are attained over 500 cycles in full cells with 1-mm-thick anodes and cathodes. Finally, we verified the scalability of the TIPS process by coating thick electrodes continuously on a pilot-scale roll-to-roll coating tool.",

        "abstract": "Electrodes with three-dimensional (3D) nanostructure are expected to improve the energy and power densities per footprint area of lithium ion microbatteries. Herein, we report a large-scale synthesis of a SnO(2)/α-Fe(2)O(3) composite nanotube array on a stainless steel substrate via a ZnO nanowire array as an in situ sacrificial template without using any strong acid or alkali. Importantly, both SnO(2) and α-Fe(2)O(3) contribute to the lithium storage, and the hybridization of SnO(2) and α-Fe(2)O(3) into an integrated nanotube structure provides them with an elegant synergistic effect when participating in electrochemical reactions. Large areal capacities and good rate capability are demonstrated for such a composite nanotube array. Particularly noteworthy is that the areal capacities (e.g. 1.289 mAh cm(-2) at a current rate of 0.1 mA cm(-2)) are much larger than those of many previous thin-film/3D microbattery electrodes. Our work suggests the possibility of further improving the areal capacity/energy density of 3D microelectrodes by designing ordered hybrid nanostructure arrays.",

        "abstract": "High-Ni layered oxides are promising next-generation cathodes for lithium-ion batteries owing to their high capacity and lower cost. However, as the Ni content increases over 70 %, they have a high dynamic affinity towards moisture and CO2 in ambient air, primarily reacting to form LiOH, Li2 CO3 , and LiHCO3 on the surface, which is commonly termed \"residual lithium\". Air exposure occurs after synthesis as it is common practice to handle and store them under ambient conditions. The air exposure leads to significant performance losses, and hampers the electrode fabrication, impeding their practical viability. Herein, we show that substituting a small amount of Al for Ni in the crystal lattice notably improves the chemical stability against air by limiting the formation of LiOH, Li2 CO3 , LiHCO3 , and NiO in the near-surface region. The Al-doped high-Ni oxides display a high capacity retention with excellent rate capability and cycling stability after being exposed to air for 30 days.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as potential alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), particularly for large-scale applications. Alloy-type anode materials for sodium-ion batteries are esteemed as prospective candidate materials for sodium-ion anodes, owing to their elevated theoretical capacity, heightened utilization efficiency, and minimal production of insulating byproducts. However, the severe volume changes and sluggish ion diffusion kinetics can lead to irreversible particle fragmentation and reaggregation phenomena, ultimately resulting in electrode degradation. Additionally, repetitive volume changes can cause an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). This study presents the synthesis of chloride-ion-modulated bimetallic SnSb/C nanoparticle anode materials, highlighting the following advantages: (i) Designing a bimetallic SnSb alloy structure serves to buffer the structural stresses generated during sodium insertion/extraction processes, effectively mitigating particle fracture phenomena induced by electrode material expansion/contraction. (ii) Nanostructuring both alloy materials enables the full utilization of active materials and shortens diffusion pathways, thereby significantly enhancing the diffusion rate of sodium ions. (iii) Introducing a carbonaceous matrix serves to alleviate self-agglomeration phenomena of the material during charge/discharge cycles, enhancing the material's conductivity and structural stability. (iv) Utilizing chloride-ion interface modification to achieve a chloride-rich solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) enhances battery performance.",

        "abstract": "Vacancy and interface engineering are regarded as effective strategies to modulate the electronic structure and enhance the activity of metal chalcogenides. However, the practical application of metal chalcogenides in lithium−sulfur (Li−S) batteries is limited by their low conductivity, rapid decline in catalytic activity, and large volume variation during the discharging/charging process. Herein, bimetal sulfide (CoZn‐S) nanosheet arrays with sulfur vacancies and dense heterointerfaces are proposed to accelerate sulfur conversion and improve the performance of Li−S batteries. Systematic investigations reveal that sulfur‐vacancy and build‐in interfacial field in CoZn‐S facilitate the electron transfer and regulate the electronic structure. The well‐designed 3D nanosheet array structures shorten the ion‐transport pathway and inhibit the volume fluctuation of CoZn‐S during the electrocatalysis process. Density functional theory studies confirm that the built‐in interfacial field and sulfur vacancy can promote the thermodynamic formation and decomposition of Li2S, thus improving their intrinsic activity.",

        "abstract": "The development in the miniaturized - smart electric and electronic gadgets with the advancement in technologies has dramatically enhanced the demand for cobalt free-high energy density batteries. Among various choice of high-performance cathode materials Ni substituted LiMn2O4 spinel of composition LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 (LMNO) has proved to be one of the solutions to yield a high-performance high-energy density battery which can operate at a higher potential window. Ultra - thin films of LMNO fabricated by Pulsed laser deposition method at 600 °C substrate temperature using 2000 pulses. LMNO films fabricated on SrTiO3 (STO) and stainless steel (SS) substrates are employed for a detailed structural and electrochemical performance analysis. Disordered phase corresponding to fd3m space group of LMNO thin film exhibits better electrochemical performance compared to the ordered phase. Phase formation of LMNO thin films are studied employing X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy methods. The morphology obtained for the film of thickness 41.63 nm identified from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images clearly reveals the effect of growth conditions such as substrate temperature and base pressure on the growth behavior of these films. Since the electrochemical data obtained for the films are area limited, the capacity of the ultra-thin film is significantly low and can be ameliorate by controlling the area. Kinetic study of LMNO film reveals that the lithium diffusion during the charge storage mechanism resembles to a diffusion-limited process similar to a faradic process. The cycling stability and rate capability at different current densities of LMNO thin film electrodes are further investigated. Charge discharge profile for both higher (25, 50, 75, 100 and 125 mA) and lower (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 mA) current densities are obtained and subjected for 500 cycles. The thin film electrode shows a stable profile for 500 cycles. Areal discharge capacity of 1.3 μAh/cm2 is observed at a higher current density while at lower current density an areal discharge capacity obtained is 2.13 μAh/cm2 with a coulombic efficiency of around 80% and 96% respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies carried out on LMNO films before and after cycle shows a strong contribution of charge-transfer resistance along with film resistance and solution resistance and the equivalent circuit model for the same is evolved. Present studies indicates that LMNO ultra-thin films can be employed as a cathode layer for fabricating the all-solid thin film micro-batteries for energy applications.\n \n \n \n \n \n Figure 1\n",

        "abstract": "As demand for energy storage expands, securing reliable supply-chains for raw battery materials is critical in mitigating the threats of delayed manufacturing and inflated manufacturing costs. These issues have pushed researchers and industry to consider alternative sources for traditional lithium-ion battery materials, such as graphite. Commonly available sources of graphite for Li-ion anodes include natural graphite and petroleum coke derived synthetic graphite. While many carbon sources have been studied, most require complicated processing and result in sub-par graphite anode materials. This talk highlights raw coal and coal derived materials as promising graphite sources thanks to their abundance of sp2 hybridized carbon, resulting in simpler processing, and low material costs.\n We show that coal derived graphite can be implemented as a lithium-ion anode, however, many chemical, microstructural, and morphological considerations are necessary to compare with commercial graphite performance. We will experimentally compare the morphology at the microstructure for graphite from various carbon sources, and then apply the virtual microstructure analysis method as detailed by Lopata et al to quantify potential differences between the anode microstructures with respect to effective active material particle size (diffusion length calculation), the electrochemical surface area, and the tortuosity of the liquid phase domain. These calculations from representative 3D microstructures can then be extended to a porous electrode model as detailed in Garrick et al to probe the impact in ionic, kinetic, and ohmic losses in the system.\n References \n \n Joseph S.

Compounds such as Li[Li0.2Ni0.2Mn0.6]O2 exhibit a capacity to store charge in excess of the transition metal redox reactions. The additional capacity occurs at and above 4.5 V versus Li(+)/Li. The capacity at 4.5 V is dominated by oxidation of the O(2-) anions accounting for ∼0.43 e(-)/formula unit, with an additional 0.06 e(-)/formula unit being associated with O loss from the lattice. In contrast, the capacity above 4.5 V is mainly O loss, ∼0.08 e(-)/formula. The O redox reaction involves the formation of localized hole states on O during charge, which are located on O coordinated by (Mn(4+)/Li(+)). The results have been obtained by combining operando electrochemical mass spec on (18)O labeled Li[Li0.2Ni0.2Mn0.6]O2 with XANES, soft X-ray spectroscopy, resonant inelastic X-ray spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Finally the general features of O redox are described with discussion about the role of comparatively ionic (less covalent) 3d metal-oxygen interaction on anion redox in lithium rich cathode materials.",

Introducing a one-dimensional coordination compound can keep organic active substances insoluble in the electrolyte during the charging and discharging processes, providing a facile and general new system for further studies. The results show that both the aromatic ligand and the metal center can participate in lithium storage simultaneously, illustrating a new energy storage mechanism that has been well-characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry.

        "title": "An Unprecedented Case: A Low Specific Surface Area Anatase/N-Doped Carbon Nanocomposite Derived from a New Single Source Precursor Affords Fast and Stable Lithium Storage.",
        "abstract": "A nanocomposite of ultrafine anatase nanoparticles (<5 nm) embedded N-doped carbon (TiO2-NPs/NC) with a relatively low specific surface area was successfully synthesized by in situ pyrolysis of a new and cheap single source precursor of (H2en)3[Ti4(O2)4(Hcit)2(cit)2]·12H2O (en = ethylenediamine and H4cit = citric acid) under 550 °C and an inert atmosphere. The precursor in crystalline state was isolated from an aqueous solution containing of titanium butoxide, citric acid, hydrogen peroxide, and ethylenediamine and was characterized. The crystal structure was determined by X-ray single crystal diffraction. To our surprise, the low surface area TiO2-NPs/NC exhibits a high specific capacity, superior rate capability, excellent cycle performance, and good processability as a negative material for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). A large reversible capacity of 360 and 125 mA h g-1 and a high Coulombic efficiency (the average value is ∼99.8%) could be kept even after 1000 cycles under a current density of 0.3 and 6 A g-1, respectively. An analysis of the voltammetric sweep data shows that the pseudocapacitive behavior occurred at the surface of the material and the lithium intercalation processes contribute to the total stored charge, resulting in the high capacity of the TiO2-NPs/NC nanocomposite. The potentiostatic intermittent titration technique used to determine the lithium ion diffusion (DLi+) suggested the TiO2-NPs/NC nanocomposite displays a high DLi+. In addition, the high electric conductivity provided by the NC substrate and the ultrafine anatase particles can mitigate the diffusion path for electrons and ions and tolerate higher strain, and thus effectively decrease pulverization and improve the rate and cycle performance. In particular, the observed superior lithium storage properties, resulting from the low surface area nanocomposite with ultrafine nanoparticles embedded NC substrate, are expected to have fundamental and practical implications for the preparation of high performance electrodes in LIBs or other cells.",

        "title": "Optimizing the Ion Conductivity and Mechanical Stability of Polymer Electrolyte Membranes Designed for Use in Lithium Ion Batteries: Combining Imidazolium-Containing Poly(ionic liquids) and Poly(propylene carbonate)",
        "abstract": "State-of-the-art Li batteries suffer from serious safety hazards caused by the reactivity of lithium and the flammable nature of liquid electrolytes. This work develops highly efficient solid-state electrolytes consisting of imidazolium-containing polyionic liquids (PILs) and lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI). By employing PIL/LiTFSI electrolyte membranes blended with poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC), we addressed the problem of combining ionic conductivity and mechanical properties in one material. It was found that PPC acts as a mechanically reinforcing component that does not reduce but even enhances the ionic conductivity. While pure PILs are liquids, the tricomponent PPC/PIL/LiTFSI blends are rubber-like materials with a Young’s modulus in the range of 100 MPa. The high mechanical strength of the material enables fabrication of mechanically robust free-standing membranes. The tricomponent PPC/PIL/LiTFSI membranes have an ionic conductivity of 10−6 S·cm−1 at room temperature, exhibiting conductivity that is two orders of magnitude greater than bicomponent PPC/LiTFSI membranes. At 60 °C, the conductivity of PPC/PIL/LiTFSI membranes increases to 10−5 S·cm−1 and further increases to 10−3 S·cm−1 in the presence of plasticizers. Cyclic voltammetry measurements reveal good electrochemical stability of the tricomponent PIL/PPC/LiTFSI membrane that potentially ranges from 0 to 4.5 V vs. Li/Li+. The mechanically reinforced membranes developed in this work are promising electrolytes for potential applications in solid-state batteries.",

        "abstract": "A sound way to deliver power Implanted medical devices, such as pacemakers and neurological stimulators, require a source of power, usually in the form of a battery. If a battery is implanted with the device, replacing it would require additional surgery. On the other hand, external power packs are prone to lead to infections where their wires enter the body. Hinchet et al. describe a triboelectric generator that can convert externally applied ultrasound into an internal electricity source capable of delivering sufficient energy to recharge a battery on a daily basis. Science, this issue p. 491 An implantable triboelectric generator can harvest ultrasound through skin and liquids to supply power to medical implants. A major challenge for implantable medical systems is the inclusion or reliable delivery of electrical power. We use ultrasound to deliver mechanical energy through skin and liquids and demonstrate a thin implantable vibrating triboelectric generator able to effectively harvest it. The ultrasound can induce micrometer-scale displacement of a polymer thin membrane to generate electrical energy through contact electrification. We recharge a lithium-ion battery at a rate of 166 microcoulombs per second in water. The voltage and current generated ex vivo by ultrasound energy transfer reached 2.4 volts and 156 microamps under porcine tissue. These findings show that a capacitive triboelectric electret is the first technology able to compete with piezoelectricity to harvest ultrasound in vivo and to power medical implants.",

        "title": "Lithium-Ion Battery Capacity Estimation: A Method Based on Visual Cognition",
        "abstract": "This study introduces visual cognition into Lithium-ion battery capacity estimation. The proposed method consists of four steps. First, the acquired charging current or discharge voltage data in each cycle are arranged to form a two-dimensional image. Second, the generated image is decomposed into multiple spatial-frequency channels with a set of orientation subbands by using non-subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT). NSCT imitates the multichannel characteristic of the human visual system (HVS) that provides multiresolution, localization, directionality, and shift invariance. Third, several time-domain indicators of the NSCT coefficients are extracted to form an initial high-dimensional feature vector. Similarly, inspired by the HVS manifold sensing characteristic, the Laplacian eigenmap manifold learning method, which is considered to reveal the evolutionary law of battery performance degradation within a low-dimensional intrinsic manifold, is used to further obtain a low-dimensional feature vector. Finally, battery capacity degradation is estimated using the geodesic distance on the manifold between the initial and the most recent features. Verification experiments were conducted using data obtained under different operating and aging conditions. Results suggest that the proposed visual cognition approach provides a highly accurate means of estimating battery capacity and thus offers a promising method derived from the emerging field of cognitive computing.",

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the superacid-treated WS2 suggests the formation of W-O type bonds, signifying oxidation of tungsten and reduction of the sulfur phase. Thermogravimetric analysis showed a three-phase weight-loss pattern, suggesting acid functionalization of WS2 surfaces. We also studied the electrochemical behavior of an acid-treated WS2 anode in a lithium half-cell configuration that showed a three-step charge-discharge behavior, characteristic of a conversion reaction. The electrochemical capacity was 118 mAh/g after 50 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Due to their safety and sustainability, polysaccharides such as cellulose and chitosan have great potential to be the matrix of gel polymer electrolytes (GPE) for lithium-based batteries. However, they easily form hydrogels due to the large numbers of hydrophilic hydroxyl or amino functional groups within their macromolecules. Therefore, a polysaccharide-based amphiphilic gel, or organogel, is urgently necessary to satisfy the anhydrous requirement of lithium ion batteries. In this study, a PEGylated chitosan was initially designed using a chemical grafting method to make an GPE for lithium ion batteries. The significantly improved affinity of PEGylated chitosan to organic liquid electrolyte makes chitosan as a GPE for lithium ion batteries possible. A reasonable ionic conductivity (1.12 × 10−3 S cm−1) and high lithium ion transport number (0.816) at room temperature were obtained by replacing commercial battery separator with PEG-grafted chitosan gel film. The assembled Li/GPE/LiFePO4 coin cell also displayed a high initial discharge capacity of 150.8 mA h g−1. The PEGylated chitosan-based GPE exhibits great potential in the field of energy storage.",

Quantitative measurement of key structural parameters of lithium‐ion battery electrode microstructures will enable optimization as well as motivate systematic numerical studies for the improvement of battery performance. With the rapid development of 3‐D imaging techniques, quantitative assessment of 3‐D microstructures from 2‐D image sections by stereological methods appears outmoded; however, in spite of the proliferation of tomographic imaging techniques, it remains significantly easier to obtain two‐dimensional (2‐D) data sets. In this study, stereological prediction and three‐dimensional (3‐D) analysis techniques for quantitative assessment of key geometric parameters for characterizing battery electrode microstructures are examined and compared. Lithium‐ion battery electrodes were imaged using synchrotron‐based X‐ray tomographic microscopy. For each electrode sample investigated, stereological analysis was performed on reconstructed 2‐D image sections generated from tomographic imaging, whereas direct 3‐D analysis was performed on reconstructed image volumes. The analysis showed that geometric parameter estimation using 2‐D image sections is bound to be associated with ambiguity and that volume‐based 3‐D characterization of nonconvex, irregular and interconnected particles can be used to more accurately quantify spatially‐dependent parameters, such as tortuosity and pore‐phase connectivity.",

        "abstract": "The increasing global market size of high-energy storage devices due to the boom in electric vehicles and portable electronics has caused the battery industry to produce a lot of waste lithium-ion batteries. The liberation and de-agglomeration of cathode material are the necessary procedures to improve the recycling derived from spent lithium-ion batteries, as well as enabling the direct recycling pathway. In this study, the supercritical (SC) CO2 was innovatively adapted to enable the recycling of spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) based on facilitating the interaction with a binder and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) co-solvent. The results show that the optimum experimental conditions to liberate the cathode particles are processing at a temperature of 70 °C and 80 bar pressure for a duration of 20 min. During the treatment, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) was dissolved in the SC fluid system and collected in the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), as detected by the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR). The liberation yield of the cathode from the current collector reaches 96.7% under optimal conditions and thus, the cathode particles are dispersed into smaller fragments. Afterwards, PVDF can be precipitated and reused. In addition, there is no hydrogen fluoride (HF) gas emission due to binder decomposition in the suggested process. The proposed SC-CO2 and co-solvent system effectively separate the PVDF from Li-ion battery electrodes. Thus, this approach is promising as an alternative pre-treatment method due to its efficiency, relatively low energy consumption, and environmental benign features.",

        "title": "Understanding SEI evolution during the cycling test of anode-free lithium-metal batteries with LiDFOB salt",
        "abstract": "Anode-free lithium-metal batteries (AFLMBs) have the potential to double the energy density of Li-ion batteries, but face the challenges of mossy dendritic lithium plating and an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Previous studies have shown that the AFLMBs with an electrolyte containing lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) salt outperform those with lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6), but the mechanism behind this improvement is not fully understood. In this study, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profile analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were conducted to investigate the SEI on plated Li from the two conducting salts and their evolution in Cu‖NMC full cells during cycling. XPS results revealed that an inorganic-rich SEI layer is formed in the cell with LiDFOB-based electrolyte, with a low carbon/oxygen ratio of 0.56 compared to 1.42 in the LiPF6-based cell. With the inorganic-rich SEI, a dense electroplated Li with a shining surface on the Cu substrate can be retained after ten cycles. The inorganic-rich SEI enhances the reversibility of Li plating and stripping, with a high average CE of ∼98% and a stable charge/discharge voltage profile. The changes in SEI resistance and cathode electrolyte interphase resistance are more prominent compared to the changes in solution and charge transfer resistances, which further validate the role of the passivation films on Li deposits and NMC cathode surfaces in stabilizing AFLMB cycling performance.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we demonstrate a general lithium-ion battery electrode fabrication method for colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) using electrophoretic deposition (EPD). Our process is capable of forming robust electrodes from copper sulfide, manganese sulfide, and germanium NPs without the use of additives such as polymeric binders and conductive agents. After EPD, we show two postprocessing treatments ((NH4)2S and inert atmosphere heating) to effectively remove surfactant ligands and create a linked network of particles. The NP films fabricated by this simple process exhibit excellent electrochemical performance as lithium-ion battery electrodes. Additive-free Cu(2-x)S and MnS NP films show well-defined plateaus at ∼1.7 V, demonstrating potential for use as cathode electrodes. Because of the absence of additives in the NP film, this additive-free NP film is an ideal template for ex situ analyses of the particles to track particle morphology changes and deterioration as a result of Li ion cycling. To this end, we perform a size-dependent investigation of Cu(2-x)S NPs and demonstrate that there is no significant relationship between size and capacity when comparing small (3.8 nm), medium (22 nm), and large (75 nm) diameter Cu(2-x)S NPs up to 50 cycles; however, the 75 nm NPs show higher Coulombic efficiency. Ex situ TEM analysis suggests that Cu(2-x)S NPs eventually break into smaller particles (<10 nm), explaining a weak correlation between size and performance. We also report for the first time on additive-free Ge NP films, which show stable capacities for up to 50 cycles at 750 mAh/g.",

        "abstract": "Magnesium batteries are a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries due to the widespread abundance of magnesium and its high specific volumetric energy capacity. Ethereal solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) are commonly used for magnesium-ion electrolytes due to their chemical compatibility with magnesium metal, but the volatile nature of THF is a concern for practical application. Herein, we investigate magnesium bis(hexamethyldisilazide) plus aluminum chloride (Mg(HMDS)2-AlCl3) electrolytes in THF, diglyme, and tetraglyme at varying temperature. We find that, despite the higher thermal stability of the glyme-based electrolytes, THF-based electrolytes have better reversibility at room temperature. Deposition/stripping efficiency is found to be a strong function of temperature. Diglyme-based Mg(HMDS)2-AlCl3 electrolytes are found to not exchange as quickly as THF and tetraglyme, stabilizing AlCl2+ and facilitating undesired aluminum deposition. Raman spectroscopy, 27Al NMR, and mass spectrometry are used to identify solution speciation.",

        "abstract": "As a power source for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), lithium-ion batteries play an important role in ensuring AUVs’ electric power propulsion performance. An accurate state of charge (SOC) estimation method is the key to achieving energy optimization for lithium-ion batteries. Due to the complicated ocean environments, traditional filtering methods cannot effectively estimate the SOC of lithium-ion batteries in an AUV. Based on the standard extended Kalman filter (EKF), an adaptive iterative extended Kalman filter (AIEKF) method for the SOC in an AUV is proposed to address the traditional filter’s problems, such as low accuracy and large errors. In this method, the adaptive update is introduced to deal with the uncertain noise from the lithium-ion battery. The iteration is used to improve the convergence speed and to reduce the computational burden. Compared with the EKF, iterative extended Kalman filter (IEKF) and adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF), the proposed AIEKF has a higher estimation accuracy and anti-interference capability, which is suitable for the AUV’s SOC estimation. In addition, based on the second-order equivalent circuit model of the lithium-ion battery, a forgetting factor recursive least squares (FFRLS) method is proposed to deal with the multi-variability problem. In the end, four different methods, including EKF, IEKF, AEKF, and the proposed AIEKF, are compared in computational time. The experiment results show that the proposed method has high accuracy and fast estimation speed, meaning that it has good application potential in AUVs.",

        "abstract": "In this study, a series of crosslinked membranes were prepared as solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) for all-solid-state lithium ion batteries (ASSLIBs). An epoxy-containing copolymer (glycidyl methacrylate-co-poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate, PGA) and two amine curing agents, linear Jeffamine ED2003 and hyperbranched polyethyleneimine (PEI), were utilized to prepare SPEs with various crosslinking degrees. The PGA/polyethylene oxide (PEO) blends were cured by ED2003 and PEI to obtain slightly and heavily crosslinked structures, respectively. For further optimizing the interfacial and the electrochemical properties, an interlocking bilayer membrane based on overlapping and subsequent curing of PGA/PEO/ED2003 and PEO/PEI layers was developed. The presence of this amino/epoxy network can inhibit PEO crystallinity and maintain the dimensional stability of membranes. For the slightly crosslinked PGA/PEO/ED2003 membrane, an ionic conductivity of 5.61 × 10−4 S cm−1 and a lithium ion transference number (tLi+) of 0.43 were obtained, along with a specific capacity of 156 mAh g−1 (0.05 C) acquired from an assembled half-cell battery. However, the capacity retention retained only 54% after 100 cycles (0.2 C, 80 °C), possibly because the PEO-based electrolyte was inclined to recrystallize after long term thermal treatment. On the other hand, the highly crosslinked PGA/PEO/PEI membrane exhibited a similar ionic conductivity of 3.44 × 10−4 S cm−1 and a tLi+ of 0.52. Yet, poor interfacial adhesion between the membrane and the cathode brought about a low specific capacity of 48 mAh g−1. For the reinforced interlocking bilayer membrane, an ionic conductivity of 3.24 × 10−4 S cm−1 and a tLi+ of 0.42 could be achieved. Moreover, the capacity retention reached as high as 80% after 100 cycles (0.2 C, 80 °C). This is because the presence of the epoxy-based interlocking bilayer structure can block the pathway of lithium dendrite puncture effectively. We demonstrate that the unique interlocking bilayer structure is capable of offering a new approach to fabricate a robust SPE for ASSLIBs.",

        "abstract": "Ternary transition metal oxides (TTMOs) have attracted considerable attention for rechargeable batteries because of their fascinating properties. However, the unsatisfactory electrochemical performance originating from the poor intrinsic electronic conductivity and inferior structural stability impedes their practical applications. Here, the novel hierarchical porous NiO/β-NiMoO4 heterostructure is fabricated, and exhibits high reversible capacity, superior rate capability, and excellent cycling stability in Li-ion batteries (LIBs), which is much better than the corresponding single-phase NiMoO4 and NiO materials. The significantly enhanced electrochemical properties can be attributed to its superior structural characteristics, including the large surface area, abundant pores, fast charge transfer, and catalytic effect of the intermediate product of metallic nickel. The NiO/β-NiMoO4 heterostructure delivers a high capacity of 1314 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 100 cycles. Furthermore, even after 400 cycles at 1 A g-1 , the reversible capacity remains at around 500 mA h g-1 .

The atomic-molecular level study demonstrates fully reversible electronic properties of the cathode after the first electrochemical cycle. The polyanionic oxide is not involved in chemical reactions with the fluoroethylene-containing liquid electrolyte even when charged to 5.1 V vs Li+/Li. The high stability of the cathode is explained on the basis of the developed energy level model. In contrast, the chemical composition of the cathode-electrolyte interface evolves continuously by involving MoO3 in the decomposition reaction with consequent leaching of oxide from the surface. The proposed mechanisms of chemical reactions are attributed to external electrolyte oxidation via charge transfer from the relevant electron level to the MoO3 valence band state and internal electrolyte oxidation via proton transfer to the solvents. This study provides a deeper insight into the development of both a doping strategy to enhance the electronic conductivity of high-voltage cathode materials and an efficient surface coating against unfavorable interfacial chemical reactions.",

The triazine containing polymer (CYA-ANIS) was prepared from cyanuric chloride (CYA-Cl) and o-dianisidine (ANIS) in anhydrous DMF as solvent by refluxing under the N2 gas environment. The presence of triazine and amine functional groups in the polymer results in the adsorption of CO2 up to 7 cc/g at 273 K. This inspired us to utilize the polymer for the conversion of a series of functionalised epoxides into their corresponding cyclic carbonates in the presence of tetrabutyl ammonium iodide (TBAI) as co-catalyst.The product has wide range of applications like solvent in lithium ion battery, precursor for polycarbonate, etc. The catalyst was efficient for the conversion of different mono and di-epoxides into their corresponding cyclic carbonates under atmospheric pressure in the presence of tetrabutyl ammonium iodide TBAI as co-catalyst. The study indicates that epoxide attached with electron withdrawing groups (like, CH2Cl, glycidyl ether, etc.) displayed better conversion compared to simple alkane chain attached epoxides. This catalyst mixture was capable to maintain its reactivity up to five cycles without losing its activity.

The variety of DSC results reported in literature have been perplexing the research community. Herein, the cathode-electrolyte system is chosen to reveal the changes of reaction mechanisms with different electrolyte/cathode ratios, since this system has been widely adopted to characterize thermal stability of cathodes and electrolytes in previous studies. Lithium-rich manganese-based layered oxide cathode and ester-based electrolyte are selected as representative samples. Our results reveal that flooded, sufficient, insufficient, and lean electrolyte conditions may lead to distinct thermal behaviors from probably different reaction routines, which may hold different reference values for battery-level safety analysis.

        "abstract": "The importance of lithium as a raw material is steadily increasing, especially in the growing markets of grid energy and e-mobility. Today, brines are the most important lithium sources. The rising lithium demand raises concerns over the expandability and the environmental impact of common mining techniques, which are mainly based on the evaporation of brine solutions (Salars) in arid and semiarid areas. In this case, much of the water contained in the brine is lost. Purification processes lead to further water losses of the ecosystems. This calls for new and improved processes for lithium production; one of them is electrodialysis (ED). Electrodialysis offers great potential in accessing lithium from brines in a more environmentally friendly way; furthermore, for the recovery of lithium from spent lithium-ion batteries (LIB), electrodialysis may become a vital technology. The following study focused on investigating the effect of varying brine compositions, different ED operation modes, and limiting factors on the use of ED for concentrating lithium-containing brine solutions. Synthetic lithium salt solutions (LiCl, LiOH) were concentrated using conventional ED in batch-wise operation. While the diluate solution was exchanged once a defined minimum concentration was reached, the concentrate solution was concentrated to the respective maximum. The experiments were conducted using a lab-scale ED-plant (BED1-3 from PCCell GmbH, Germany). The ion-exchange membranes used were PCSK and PCSA. The treated solutions varied in concentration and composition. Parameters such as current density, current efficiency, and energy requirements were evaluated. ED proved highly effective in the concentration of lithium salt solutions. Lithium chloride solutions were concentrated up to approximately 18-fold of the initial concentration.

        "abstract": ": It is crucial to comprehend the effect of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on battery performance to develop stable Li metal batteries. Nonetheless, the exact nanostructure and working mechanisms of the SEI remain obscure. Here, we have investigated the relationship between electrolyte components and the structural configuration of interfacial layers using an optimized cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) analysis and theoretical calculation. We revealed a unique dual-layered inorganic-rich nanostructure, in contrast to the widely known simple specific component-rich SEI layers. The origin of stable Li cycling is closely related to the Li-ion diffusion mechanism via diverse crystalline grains and numerous grain boundaries in the fine crystalline-rich SEI layer. The results can elucidate a particular issue pertaining to the chemical structure of SEI layers that can induce uniform Li diffusion and rapid Li-ion conduction on Li metal anodes, developing stable Li metal batteries.",

        "abstract": "\n When charging or discharging a lithium-ion-battery (LIB), lithiation or delithiation of the electrodes takes place. Especially in the case of anode active materials, lithiation often leads to a significant volume increase. The latter can cause a rearrangement of the particles. Although the volumetric changes of state-of-the-art cathode materials have been found to be smaller than for anodes, they remain relevant. The combined volumetric changes of anodes and cathodes are an important factor influencing the lifetime of LIBs. An electrochemical dilatometer was used to measure the thickness change of various electrode active materials under minimal constant pressure (≈ 16 kPa): graphite, silicon-graphite (SiG) composite electrodes, and high-voltage spinel lithium-nickel-manganese-oxide. The influencing factors investigated included the initial porosity of the electrodes, the particle shape of graphite, and the silicon content in the case of the silicon-graphite composite electrodes. Regarding all investigated electrodes, the initial electrode porosity is shown to correlate negatively with the irreversible thickness change during the initial cycles. The thickness change in each electrode was constant over the post-formation cycles, regardless of the initial porosity. Spherical particles in graphite resulted in slightly higher thickness changes than flake-type particles. The thickness change of SiGs increased linearly with silicon content.",

        "abstract": "Due to the higher energy density, high thermal stability, and low cost, LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) spinel, with a large voltage operating window, has been one of the most promising cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, the interfacial reaction between the cathode and electrolyte and the two-phase reaction within the bulk of LNMO would destroy the original structure and lead to capacity deterioration, posing a significant challenge. Therefore, the way to suppress the transition-metal (TM) dissolution in LNMO has attracted much attention. However, the ordered/disordered phase regulation by metal atom doping to prohibit TM dissolution has not been extensively explored. Herein, a Ge-doping strategy is proposed to adjust the ratio of disordered/ordered phases in LNMO, resulting in exceptional structural stability. For the modified spinel cathode, there is almost no voltage drop and the capacity retention is up to 92.2% over 1000 cycles at 1C. These results demonstrate that incorporating Ge into LNMO forms a robust structure that effectively increases the amount of Mn4+ while blocking the diffusion of TM ions. In addition, Ge-doping also protects the bulk from further reactions with electrolytes, significantly enhancing the interfacial stability and relieving voltage decay in cycling. This approach can also be applied to design other high-stability cathodes through ordered/disordered phase regulation.",

        "abstract": "We report the fabrication and electrochemical activity of free-standing reduced graphene oxide (RGO) films as cathode materials for lithium ion batteries. The conducting additive and binder-free RGO electrodes with different oxygen contents were assembled by a simple vacuum filtration process from aqueous RGO colloids prepared with the aid of cationic surfactants. The gravimetric capacity of RGO film cathodes showed clear dependence on the oxygen contents controlled by the thermal reduction process. The capacity increased with the increase of the amount of oxygen functional groups, indicating that the main lithium capturing mechanism of RGO cathodes is Li(+) ion interaction with the surface oxygen functionalities. The hydroxyl groups (C-OH) as well as carbon-oxygen double bonds have been identified as the lithiation-active species. The RGO cathodes achieved excellent rate capability due to the fast surface Faradaic reaction, suggesting that self-supported RGO films are promising cathodes for high power application. The graphene oxide (GO)/RGO composite films showed inferior performance to those of RGO only. The poor electronic conductivity of GO might result in inefficient utilization of redox active oxygen functional groups despite the higher oxygen content and higher theoretical capacity of GO/RGO composite films. Further optimization on the amount of oxygen functional groups for higher capacity and better electronic conductivity would lead to the development of RGO based high energy-high power cathodes.",

When evaluated as an anode for lithium-ion batteries, the Fe2 O3 @C@MoS2 /CFC electrode manifests an outstanding electrochemical performance with a high discharge capacity of 1541.2 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and a good capacity retention of 80.1% at 1.0 A g-1 after 500 cycles. As for sodium-ion batteries, it retains a high reversible capacity of 889.4 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 over 200 cycles.

Herein, deliberate interfacial modification of graphite electrodes via DC magnetron sputtering of nanoscale layers of Cu and Ni is employed to increase the overpotential for Li deposition and suppress Li plating under high rate charge conditions. Due to their nanoscale, the deposited surface films have minimal impact (~0.16% decrease) on cell level theoretical energy density. Interfacial properties of the anodes are thoroughly characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and spatially resolved mapping X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. The spectroscopic measurements indicate that the Cu and Ni coatings form oxide upon exposure to ambient environment, but they are reduced within the electrochemical cell and remain in a metallic state. Li plating is quantified by X-ray diffraction and associated electrochemistry measurements revealing that the surface treatment effectively reduces the quantity of plated Li metal by ~50% compared to untreated electrodes. These results establish an effective method using interfacial modification to achieve deliberate control of Li metal deposition overpotential and reduction of lithium plating on graphite.",

        "abstract": "Copper ions are one of the major associated metal ions present in the precursors of the synthesis of Li[NiCoMn]1/3O2 from the recovery of spent Li-ion batteries by wet chemical processes. To evaluate the feasibility of reusing Cu(2+) as a favourable dopant in Li[NiCoMn]1/3O2 instead of as usual removing it as an undesirable impurity, the effect of Cu-doping on the electrochemical behaviour of Li[NiCoMn]1/3O2 is investigated in this work. Li[NiCo1-xCuxMn]1/3O2 (x = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06 and 0.08) is synthesized through two steps, roasting the precursors obtained from carbonate co-precipitation, and their structures and electrochemical performances are systemically investigated. The results indicate that substitution of Co with Cu was successfully achieved without any detectable second phases. The initial discharge capacity of Li[NiCo1-xCuxMn]1/3O2 gradually dropped with an increase of x but the rate property and capacity retention were remarkably enhanced. In particular, the capacity retention of the Li[NiCo0.94Cu0.06Mn]1/3O2 sample reached 95.87% within 50 cycles at a current density of 160 mA g(-1). CV and EIS revealed that such improvements are ascribed to a higher Li(+) diffusion coefficient and lower charge-transfer resistance derived from Cu(2+) doping. The results suggest that Cu can be used as a beneficial dopant to partially substitute Co in synthesizing Li[NiCoMn]1/3O2 from spent LIBs instead of having to remove it as an impurity.",

Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies reveal that the nano sized 0D HAp particles are anchored on the N3DG skeletal network with an average size of less than 50 nm. EDX and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed the presence of Ca, P, O, N, and C. In addition, XPS analysis reveals the existence of N–C bonds in the prepared sample. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns indicate the presence of hexagonal phase hydroxyapatite and the calculated average crystallite size was found to be 12 nm. The developed HAp-N3DG foam based nanostructured CF was found to have a mesoporous structure and the measured specific surface area (SSA) and the mean pore diameter were found to be 64.73 m2 g−1 and 23.6 nm, respectively. Electrochemical analysis shows that HAp anchored on nitrogen-doped 3D graphene foam based nanostructured CF has moderate electrochemical activity towards lithium ion charge/discharge. In addition, the prepared material showed adsorption activity values of 204.89 mg g−1 and 243.89 mg g−1 for the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) benzene and toluene, respectively.

        "abstract": "Lithium‐metal batteries (LMB) employing cobalt‐free layered‐oxide cathodes are a sustainable path forward to achieving high energy densities, but these cathodes exhibit substantial transition‐metal dissolution during high‐voltage cycling. While transition‐metal crossover is recognized to disrupt solid‐electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation on graphite anodes, experimental evidence is necessary to demonstrate this for lithium‐metal anodes. In this work, advanced high‐resolution 3D chemical analysis is conducted with time‐of‐flight secondary‐ion mass spectrometry (TOF‐SIMS) to establish spatial correlations between the transition metals and electrolyte decomposition products found on cycled lithium‐metal anodes. Insights into the localization of various chemistries linked to crucial processes that define LMB performance, such as lithium deposition, SEI growth, and transition‐metal deposition are deduced from a precise elemental and spatial analysis of the SEI. Heterogenous transition‐metal deposition is found to perpetuate both heterogeneous SEI growth and lithium deposition on lithium‐metal anodes. These correlations are confirmed across various lithium‐metal anodes that are cycled with different cobalt‐free cathodes and electrolytes. An advanced electrolyte that is stable to higher voltages is shown to minimize transition‐metal crossover and its effects on lithium‐metal anodes. Overall, these results highlight the importance of maintaining uniform SEI coverage on lithium‐metal anodes, which is disrupted by transition‐metal crossover during operation at high voltages.",

Herein, a LiI/ZnLix mixed ion/electron conductive buffer layer is constructed at the interface by an in situ reaction of molten Li metal with ZnI2 film. This mixed buffer layer ensures close contact between the Li metal and garnet, significantly reducing interfacial impedance. As a result, the Li symmetrical cell with the LiI/ZnLix buffer layer shows an interface impedance of 10.3 Ω cm2, much lower than that of the cell with bare LLZTO (1173.4 Ω cm2).

Besides, Co doping can reduce interface charge accumulation and offset the decreasing interfacial strength during lithiation.

Free-standing and flexible Ti3C2Tx/carbon nanotube composite \"paper\" delivered ∼100 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C and ∼50 mAh g-1 at 10 C. At 1 C the capacity was maintained for >500 cycles at 80 mAh g-1. The Mo2CTx MXene also demonstrated good performance as a cathode material in this hybrid battery. Considering the variety of available MXenes, this work opens the door for exploring a new large family of 2D materials with high electrical conductivity and large intercalation capacity as cathodes for hybrid Mg2+/Li+ batteries.",

        "abstract": "Lithium thiophosphates are a promising class of solid electrolyte (SE) materials for all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) due to their high Li-ion conductivity. Yet, the practical application of lithium thiophosphates is hindered by their chemical instability, which remains a prevalent challenge in the field. Oxygen substitution has been discussed in the literature as a promising strategy to enhance stability. Nevertheless, the lack of understanding of the role of synthesis strategy on the resulting structure-property relationship makes it difficult to predict and control the material's behaviour, limiting our ability to fully utilize oxygen substitution as a viable solution. Here, we show that not only the total oxygen content but also the oxygen distribution within the material affects the ion conductivity. By carefully analysing the local structure of oxy-sulfide glasses, we find that few highly oxygenated structural units like [PO4]3- and [PO3S]3- are more detrimental to the ionic conductivity than a larger amount of less substituted units like [POS3]3-. Further, we demonstrate how the oxygen distribution is connected to the synthesis in high-energy ball milling by comparing two different sets of precursor materials. The results may explain the deviations in the past literature. The findings should be transferable to other Li-thiophosphate materials and enable more directed design of new materials.",

        "title": "Reprecipitation: A Rapid Synthesis of Micro-Sized Silicon-Graphene Composites for Long-lasting Lithium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Silicon microparticles (SiMPs) have gained significant attention as a lithium-ion battery anode material due to their 10 times higher theoretical capacity compared to conventional graphite anodes as well as their much lower production cost than silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs). However, SiMPs have suffered from poorer cycle life relative to SiNPs because their larger size makes them more susceptible to volume changes during charging and discharging. Creating a wrapping structure in which SiMPs are enveloped by carbon layers has proven to be an effective strategy to significantly improve the cycling performance of SiMPs. However, the synthesis processes are complex and time-/energy-consuming and therefore not scalable. In this study, a wrapping structure is created by using a simple, rapid, and scalable \"modified reprecipitation method\". Graphene oxide (GO) and SiMP dispersion in tetrahydrofuran is injected into n-hexane, in which GO and SiMP by themselves cannot disperse. GO and SiMP therefore aggregate and precipitate immediately after injection to form a wrapping structure. The resulting SiMP/GO film is laser scribed to reduce GO to a laser-scribed graphene (LSG). Simultaneously, SiOx and SiC protection layers form on the SiMPs through the laser process, which alleviates severe volume change. Owing to these desirable characteristics, the modified reprecipitation method successfully doubles the cycle life of SiMP/graphene composites compared to the simple physically mixing method (50.2% vs. 24.0% retention at the 100th cycle). The modified reprecipitation method opens a new synthetic strategy for SiMP/carbon composites.",

Not only should aircraft comply with this initiative but also helicopters (i.e., rotorcrafts), such as the substitution of hydraulic actuators of helicopter landing gear with electromechanical one. Even though this change is a significant step towards full electrification, the next phase would be integrating electromechanical actuators with local energy storage systems resulting in a complete zero-emission actuation. This possibility is rarely investigated in the literature. This paper analyses various electrochemical energy storage devices as an energy source for helicopter landing gear retraction/extension actuation. Lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitor and lithium-ion capacitors are selected as choices for this peculiar application. The trade-off study results show that the best option in terms of weight is storage composed of lithium-ion capacitors. In contrast, if the number of extensions and retractions is of the primary concern, the high energy lithium-ion batteries are a preferable choice.",

        "abstract": "In this study, a finite element analysis is employed to numerically investigate the thermal behavior of a battery pack comprising cylindrical lithium-ion cells. The system incorporates air cooling with phase change material (PCM) surrounding the batteries and nanofluid (NFD) circulating within the PCM through tubes of varying diameters (ranging from 2 mm to 6 mm) at flow rates (FRT) spanning 5 mL/min to 20 mL/min. A two-phase mixture model is applied to analyze the behavior of the NFD as it changes phase. The transient simulation covers a 1-h period to assess temperature variations of the NFD, batteries, surrounding air, PCM, and the phase change process within the PCM. Our results indicate that variations in NFD flow rate (NFFR) do not significantly affect the PCM’s molten fraction during PCM melting, coinciding with an increase in battery temperature (TBT). However, during the PCM refreezing phase, a FRT of 15 mL/min results in the highest quantity of solid PCM. The outlet temperature (TOT) of the NFD demonstrates a cyclical pattern of increase and decrease over time. We observe that when the NFD temperature is elevated, the lowest TOT of the NFD is associated with a FRT of 5 mL/min. Conversely, when the NFD temperature is lowered, this FRT leads to the highest TOT of the NFD. The TBT exhibits some sensitivity to changes in FRT within the initial half-hour, with a subsequent decline, particularly with a FRT of 15 mL/min.",

To determine whether a physically active patient such as an amputee can take advantage of these systems, we seek to develop an animal model of freely moving humans. Therefore, we have developed and tested HermesC, a system for recording neural activity from electrode arrays implanted in rhesus monkeys and transmitting this data wirelessly. This system is based on the integrated neural interface (INI) microchip, which amplifies, digitizes, and transmits neural data across a ~900 MHz wireless channel. The wireless transmission has a range of ~4 m in free space. All together, this device consumes 11.7 mA from a 4.0 V lithium ion battery pack for a total of 46.8 mW. To test the performance, the device was used to record and telemeter one channel of broadband neural data at 15.7 kSps from one monkey doing various physical activities in a home cage, such as eating, climbing and swinging. The in-band noise of the recorded neural signal is 34 muVrms, which is low enough to allow the detection of neural units on an active electrode. This system can be readily upgraded to use future generations of the INI chip, with circuits providing 96 channels of programmable threshold crossing event data.",

It is believed that the excellent long-term cycling performance of LNMO/NG full cells at the high voltage is a result of alleviating the devastated reaction to form the CEI and SEI on the both electrodes with electrolyte, respectively. At a voltage range from 3.4 to 4.8 V for the LNMO full cells, 95.0% capacity retention after 100 cycles is achieved when cycled with TEOS-modifying NG anode. This mechanism may be explained that eliminating the HF and absorbing water impurities in the electrolyte by introducing the TEOS group, which can transform the SiO2 species that react with the acid of HF at the organic solvent environment instead of destroying/forming the anode SEI and attacking the LNMO spinel structure to form the dense and high resistance CEI, meanwhile the SiO2 species will absorb the water molecule and precipitate into the anode surface further stabilizing the SEI configuration during the cycling.",

While catechol‐containing materials are proven successful in silicon anodes, their application in organic batteries remains unexplored. In this contribution, the synthesis of four polymers are described with nearly identical side chain composition but varying backbone structures. The materials are used to investigate the effect of polymer backbone structure on the binding abilities of catechol‐containing materials. Comparative analysis with the commonly used polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder aims to address two critical questions: 1) Can catechol‐rich polymers replace PVDF for use in organic cathodes? and 2) Does the choice of polymer backbone affect the performance of the battery?. The investigation reveals that supramolecular interactions, such as π–π stacking and coordination bonding, are pivotal features of catechol binders. Among the catechol‐rich polymers, the polyacrylate binder stands out, likely attributed to its high flexibility. Additionally, introducing an oxygen atom into a catechol‐rich polynorbornene enhances lithium‐ion conductivity and rate performance. Overall, the findings highlight the viability of catechol‐containing polymers as organic cathode binders, and that the choice of polymer backbone is a crucial factor for their use as lithium‐ion battery binder materials.",

        "abstract": "The development of facile preparation methods and novel three-dimensional structured anodes to improve cycling stability of lithium ion batteries (LIBs) is urgently needed. Herein, a dual-network ferroferric oxide/nickel oxide (Fe3O4/NiO) anode was synthesized through a facile dealloying technology, which is suitable for commercial mass manufacturing. The dual-network with high specific surface area contains a nanoplate array network and a bimodal nanoporous urchin network. It exhibits excellent electrochemical performance as an anode material for LIB, delivering a reversible capacity of 721 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 100 cycles. The good lithium storage performance is related to the ample porous structure, which can relieve stress and mitigate the volume change in the charge/discharge process, the interconnected porous network that enhances ionic mobility and permeability, and synergistic effects of two kinds of active materials. The paper provides a new idea for the design and preparation of anode materials with a novel porous structure by a dealloying method and may promote the development of the dealloying field.",

        "abstract": "Batteries can effectively improve the security of energy systems and mitigate climate change by facilitating wind and solar power. The installed capacity of battery energy storage system (BESS), mainly the lithium ion batteries are increasing significantly in recent years. However, the battery degradation cannot be accurately quantified and integrated into energy management system with existing heuristic battery degradation models. This paper proposed a hierarchical deep learning based battery degradation quantification (HDL-BDQ) model to quantify the battery degradation given scheduled BESS daily operations. Particularly, two sequential and cohesive deep neural networks are proposed to accurately estimate the degree of degradation using inputs of battery operational profiles and it can significantly outperform existing fixed or linear rate based degradation models as well as single-stage deep neural models. Training results show the high accuracy of the proposed system. Moreover, a learning and optimization decoupled algorithm is implemented to strategically take advantage of the proposed HDL-BDQ model in optimization-based look-ahead scheduling (LAS) problems. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HDL-BDQ model in LAS of a microgrid testbed.",

        "abstract": "Direct recycling of Li‐ion battery cathodes offers a sustainable and potentially cost‐effective alternative to conventional methods, often involving complex chemical processes and significant material losses. This study focuses on the relithiation of cathode materials from quality control reject (QCR) and end‐of‐life (EoL) Li‐ion cells to restore their physical structure, morphology, and electrochemical performance. Two NMC532/graphite pouch cells from the same manufacturer were studied. QCR cells, stored under ambient conditions, experienced corrosion and degradation before recycling, while EoL cells were cycled to the end of life. The cells were disassembled, and the cathode materials were delaminated using NaOH solution, then relithiated with LiOH at 700°C for 15 hours in the air. Extensive characterization analyzed elemental composition, structural properties, thermal stability, and particle size distribution. Results indicated that relithiation successfully restored lithium content and improved the structural ordering and morphology of the cathode materials. The electrochemical performance of the relithiated cathodes exhibited good stability over 100 charge‐discharge cycles. The relithiated QCR samples achieved a capacity of 155.57 mAh g⁻¹, while EoL samples reached 152.53 mAh g⁻¹, comparable to pristine materials. This study highlights relithiation's potential to extend the lifecycle of Li‐ion cathodes, contributing to a more sustainable circular economy for battery materials.",

        "abstract": "Lithium ortho-thiophosphate (Li3PS4) has emerged as a promising candidate for solid-state electrolyte batteries, thanks to its highly conductive phases, cheap components, and large electrochemical stability range. Nonetheless, the microscopic mechanisms of Li-ion transport in Li3PS4 are far from being fully understood, the role of PS4 dynamics in charge transport still being controversial. In this work, we build machine learning potentials targeting state-of-the-art DFT references (PBEsol, r2SCAN, and PBE0) to tackle this problem in all known phases of Li3PS4 (α, β, and γ), for large system sizes and time scales. We discuss the physical origin of the observed superionic behavior of Li3PS4: the activation of PS4 flipping drives a structural transition to a highly conductive phase, characterized by an increase in Li-site availability and by a drastic reduction in the activation energy of Li-ion diffusion. We also rule out any paddle-wheel effects of PS4 tetrahedra in the superionic phases—previously claimed to enhance Li-ion diffusion—due to the orders-of-magnitude difference between the rate of PS4 flips and Li-ion hops at all temperatures below melting. We finally elucidate the role of interionic dynamical correlations in charge transport, by highlighting the failure of the Nernst–Einstein approximation to estimate the electrical conductivity. Our results show a strong dependence on the target DFT reference, with PBE0 yielding the best quantitative agreement with experimental measurements not only for the electronic band gap but also for the electrical conductivity of β- and α-Li3PS4.",

        "abstract": "In lithium‐metal batteries (LMBs), the compatibility of Li anode and conventional lithium hexafluorophosphate‐(LiPF6) carbonate electrolyte is poor owing to the severe parasitic reactions. Herein, to resolve this issue, a delicately designed additive of potassium perfluoropinacolatoborate (KFPB) is unprecedentedly synthesized. On the one hand, KFPB additive can regulate the solvation structure of the carbonate electrolyte, promoting the formation of Li+FPB− and K+PF6− ion pairs with lower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels. On the other hand, FPB− anion possesses strong adsorption ability on Li anode. Thus, anions can preferentially adsorb and decompose on the Li‐anode surface to form a conductive and robust solid‐electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Only with a trace amount of KFPB additive (0.03 m) in the carbonate electrolyte, Li dendrites’ growth can be totally suppressed, and Li||Cu and Li||Li half cells exhibit excellent Li‐plating/stripping stability upon cycling. Encouragingly, KFPB‐assisted carbonate electrolyte enables high areal capacity LiCoO2||Li, LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811)||Li, and LiNi0.8Co0.05Al0.15O2 (NCA)||Li LMBs with superior cycling stability, showing its excellent universality.

Reactions of a transition metal fluoride with a phosphate source in a very low-water, high-fluoride content system and in the presence of framework charge balancing metal cations or template molecular cations, lead to materials with structures formed from linked M(O,F)(n) and P(O,F)(n) polyhedra.

The new and unusual features of these fluorophosphate materials include interlayer spaces or channels lined with fluoride ions, metal polyhedra, M(O,F)(n), linked through vertex, edge, or face-sharing, and μ(2), μ(3), and μ(4) bridging fluoride ions. Preliminary characterization of the properties of some of these metal fluorophosphates is reported, including reductive lithium ion insertion, of interest for Li-ion battery positive electrodes, ion exchange reactions, the formation of nanoporous material derivatives through template destruction, and magnetic susceptibility behaviors.",

        "abstract": "Sulfur exhibits a high theoretical capacity of 1675 mA h g-1 via a distinct conversion reaction, which is different from the insertion reactions in commercial lithium-ion batteries. In consideration of its conversion-reaction battery chemistry, a custom design for electrode materials could establish the way for attaining high-loading capability while simultaneously maintaining high electrochemical utilization and stability. In this study, this process is undertaken by introducing carbon cotton as an attractive electrode-containment material for enhancing the dynamic and static stabilities of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The carbon cotton possessing a hierarchical macro-/microporous architecture exhibits a high surface area of 805 m2 g-1 and high microporosity with a micropore area of 557 m2 g-1. The macroporous channels allow the carbon cotton to load and stabilize a high amount of active material. The abundant microporous reaction sites spread throughout the carbon cotton facilitate the redox chemistry of the high-loading/content Li-S system. As a result, the high-loading carbon-cotton cathode exhibits (i) enhanced cycle stability with a good dynamic capacity retention of 70% after 100 cycles and (ii) improved cell-storage stability with a high static capacity retention of above 93% and a low time-dependent self-discharge rate of 0.12% per day after storing for a long period of 60 days. These carbon-cotton cathodes with the remarkably highest values reported so far of both sulfur loading (61.4 mg cm-2) and sulfur content (80 wt %) demonstrate enhanced electrochemical utilization with the highest areal, volumetric, and gravimetric capacities simultaneously.",

Furthermore, at the current density of 0.5 A/g, the GeP5/AB/p-rGO composite shows the reversible capacity of 400 mAh/g after 50 cycles with a little capacity attenuation. All above results prove that the GeP5/AB/p-rGO composite has a good prospect of application as an anode material for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Si-based electrodes offer exceptionally high capacity and energy density for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), but suffer from poor structural stability and electrical conductivity that hamper their practical applications. To tackle these obstacles, we design a C/polymer bilayer coating deposited on Si-SiOx micro-particles. The inner C coating is used to improve electrical conductivity. The outer C-nanoparticle-reinforced polypyrrole (CNP-PPy) is a polymer matrix composite that can minimize the volumetric expansion of Si-SiOx and enhance its structural stability during battery operation. Electrodes made of such robust Si-SiOx@C/CNP-PPy micro-particles exhibit excellent cycling performance: 83% capacity retention (794 mAh g-1) at 2 C rate after over 900 cycles for a coin-type half cell, and 80% capacity retention (with initial energy density of 308 Wh kg-1) after over 1100 cycles for a pouch-type full cell. By comparing the samples with different coatings, an in-depth understanding of the performance enhancement is achieved, i.e., the C/CNP-PPy with crosslink bondings formed in the bilayer coating plays a key role for the improved structural stability. Moreover, a full battery using the Si-SiOx@C/CNP-PPy electrode successfully drives a car model, demonstrating a bright application prospect of the C/polymer bilayer coating strategy to make future commercial LIBs with high stability and energy density.",

        "abstract": "Carbon coated hollow alpha-Fe2O3 spheres were prepared via a facile two-step hydrothermal method. The appearance and crystalline structure of the samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The morphology showed that the hollow spheres were composed of well crystallized nanoparticles after the first hydrothermal reaction and subsequent calcinations. A thin carbon film was coated on each Fe2O3 nanoparticles after the second hydrothermal procedure. This carbon coating was probably beneficial to maintain the microstructure of the active material during repeatable lithiation and delithiation. Afterwards, the samples were assembled into half-cells to investigate the electrochemical properties. The electrode delivered relatively high initial discharge/charge capacities of 1291/890 mA h g(-1) at the rate of 0.3 C. The reversible capacity maintained very well in a prolonged 140 cycles. The capacity retention was 89% after 70 cycles, and that was 81% after 140 cycles. This exceptional lithium storage property was probably attributed to the porous and hollow structure which allowed the penetration of electrolyte to the inner of the electrode, the nanoscale Fe2O3 particles which shortened the migration pathway for lithium ion, and the carbon coating which kept the active materials structure intact. The attractive electrochemical performance suggested the carbon coated hollow Fe2O3 spheres would be the potential anode material for future lithium ion battery.",

Two solvents NMP and glycerol were applied to prepare the slurry and a favorable microstructure in the film was created after drying. The ionic conductivity of the film was tested at 1.39 mS cm−1 when paired with liquid electrolyte, almost double that of the commercial counterpart. The high ceramic loading of 70% improved both the thermal shrinkage resistance and dendrite inhibition of the membrane.

        "abstract": "The solid electrolyte interphase layer that forms on the surface of the negative electrode in Li-ion batteries is crucial for battery cycle/calendar life, rate performance and safety. This 10's of nanometers layer is formed from the decomposition of the liquid electrolyte and its passivation properties are very sensitive to its formation and aging conditions. Despite this critical role, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding of how its structure and composition relate to its stability and passivation performance.\n Amongst the SEI products that form during the decomposition of liquid electrolyte, lithium fluoride (LiF) is a ubiquitous component and many attribute its presence to be a determining factor of a well passivated interface. Despite the importance, LiF’s nanostructure and distribution within the SEI layer is rarely investigated due to the lack of suitable characterization techniques. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is the main tool to identify LiF in the SEI layer, but its micron scale lateral resolution precludes any nanometer scale mapping of LiF’s distribution which limits its ability to identify the role LiF plays in the SEI layer.\n Recently our group has been characterizing the SEI layer of Li-ion negative electrodes with nano-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (nano-FTIR).1,2 Nano-FTIR is a scanning probe technique based in a typical atomic force microscope (AFM) in which a broadband laser illuminates a metallic tip/sample interface. The metallic tip acts as an antenna, focusing the infrared light adjacent to the interface and creating a near-field interaction. By operating in constant tapping mode and due to the nonlinearity of the near-field signal on the tip/sample distance, the corresponding backscattered light from the near-field interaction with the sample can be separated from the background with lock-in amplification. The result is IR reflection and absorption spectra with lateral resolution close to the tip radius (ca. 20 nm). This far exceeds the diffraction limited resolution of typical IR microscopy (~10’s µm) creating new opportunities for IR characterization on nanometer length scales.\n In this talk, we’ll discuss our recent work related to utilizing synchrotron-based nano-FTIR to characterize and image LiF in the SEI layer of Li-ion based negative electrodes. The synchrotron infrared light source allows the detection of photons out to the far-IR (322 cm-1 limit) which enables the detection of the vibrational modes of Li containing inorganic phases such as LiF, Li2O, and LiH. By comparing model thin film LiF nano-FTIR spectra with experimental spectra take from the surfaces of Cu, Si thin film, and a novel metallic glass anode, we can gauge the heterogeneity of the LiF in the SEI layer and then suggest different LiF formation mechanisms. Based on the results, we believe that nano-FTIR with a synchrotron based light source will be a key tool to unravelling the nanoscale structure of the SEI layer due to its nanoscale chemical sensitivity and nondestructive nature.\n This research was supported by the US Department of Energy (DOE)’s Vehicle Technologies Office under the Silicon Consortium Project directed by Brian Cunningham and managed by Anthony Burrell.

        "abstract": "Micron-sized silicon oxide (SiOx) has been regarded as a promising anode material for new-generation lithium-ion batteries due to its high capacity and low cost. However, the distinct volume expansion during the repeated (de)lithiation process and poor conductivity can lead to structural collapse of the electrode and capacity fading. In this study, SiOx anode materials coated with TiO0.6N0.4 layers are fabricated by a facile solvothermal and thermal reduction technique. The TiO0.6N0.4 layers are homogeneously dispersed on SiOx particles and form an intimate contact. The TiO0.6N0.4 layers can enhance the conductivity and suppress volume expansion of the SiOx anode, which facilitate ion/electron transport and maintain the integrity of the overall electrode structure. The as-prepared SiOx-TiON-200 composites demonstrate a high reversible capacity of 854 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 with a mass loading of 2.0 mg cm-2 after 250 cycles. This surface modification technique could be extended to other anodes with low conductivity and large volume expansion for lithium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "There is a great deal of demand for rechargeable Li-ion batteries due to their high energy and power density compared to other rechargeable batteries. Despite the concern about limited lithium resources, scientists have re-examined sodium-ion batteries, since sodium is below lithium on the periodic table, and the two metals have many similar properties. As a result of its low cost, good cycle life, and reversible capacity, hard carbon (HC) is considered to be the most attractive negative electrode material for sodium-ion batteries. Nevertheless, the practical application of HC remains challenging due to its low capacity and initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). We investigated how pre-treatment conditions affected the graphitization degree in order to overcome these issues. In addition, we observed a strong correlation between pre-oxidation and electrochemical performance when the carbonization temperature was increased. The observed results will be presented during the presentation.\n \n Acknowledgments \n \n This work was funded by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan Grant (AP09259165) and by Nazarbayev University under Collaborative Research Program Grant № 20122022P1611, AK.",

MLM Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 was successfully synthesized via continuous and appropriate heat treatment. The synthesized Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 particles were coated with a Li2ZrO3 layer and doped with Zr4+ by using a Zr compound as the MLM reagent. The Li2ZrO3 coating layer could protect materials from the corrosion of hydrogen fluoride, and the structure of the base materials was stabilized due to Zr4+ doping. In addition, the formation of Li2ZrO3 captured inactive residual lithium on the surface and absorbed lithium of host materials, thereby leading to the reduction in the Li/M ratio of materials and promoting the first-cycle Coulombic efficiency. The MLM material delivered the highest initial cycle Coulombic efficiency (∼85%), the best cycle and rate performance among bare and ZrO2-coated particles.

        "abstract": "Li‐rich Mn‐based cathode materials (LRMs) are potential cathode materials for high energy density lithium‐ion batteries. However, low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) severely hinders the commercialization of LRM.

As a result, the ICE of LRM can be precisely adjusted from 84.1% to 100.7%, and a very high specific capacity of 330 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C, as well as outstanding rate capability with a fascinating specific capacity of 250 mAh g−1 at 5 C, are harvested. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduced cation/anion double defects can reduce the diffusion barrier of Li+ ions, and in situ surface reconstruction layer can induce a self‐built‐in electric field to stabilize the surface lattice oxygen. Moreover, this facile interface engineering is universal and can enhance the ICEs of other kinds of LRM effectively.

In this work, we propose an efficient strategy to improve the cyclability of upcycled Si nanomaterials through a simple battery operation protocol. When the utilization degree of Si electrodes was decreased, the electrode deformation was significantly alleviated. This directly led to an excellent electrochemical performance over 100 cycles. In addition, the average charge (delithation) voltage was shifted to a lower voltage, when the utilization degree of electrodes was controlled. These results demonstrated that our strategic approach would be an effective way to enhance the electrochemical performance of Si anodes and improve the cost-effectiveness of scaling-up the decent nanostructured Si material.",

The as-prepared interlayer delivers a high Li+ ionic conductivity (1.85 mS cm-1 ) and Li+ transference number (0.78), which not only acts as a physical barrier, but also a bidirectional catalyst for LiPSs redox process owing to the abundant heterointerfaces between the inner conductive CNTs and the outer COFs.

Two heating power levels were used to trigger thermal runaway in order to investigate the influence of heating power on thermal runaway characteristics and the mitigation effect of the PCM (phase change material). Thermal runaway processes and temperature changes were recorded. The results showed that heating results in a violent reaction of the battery, generating a high temperature and a bright flame, and the burning of PA increases the duration of a steady flame, indicating an increased threat. SA (sodium acetate trihydrate) effectively inhibited PA combustion, and the combustion time was reduced by 40.5%. PA/SA effectively retarded the rise in temperature of the battery, and the temperature rise rate was reduced by 87.3%. Increased heating power caused faster thermal runaway, and the thermal runaway mitigation effect of the CPCM was dramatically reduced. This study may provide a reference for the safe design and improvement of thermal management systems.",

        "abstract": "The low Li+ transport and poor interface have consistently been two major impediments to practical applications of Polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based composite solid-state electrolytes (PCPE). In this work, a polymerizable deep eutectic electrolyte is meticulously designed with high fluidity which consists of Poly (Ethylene Glycol) Diacrylate (PEGDA), Fluoroethylene Carbonate (FEC), Succinonitrile (SN) and dual salts (LiTFSI/LiDFOB) to promote Li+ transport and ameliorate the interface of PCPE. Inclusion of PEGDA monomers and FEC alters the crystallinity of SN, enhancing the wettability of thick electrode, and formation of polymeric 3D network from polymerization of PEGDA can anchor SN and suppress the side reactions between SN and lithium metal. Consequently, the modified PCPE exhibit an enhanced conductivity of 4.47 × 10-4 S cm-1 with Li-ion transference number of 0.60, and show an excellent lithium stability. LiCoO2(LCO)/SP-PCPE/Li batteries with higher loading (3-4.4 V, 6 mg cm-2) can work for over 300 cycles at 0.5 C. Even with an ultra-high loading of 16 mg cm-2, LCO/SP-PCPE/Li batteries achieve an excellent cycling performance. This work provides new insights into how to construct a robust interface for solid-state batteries with high-loading cathode.",

        "abstract": "The investigation of novel growth mechanisms for electrodes and the understanding of their in situ energy storage mechanisms remains major challenges in rechargeable lithium‐ion batteries. Herein, a novel mechanism for the growth of high‐purity diversified Li3VO4 nanostructures (including hollow nanospheres, uniform nanoflowers, dispersed hollow nanocubes, and ultrafine nanowires) has been developed via a microwave irradiation strategy. In situ synchrotron X‐ray diffraction and in situ transmission electron microscope observations are applied to gain deep insight into the intermediate Li3+xVO4 and Li3+yVO4 phases during the lithiation/delithiation mechanism. The first‐principle calculations show that lithium ions migrate into the nanosphere wall rapidly along the (100) plane. Furthermore, the Li3VO4 hollow nanospheres deliver an outstanding reversible capacity (299.6 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles) and excellent cycling stability (a capacity retention of 99.0% after 500 cycles) at 200 mA g−1. The unique nanostructure offers a high specific surface area and short diffusion path, leading to fast thermal/kinetic reaction behavior, and preventing undesirable volume expansion during long‐term cycling.",

        "abstract": "The main concern hindering the large-scale application of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in electric vehicles (EV) is thermal runaway (TR). In this work, three-dimensional (3D) TR and conjugate heat transfer modeling of a LIB pack consisting of 12 prismatic cells is performed. Three strategies of thermal spread protection are investigated by numerical simulation. Inserting insulation layers with different thermal conductivities between adjacent LIBs, it is observed that the time to trigger TR in cell 2 delays by 23 s, 31 s, 51 s, and 132 s. When the insulation layer material is 2 mm and 3 mm aerogel, cell 2 produces TR time of 312 s and 944 s. It has reached the standard of safety, and adjacent LIBs could not generate in TR for at least 300 s. The study also shows cell 2 causing TR at 56 s, 51 s, 48 s, and 46 s with cold plates by different mainstream velocities. To completely block the propagation of TR, this study proposes a novel hybrid protective strategy based on insulation layers and cold plates. As a result, the average temperature of cell 2 does not reach more than 80°C, LIB pack tends to be in thermal equilibrium to prevent safety accidents from occurring. The modeling approach used in this study is demonstrated to be an effective tool for the thermal protection design of power system in EV.",

        "abstract": "The electrochemical performance of Ge, an alloying anode in the form of directly grown nanowires (NWs), in Li-ion full cells (vs LiCoO2) was analyzed over a wide temperature range (−40 to 40 °C). LiCoO2||Ge cells in a standard electrolyte exhibited specific capacities 30× and 50× those of LiCoO2||C cells at −20 and −40 °C, respectively. We further show that propylene carbonate addition further improved the low-temperature performance of LiCoO2||Ge cells, achieving a specific capacity of 1091 mA h g–1 after 400 cycles when charged/discharged at −20 °C. At 40 °C, an additive mixture of ethyl methyl carbonate and lithium bis(oxalato)borate stabilized the capacity fade from 0.22 to 0.07% cycle–1. Similar electrolyte additives in LiCoO2||C cells did not allow for any gains in performance. Interestingly, the capacity retention of LiCoO2||Ge improved at low temperatures due to delayed amorphization of crystalline NWs, suppressing complete lithiation and high-order Li15Ge4 phase formation. The results show that alloying anodes in suitably configured electrolytes can deliver high performance at the extremes of temperature ranges where electric vehicles operate, conditions that are currently not viable for commercial batteries without energy-inefficient temperature regulation.",

There are vast U.S. coal reserves, much of which are in historically underrepresented or economically depressed regions. This has created environmental concerns in these regions, especially related to legacy impoundments and other waste coal issues. Finding alternative uses for that coal could create new job opportunities in these regions while also addressing climate change. Currently, there are very few applications for coal outside of its traditional use for electricity production.\n This group has been developing alternative uses for coal, including uses in energy storage applications. This presentation will discuss the development of macroporous coal materials that then can be further processed into micron or nanometer size particles for porous materials. The characterization of these porous materials will be presented. Graphitized materials for use in lithium ion battery electrodes will be presented. Nanoscale materials such as graphene and carbon quantum dots derived from coal will be presented, along with their application in porous electrodes for batteries and capacitors.",

        "abstract": "NiO nanowire-in-nanotube structured nanofibers were easily and directly fabricated via one-pot uniaxial electrospinning followed by calcination process for the first time. Firstly, Ni(CH3COO)2/PVP composite nanofibers were prepared by a conventional electrospinning method, and then NiO nanowire-in-nanotube structured nanofibers were successfully synthesized by two-stage calcination procedure of Ni(CH3COO)2/PVP composite nanofibers which was determined to be the key process for preparing NiO nanowire-in-nanotube structured nanofibers. The NiO nanowire-in-nanotube structured nanofibers have pure cubic phase structure with space group of Fm3̄m, and the outer diameter and wall thickness of nanotubes and nanowire diameter are 130 ± 0.99 nm, 30 nm and 40 nm, respectively. Preliminarily, it is satisfactorily found that NiO nanowire-in-nanotube structured nanofibers used as photocatalyst for water splitting exhibit higher H2 evolution rate of 622 μmol h−1 than counterpart NiO hollow nanofibers of 472 μmol h−1 owing to its novel nanostructure. The possible formation mechanism of NiO nanowire-in-nanotube structured nanofibers is proposed. To evaluate the universality of this novel preparative technique, taking Co3O4 as an example, it is found that Co3O4 nanowire-in-nanotube structured nanofibers are also successfully fabricated via this novel method. The special nanowire-in-nanotube structure of the one-dimensional nanomaterials makes them have promising applications in catalysis, lithium-ion battery, drug delivery, etc. This manufacturing strategy has some advantages over other methods to form nanowire-in-nanotube structured nanofibers, such as easy, highly efficient and cost effective. The design idea and synthetic technique provide a novel perspective to create other nanowire-in-nanotube structured nanomaterials.",

Structure and morphology characterization were conducted for all prepared samples. The crystalline results indicate that both LCO and LCNO possess a rhombohedral structure, while the morphology results show irregular shapes. Electrochemical tests were carried out for LiCoO2 and LiCo0.25 Ni0.75O2 samples only. From the electrochemical measurements, the LiCo0.25 Ni0.75O2 demonstrate higher charge and discharge capacities compared to the LiCoO2 electrode, findings which are consistent with the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results of both the prepared Lithium Cobalt Oxide (LCO) and Lithium Cobalt Nickel Oxide (LCNO) samples reveal characteristic peaks at specific angles (2θ) indicating crystallographic planes. For LCO, peaks were observed at 18.96°, 37.40°, 38.35°, 39.07°, 45.29°, 49.45°, and 59.62° corresponding to crystallographic planes (003), (101), (006), (012), (104), (015), and (107) respectively. These peaks confirm the formation of a rhombohedral LiCoO2 nanostructure with space group (R-3m no.166), consistent with standard data (JCPDS 00-016-0427). The EDX spectra of the synthesized Lithium Cobalt Oxide (LCO) and Lithium Cobalt Nickel Oxide (LCNO) were analyzed. The results showed the presence of oxygen (O), cobalt (Co), and nickel (Ni) elements. However, the peak corresponding to lithium (Li) was not visible due to its low activation energy. Finally, the synthesis and characterization of LiCoO2 (LCO) and LiCo1-xNixO2 (LCNO) compounds were conducted, with electrochemical tests indicating superior performance of LiCo0.25 Ni0.75O2 over LiCoO2",

Importantly, this interfacial layer is proved to be sufficient in damping polysulfide anion diffusion and stopping irreversible reduction between polysulfides and metallic Li, which greatly contribute to the performance improvement of Li-S batteries. The resulting Li-S batteries exhibit long-term stability with high capacity retention and Coulombic efficiency. This effective strategy sets a new approach for regulating the interfacial chemistry of Li metal anodes, which is significant for highly stable Li-S batteries.",

The LP coating layer with abundant electronegative phosphate group as permselective ion sieve not only reduces the polysulfide shuttle but also facilitates uniform Li+ flux through the PP separator. And the highly conductive CNTs on the second layer act as a second collector to accelerate the reversible conversion of sulfide species. The synergistic effect of LP and CNTs further increases the electrolyte wettability and reaction kinetics of cells with a modified separator and suppresses the shuttle effect and growth of Li dendrite. Consequently, the LSBs present much enhanced rate performance and cyclic performance.

A high initial discharge capacity (311 mA h g(-1)) and initial Coulombic efficiency (81.7%) were obtained for ATNs, and capacities of 252, 202, 186, 158, 136, and 119 mA h g(-1) were obtained at 0.2, 1, 5, 10, 20, and 30 C, respectively. Particularly, the ATNs can still maintains a capacity of 108 mA h g(-1) after 4000 cycles at 30 C (only a capacity loss of 10%), which indicated a superior rate capabilities and cyclability. The CVs analysis revealed that the ANTs have both diffusive lithium storage in the bulk and pseudocapacitive lithium storage at the surface (also called interfacial lithium storage), and the pseudocapacitive lithium storage dominates the total capacity when the scan rates are above 1 mV s(-1). The fast and stable lithium storage of ATNs might be attributed to the high pseudocapacitive lithium storage contribution in the material, and it was suggested the pseudocapacitive lithium storage could occurred at grain-grain interfaces as well as nanosheet surfaces.",

        "abstract": "When designing the battery of an electric vehicle, different parameters must be considered to obtain the safest arrangement of the battery/modules/cells from the mechanical and thermal points of view. In this study, the thermal runaway propagation mechanism of lithium-ion cells is analyzed as a function of their arrangement within a battery pack in case of a fire propagation of a battery pack in which a thermal runaway has occurred. The objective is to identify which cell/module arrangement is most critical within the battery pack, using microscopic analysis of the structure and chemical composition of the most damaged cells, both horizontally and vertically, of a battery belonging to a burnt vehicle. And their final condition was compared with the condition of new cells of the same type. In this way, the structure and chemical composition of the cathode, anode, and separator after thermal runaway were compared. This research was carried out to obtain information to understand the mechanical properties of lithium-ion cells and their behavior after thermal runaway heating leading to the propagation of a fire. Through the analysis carried out, it is concluded that cells placed in a vertical arrangement have worse behavior than cells in a horizontal arrangement. Regarding the safety of the battery, the results of this study will allow us to determine which arrangement and structure of the cells in the battery pack is safer against thermal runaway due to thermal failure.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Recently emerging lithium ternary chlorides have attracted increasing attention for solid‐state electrolytes (SSEs) due to their favorable combination between ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. However, a noticeable discrepancy in Li‐ion conductivity persists between chloride SSEs and organic liquid electrolytes, underscoring the need for designing novel chloride SSEs with enhanced Li‐ion conductivity. Herein, an intriguing trigonal structure (i.e., Li3SmCl6 with space group P3112) is identified using the global structure searching method in conjunction with first‐principles calculations, and its potential for SSEs is systematically evaluated. Importantly, the structure of Li3SmCl6 exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 15.46 mS cm−1 at room temperature due to the 3D lithium percolation framework distinct from previous proposals, associated with the unique in‐plane cation ordering and stacking sequences. Furthermore, it is unveiled that Li3SmCl6 possesses a wide electrochemical window of 0.73−4.30 V vs Li+/Li and excellent chemical interface stability with high‐voltage cathodes. Several other Li3MCl6 (M = Er, and In) materials with isomorphic structures to Li3SmCl6 are also found to be potential chloride SSEs, suggesting the broader applicability of this structure. This work reveals a new class of ternary chloride SSEs and sheds light on strategy for structure searching in the design of high‐performance SSEs.",

        "title": "Recovery of Ni-Co-Mn Oxides from End-of-Life Lithium-Ion Batteries for the Application of a Negative Temperature Coefficient Sensor",
        "abstract": "This study demonstrates the current advancements in battery management systems (BMSs), emphasizing the need for precise temperature monitoring within battery packs to enhance safety and performance through efficient thermal management. The increased demand for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has driven the development of temperature sensors with improved accuracy and stability. In particular, Ni-Co-Mn-based spinel oxides are commonly used due to their stable negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behavior. However, challenges arise in manufacturing due to the high cost and uncertain supply of critical cathode components (e.g., Co, Ni, and Mn) for LIBs. This research focuses on developing spinel-type (Ni0.6Co0.4Mn2)O4 using recycled Ni-Co-Mn oxides obtained from end-of-life (EOL) LIBs, demonstrating temperature resistance behavior suitable for temperature sensing. The oxides are prepared through hydrometallurgy, oxalate synthesis, and post-heat treatment. Successful integration into spinel-type NTC thermistors suggests broader applications in various industrial fields. A systematic investigation into the synthesis and characterization of recovered Ni-Co-Mn oxides from EOL LIB cathode materials (Li(Ni0.33Co0.33Mn0.33)O2) is presented for NTC thermistor application. Thermogravimetric analysis-derivative thermogravimetry (TGA-DTG) identifies the optimal post-heat treatment temperature. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirm a cubic spinel structure of the Ni-Co-Mn oxides, supported by scanning electron microscope (SEM) images showing a uniform microstructure. Also, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping confirms homogeneous element distribution. Recovered oxide pellets from the sintering process exhibit a single spinel structure, with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis revealing changes in the valence states for Ni and Mn. Resistivity measurements demonstrate semiconductive behavior, which shows a B value (3376.92 K) suitable for NTC thermistor applications. This study contributes valuable insights to black powder recycling from EOL LIBs and its potential in temperature-sensitive electronic devices.",

        "abstract": "Cathode coatings have received extensive attention due to their ability to delay electrochemical performance degradation in lithium-ion batteries. However, the development of cathode coatings possessing high ionic conductivity and good interfacial stability with cathode materials has proven to be a challenge. Here, we performed first-principles computational studies on the phase stability, thermodynamic stability, and ionic transport properties of LiMXO4F (M-X = Al-P and Mg-S) used as cathode coatings. We find that the candidate coatings are thermodynamically metastable and can be synthesized experimentally. The coating materials possess high oxidative stability, with the materials predicted to decompose above 4.2 V, suggesting that they have good electrochemical stability under a high-voltage cathode. In addition, the candidate coatings exhibit significant chemical stability when in contact with oxide cathodes. Finally, we have studied the Li-ion transport paths and migration barriers of LiMXO4F (M-X = Al-P and Mg-S) and calculated the low migration barriers to be 0.19 and 0.09 eV, respectively. Our findings indicate that LiMXO4F (M-X = Al-P and Mg-S) are promising cathode coatings, among which LiAlPO4F has been experimentally confirmed. The theoretical cathode coating computational methods presented here can be extended to the solid-state battery system.",

        "abstract": "A common challenge in the implementation of Internet of Things (IOT) Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is that the sensor nodes are known to be power hungry devices. The energy stored in the batteries which power up these sensor nodes deplete quickly especially when more data is transmitted to the cloud or when multiple sensors are attached to a single sensor node. In the context of flood and environmental monitoring, increasing the number of sensor nodes in a Wireless Sensor Network is desirable in order to increase the spatial resolution of the data and hence achieve better representation about rising water levels and overall water quality in a particular city. However, having more sensor nodes in a Wireless Sensor Network results in more challenges for the power supply management of the overall Wireless Sensor Network. A drawback of the sensor nodes which are usually powered by Lithium Ion batteries is that there is a limited number of cycles in which a battery can be charged and discharged before the battery is considered to be fully degraded and therefore methods which can lengthen the duration of each charging and discharging cycle will be useful to increase the overall battery longevity. In this paper, a method which combines solar energy harvesting together with a fuzzy logic based algorithm for adaptive sampling is proposed in order to achieve a continuous source of energy for the sensor nodes and also increase the duration between each charging and discharging cycle resulting in batteries which can last for a longer duration. The developed sensor nodes have been deployed to measure river water levels and dissolved oxygen.",

Germanium, possessing a high theoretical capacity, is a promising anode material for lithium ion batteries, but still faces poor cyclability due to huge volume changes during the lithium alloying/dealloying process. Herein, we synthesized an amorphous germanium and zinc chalcogenide (GZC) with a hierarchically porous structure via a solvothermal reaction. As an anode material in a lithium ion battery, the GZC electrode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 747 mA h g−1 after 350 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1 and a stable capacity of 370 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at a current density of 1000 mA g−1 along with 92% capacity retention. All of these outstanding electrochemical properties are attributed to the hierarchically porous structure of the electrode that has a large surface area, fast ion conductivity and superior structural stability, which buffers the volumetric variation during charge/discharge processes and also makes it easier for the electrolyte to soak in, affording more electrochemically active sites.",

Our proposed method integrates the accelerated-KAZE algorithm with the boosted efficient binary local image descriptor (BEBLID), and is named A-BEBLID. Facing the challenge of the inevitable offset caused by machine vibration during production, we combine a nonlinear diffusion filter with a local image descriptor to extract features from images, and then use the grid-based motion statistics algorithm to remove the incorrect matching pairs. We tested the method on a custom dataset created using images taken from actual lithium-ion battery production lines, named LBCSP. We also evaluated the method on the public HPatches dataset. The average precision achieved by A-BEBLID on the LBCSP dataset is 89% (threshold: 2 pixels), with a localization error of 1.11 pixels, while on the HPatches dataset, the average precision is 73% (threshold: 2 pixels), with a localization error of 1.52 pixels. Comprehensive experimental results also showed that the proposed A-BEBLID can outperform other approaches found in the literature.

        "title": "Rechargeable nickel–3D zinc batteries: An energy-dense, safer alternative to lithium-ion",
        "abstract": "Zinc can compete with lithium Although lithium-based batteries are ubiquitous, there are still challenges related to their longevity and safety, as well as concerns about material availability. Aqueous rechargeable batteries based on zinc might provide an alternative, but they have been plagued by the formation of dendrites during cycling. Parker et al. show that when zinc is formed into three-dimensional sponges, it can be used with nickel to form primary batteries that allow for deep discharge. Alternatively, the sponges can be used to produce secondary batteries that can be cycled thousands of times and can compete with lithium ion cells. Science, this issue p. 415 A nickel–zinc battery may provide a much safer option to lithium-based cells with comparable performance. The next generation of high-performance batteries should include alternative chemistries that are inherently safer to operate than nonaqueous lithium-based batteries. Aqueous zinc-based batteries can answer that challenge because monolithic zinc sponge anodes can be cycled in nickel–zinc alkaline cells hundreds to thousands of times without undergoing passivation or macroscale dendrite formation. We demonstrate that the three-dimensional (3D) zinc form-factor elevates the performance of nickel–zinc alkaline cells in three fields of use: (i) >90% theoretical depth of discharge (DODZn) in primary (single-use) cells, (ii) >100 high-rate cycles at 40% DODZn at lithium-ion–commensurate specific energy, and (iii) the tens of thousands of power-demanding duty cycles required for start-stop microhybrid vehicles.",

        "title": "Integrated Circular Economy Model System for Direct Lithium Extraction: From Minerals to Batteries Utilizing Aluminum Hydroxide.",
        "abstract": "Aluminum hydroxide, an abundant mineral found in nature, exists in four polymorphs: gibbsite, bayerite, nordstrandite, and doyleite. Among these polymorphs gibbsite, bayerite, and commercially synthesized amorphous aluminum hydroxide have been investigated as sorbent materials for lithium extraction from sulfate solutions. The amorphous form of Al(OH)3 exhibits a reactivity higher than that of the naturally occurring crystalline polymorphs in terms of extracting Li+ ions. This study employed high-temperature oxide melt solution calorimetry to explore the energetics of the sorbent polymorphs. The enthalpic stability order was measured to be gibbsite > bayerite > amorphous Al(OH)3. The least stable form, amorphous Al(OH)3, undergoes a spontaneous reaction with lithium, resulting in the formation of a stable layered double hydroxide phase. Consequently, amorphous Al(OH)3 shows promise as a sorbent material for selectively extracting lithium from clay mineral leachate solutions. This research demonstrates the selective direct extraction of Li+ ions using amorphous aluminum hydroxide through a liquid-solid lithiation reaction, followed by acid-free delithiation and relithiation processes, achieving an extraction efficiency of 86%, and the maximum capacity was 37.86 mg·g-1 in a single step during lithiation. With high selectivity during lithiation and nearly complete recoverability of the sorbent material during delithiation, this method presents a circular economy model. Furthermore, a life cycle analysis was conducted to illustrate the environmental advantages of replacing the conventional soda ash-based precipitation process with this method, along with a simple operational cost analysis to evaluate reagent and fuel expenses.",

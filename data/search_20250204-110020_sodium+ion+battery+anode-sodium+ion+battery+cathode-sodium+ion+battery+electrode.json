        "abstract": "Rechargeable solid-state Na metal batteries (SSNMB) can offer high operational safety and energy density. However, poor solid-solid contact between the electrodes and the electrolyte can dramatically increase interfacial resistance and Na dendrite formation, even at low current rates. Therefore, we developed a carbon-fiber-supported liquid Na-K alloy anode that ensures close anode-electrolyte contact, enabling superior cycle stability and rate capability. We then demonstrated the first cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) characterization of an SSNMB, capturing the evolution of solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) and revealing both crystalline and amorphous phases, which could facilitate ion transport and prevent continuous side reactions. By enhancing contact between the Na-K alloy and solid-state electrolyte, these symmetric cells are capable of cycling for over 800 h without notable increased polarization and enable an unprecedented critical current density (CCD) at 40 mA cm-2. Our liquid Na-K alloy approach offers a promising strategic avenue toward commercial SSNMBs.",

        "abstract": "While lithium resources are scarce for high energy‐dense lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), serving as an alternative, inherently suffer from low capacity and the high‐cost use of non‐graphite anodes. Combining Li‐ and Na‐ions within a single battery system is expected to mitigate the shortcomings of both systems while leveraging their respective advantages. In this study, we developed and assembled a nanodiamonds (NDs)‐assisted co‐Li/Na‐ion battery (ND–LSIB). This innovative battery system comprised a commercial graphite anode, an ND‐modified polypropylene (DPP) separator, a hybrid lithium/sodium‐based electrolyte, and a cathode. It is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that the ND/Li co‐insertion can serve as an ion‐drill opening graphite layers and reconstructing graphite anodes into few‐layered graphene with expanding interlayer space, achieving highly efficient Li/Na storage and the theoretical maximum of LiC6 for Li storage in graphite. In addition, ND is helpful for creating a LiF‐/NaF‐rich hybrid solid electrolyte interface with improved ionic mobility, mechanical strength, and reversibility. Consequently, ND–LSIBs have higher specific capacities ~1.4 times the theoretical value of LIBs and show long‐term cycling stability. This study proposes and realizes the concept of Li/Na co‐storage in one ion battery with compatible high‐performance, cost‐effectiveness, and industrial prospects.",

        "abstract": "Rational construction of nanosized anode nanomaterials is crucial to enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium-/sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs). Various anode nanoparticles are created mainly via templating surface confinement, or encapsulation within precursors (such as metal-organic frameworks). Herein, low-content SnO2 nanodots on N-doped reduced graphene oxide (SnO2@N-rGO) were prepared as anode nanomaterials for LIBs and SIBs, via a distinctive lattice confinement of a CoAlSn-layered double hydroxide (CoAlSn-LDH) precursor. The SnO2@N-rGO composite exhibits the advantagous features of low-content (17.9 wt%) and uniform SnO2 nanodots (3.0 ± 0.5 nm) resulting from the lattice confinement of the Co and Al species to the surrounded Sn within the same crystalline layer, and high-content conductive rGO. The SnO2@N-rGO composite delivers a highly reversible capacity of 1146.2 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 for LIBs, and 387 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 for SIBs, outperforming N-rGO. Furthermore, the dominant capacitive contribution and the rapid electronic and ionic transfer, as well as small volume variation, all give rise to the enhancement. Precursor-based lattice confinement could thus be an effective strategy for designing and preparing uniform nanodots as anode nanomaterials for electrochemical energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Metallic selenides have been widely investigated as promising electrode materials for metal-ion batteries based on their relatively high theoretical capacity. However, rapid capacity decay and structural collapse resulting from the larger-sized Na+ /K+ greatly hamper their application. Herein, a bimetallic selenide (MoSe2 /CoSe2 ) encapsulated in nitrogen, sulfur-codoped hollow carbon nanospheres interconnected reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (rGO@MCSe) are successfully designed as advanced anode materials for Na/K-ion batteries. As expected, the significant pseudocapacitive charge storage behavior substantially contributes to superior rate capability. Specifically, it achieves a high reversible specific capacity of 311 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 in NIBs and 310 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 in KIBs. A combination of ex situ X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy tests reveals the phase transition of rGO@MCSe in NIBs/KIBs. Unexpectedly, they show quite different Na+ /K+ insertion/extraction reaction mechanisms for both cells, maybe due to more sluggish K+ diffusion kinetics than that of Na+ . More significantly, it shows excellent energy storage properties in Na/K-ion full cells when coupled with Na3 V2 (PO4 )2 O2 F and PTCDA@450 °C cathodes. This work offers an advanced electrode construction guidance for the development of high-performance energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "Development of the next-generation, high-energy-density, low-cost batteries will likely be fueled by sodium (Na) metal batteries because of their high capacity and the abundance of Na. However, their practical application is significantly plagued by the hyper-reactivity of Na metal, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and dendritic Na growth, leading to continuous electrolyte decomposition, low Coulombic efficiency, large impedance, and safety concerns. Herein, we add a small amount of SnCl2 additive in a common carbonate electrolyte so that the spontaneous reaction between SnCl2 and Na metal enables in situ formation of a Na-Sn alloy layer and a compact NaCl-rich SEI. Benefitting from this design, rapid interfacial ion transfer is realized and direct exposure of Na metal to the electrolyte is prohibited, which jointly achieve a nondendritic deposition morphology and a markedly reduced voltage hysteresis in a Na/Na symmetric cell for over 500 h. The Na/SnCl2-added electrolyte/Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell exhibits high capacity retention over cycling and excellent rate capability (101 mAh/g at 10 C).

Herein, mesoporous, conductive, thin-wall three-dimension (3D) skeletons of molybdenum nitride (meso-Mo2N) were established and employed as anodes to facilitate rate performance for SIBs. Mesoporous channels (～9.3 nm) with very thin walls (＜8 nm) and conductive networks in meso-Mo2N enable the rapid Na+/Li+ infiltrability/diffusivity and smooth electron transfer, respectively. The fast ion diffusion/transfer ability is confirmed by galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, cyclic voltammetry tests with higher ion-diffusion dominated capacity and larger Na+ diffusion coefficient. Consequently, meso-Mo2N exhibited a superior rate capability and a stable specific capacity of 158 mAh g-1 (after 1000 cycles) at 1 A g-1 for SIBs, surpassing nonporous Mo2N and even the previously reported Mo2N. Furthermore, the proof of concept can be also extended to enhanced Li storage.

        "abstract": "We systematically investigated the potential of single-layer VS2 polytypes as Na-battery anode materials via density functional theory calculations. We found that sodiation tends to inhibit the 1H-to-1T structural phase transition, in contrast to lithiation-induced transition on monolayer MoS2. Thus, VS2 can have better structural stability in the cycles of charging and discharging. Diffussion of Na atom was found to be very fast on both polytypes, with very small diffusion barriers of 0.085 eV (1H) and 0.088 eV (1T). Ab initio random structure searching was performed in order to explore stable configurations of Na on VS2. Our search found that both the V top and the hexagonal center sites are preferred adsorption sites for Na, with the 1H phase showing a relatively stronger binding. Notably, our random structures search revealed that Na clusters can form as a stacked second layer at full Na concentration, which is not reported in earlier works wherein uniform, single-layer Na adsorption phases were assumed. With reasonably high specific energy capacity (232.91 and 116.45 mAh/g for 1H and 1T phases, respectively) and open-circuit voltage (1.30 and 1.42 V for 1H and 1T phases, respectively), VS2 is a promising alternative material for Na-ion battery anodes with great structural sturdiness. Finally, we have shown the capability of the ab initio random structure searching in the assessment of potential materials for energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "Carbon materials are widely used for reversible lithium uptake in the anode of lithium-ion batteries. Nevertheless, the challenge of uncontrollable dendrite deposition during fast charge-discharge cycles remains a grand hurdle. Various strategies have been explored to prevent detrimental heterogeneous dendrite metal deposits, such as interface engineering and electrolyte modification, but they often compromise the reverse diffusion freedom of Li+ ions during discharging and are incompatible with the most mainstream use of graphite as an anode material. Here, we propose the incorporation of a novel carbon allotrope of cyclocarbon as a potential additive in the anode. In contrast to conventional carbon materials, density functional theory calculations reveal that cyclocarbon has a much higher affinity for Li atoms than Li+ ions, even surpassing the inherent cohesion of Li atoms, due to the charge transfer from the 2s orbital of Li atoms to the unique in-plane π orbital of cyclocarbon. Furthermore, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that Li+ ions can shuttle freely back and forth across cyclocarbon, whereas the lithiation process for Li atoms occurs rapidly within picoseconds. The delithiation of Li atoms within cyclocarbon follows a voltage-gated mechanism that is effectively controlled by an external electric field of 3 V nm-1. Remarkably, cyclocarbon exhibits potential compatibility with commercialized graphite electrodes via the π-π interaction and also can be extended to sodium-ion and potassium-ion batteries. These distinct compatibility, scalability and electrochemical properties of cyclocarbon provide a new avenue to realize both safety and ultrafast rechargeable performance of ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Aqueous sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are gradually being recognized as viable solutions for large-scale energy storage because of their inherent safety as well as low cost. However, despite recent advancements in water-in-salt electrolyte technologies, the challenge of identifying anode materials with sufficient specific capacity persists, complicating the wider adoption of these batteries. This study introduces an innovative and straightforward approach for synthesizing vanadium oxide laser-scribed graphene (VOx-LSG) composites, which function as effective anode materials in aqueous sodium-ion batteries. By combining a rapid laser-scribing technique with precise thermal control, the method not only allows for changing the morphology of the vanadium oxide, but also tuning its oxidation state. This is achieved while embedding these electrochemically active particles within a highly conductive graphene scaffold. When paired with a Prussian blue-based cathode (Na1.88Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.97) in a concentrated NaClO4-based aqueous electrolyte, the battery's charge storage mechanism is found to be largely surface-controlled, leading to exceptional rate performance. The full cell demonstrates specific capacities of 128 mA h/g@0.05 A/g and 65.6 mA h/g@1 A/g, with an energy density of 47.7 W h/kg, outperforming many existing aqueous sodium-ion batteries.

Herein, self‐supporting nitrogen‐doped and carbon‐coated 1T/2H mixed‐phase MoS2 nanosheets with rich sulfur vacancies on carbon cloth (C@N‐MoS2‐p/CC) are synthesized through a hydrothermal method and Ar/NH3 radio‐frequency (RF) plasma treatment process. Density‐functional‐theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that after Ar/NH3 RF plasma treatment, nitrogen‐doping and etching effects are realized, which combine with carbon‐coating significantly reduce the phase transition energy of 1T‐MoS2, thus triggering the phase transition and enabling the stable existence of the highly active 1T‐MoS2.

        "abstract": "The binder's choice holds immense significance in the quest for robust electrochemical performances of lithium/sodium‐ion battery's (LIB/SIB) electrodes. Conventional PVDF binder is a passive polymer lacking the ability to transport Li+/Na+ and facilitate ion kinetics. This limitation poses constraints in achieving high specific capacity, fast charging, and long cycle life. Herein, a novel water‐soluble concentrated imidazolium functionalized poly(ionic liquid), poly(oxycarbonylmethylene 1‐allyl‐3‐methyimidazolium) (PMAI) is synthesized, and evaluated it as binder in LIB/SIB. PMAI‐based anodic‐half cell exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, achieving higher capacities (297 mAhg−1 at 1C for LIBs and 250 mAhg−1 at 60 mAg−1 for SIBs) and good cycle stability (80 % capacity retention after 750 cycles for LIBs; 96% capacity retention after 200 cycles for SIBs), compared to PVDF binder. In addition, PMAI/Gr delivers a higher discharge capacity of 85 mAhg−1 than PVDF/Gr with 47 mAhg−1 at 5C. PMAI‐containing electrodes show better rate capability at different current densities than PVDF binder in LIB/SIB. The enhanced ion diffusion coefficient, lower resistance and decreased activation energy of desolvation, are ascribed to densely polar ionic liquid groups along the polymer and formation of a functionalized SEI via binder reduction. The novel PMAI binder's design and full‐cell examination confirm its potential in secondary‐ion battery applications.",

        "abstract": "Superior high‐rate performance and ultralong cycling life have been constantly pursued for rechargeable sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). In this work, a facile strategy is employed to successfully synthesize porous CoxP hierarchical nanostructures supported on a flexible carbon fiber cloth (CoxP@CFC), constructing a robust architecture of ordered nanoarrays. Via such a unique design, porous and bare structures can thoroughly expose the electroactive surfaces to the electrolyte, which is favorable for ultrafast sodium‐ion storage. In addition, the CFC provides an interconnected 3D conductive network to ensure firm electrical connection of the electrode materials. Besides the inherent flexibility of the CFC, the integration of the hierarchical structures of CoxP with the CFC, as well as the strong synergistic effect between them, effectively help to buffer the mechanical stress caused by repeated sodiation/desodiation, thereby guaranteeing the structural integrity of the overall electrode. Consequently, CoxP@CFC as an anode shows a record‐high capacity of 279 mAh g−1 at 5.0 A g−1 with almost no capacity attenuation after 9000 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Featuring a high theoretical capacity, low cost, and abundant resources, sodium metal has emerged as an ideal anode material for sodium ion batteries. However, the real feasibility of sodium metal anodes is still hampered by the uncontrolled sodium dendrite problems. Herein, an artificial three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical porous sodiophilic V2CTx/rGO-CNT microgrid aerogel is fabricated by a direct-ink writing 3D printing technology and further adopted as the matrix of Na metal to deliver a Na@V2CTx/rGO-CNT sodium metal anode. Upon cycling, the V2CTx/rGO-CNT electrode can yield a superior cycling life of more than 3000 h (2 mA cm-2, 10 mAh cm-2) with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.54%. More attractively, it can even sustain a stable operation over 900 h at 5 mA cm-2 with an ultrahigh areal capacity of 50 mAh cm-2. In situ and ex situ characterizations and density functional theory simulation analyses prove that V2CTx with abundant sodiophilic functional groups can effectively guide the sodium metal nucleation and uniform deposition, thus enabling a dendrite-free morphology. Moreover, a full cell pairing a Na@V2CTx/rGO-CNT anode with a Na3V2(PO4)3@C-rGO cathode can deliver a high reversible capacity of 86.27 mAh g-1 after 400 cycles at 100 mA g-1. This work not only clarifies the superior Na deposition chemistry on the sodiophilic V2CTx/rGO-CNT microgrid aerogel electrode but also offers an approach for fabricating advanced Na metal anodes via a 3D printing method.",

        "abstract": "The shortage of high-capacity anode materials with long cycling stability is the main roadblock to the development of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The advantages of transition metal selenides are high theoretical capacity, safety and ease of design, which gradually make them potential substitute materials for the anodes of a new generation of SIBs. However, the low intrinsic conductivity of transition metal selenides and the serious powderization during charge and discharge processes restrict their rate performance and cycling stability in SIBs. Herein, bimetallic selenide ZnSe/MoSe2@NC is fabricated by in situ selenation of a rhombic dodecahedron structured metal-organic framework (MOF) containing Zn/Mo salt. Such a heterojunction and structural regulation effectively promote sodium ion transportation. Furthermore, the porous and hierarchical ZnSe/MoSe2@NC is capable of adapting to the volume stress generated by sodium ion (de)insertion. Specifically, in SIB half-cell measurement, a comparable capacity of 401.8 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 1 A g-1 can be achieved by ZnSe/MoSe2@NC. Additionally, the ZnSe/MoSe2@NC polyhedron delivers a high capacity of 345.7 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1 (1500 cycles). Electrochemical kinetics analysis is performed in detail. In SIB full battery applications, the cell shows an impressive energy density of 175.1 W h kg-1. This research broadens the development prospect of transition metal selenides as anodes in SIBs.",

        "title": "Investigation of Sodium Leaching into Electrolytes during Electrochemical Testing",
        "abstract": "Many mechanisms and degradation pathways have been identified in the literature that result in leaching of transition metals from the cathode, resulting in loss of capacity during cycle life testing due to fewer sites for lithium intercalation into the cathode during discharge1. But electrode formulations contain more components than just active material- there are also binders, conductive carbon, other additives, and coatings. The extent to which these other components can break down and cause electrode degradation and any subsequent effects on cell performance is not well known.\n This poster explores the chemical and electrochemical influences on extraction of materials from electrodes, such as sodium, that may be harmful to battery performance. Post mortem analyses of electrolytes after electrochemical testing in multilayer pouch cells have found sodium content in the range of 200-300 ppm, well above typical specifications for battery-grade products (1-10 ppm). The most probable source of sodium in the battery is sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), often used in graphite anodes as a rheology modifier during production. In this study, the leachability of sodium from CMC in various extraction solutions was investigated through model systems. Model system experiments have shown that while the sodium in CMC was insoluble in organic solvents and electrolyte, sodium can be extracted by contact between salt-containing electrolytes and CMC-containing anodes. The amount of sodium recovered in the model system closely corresponds with the amount that was recovered from cells after electrochemical operation. Other anode and cell components were also analyzed as potential sources of sodium, and the prospect of each of these as a source of sodium was explored. Finally, the effect of different levels of sodium content on cell performance was rigorously tested by doping lithium-ion electrolytes with NaPF6 and testing these electrolytes in pouch cells. Overall, we show that sodium can be a major contaminant extracted into the electrolyte during cycling in pouch cells, and investigate the impact of sodium content on critical performance metrics.\n 1 Ochida, M.; Domi, Y.; Doi, T.; Tsubouchi, S.; Nakagawa, H.; Yamanaka, T.; Abe, T.; Ogumi, Z.

        "abstract": "Density functional theory (DFT) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations were performed to study the adsorption and distribution of Na ions on nitrogen-doped graphenes (NGs). DFT simulations revealed that both pyridinic and pyrrolic NGs enhanced Na adsorption even at higher Na concentrations by introducing electron-deficient vacancies. While Na ions tend to cluster on a pristine graphene, they separate when absorbed on pyridinic NGs due to stronger Na adsorption and Na-Na repulsion. Based on DFT energies, MC simulations were performed to study the distribution of Na on a pyridinic NG as a function of the pyridinic defect concentration and Na concentration. The average size of Na clusters decreases with increasing pyridinic defect concentration. The theoretical specific capacity increases monotonically as the pyridinic defect concentration is increased and reaches a maximum value at a concentration of ~7.5%. This theoretical study suggests that the pyridinic NGs hold promise as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries capable of enhancing Na adsorption, preventing Na clustering, and increasing the anode’s specific capacity.",

        "abstract": "Non-uniform zinc plating/stripping in aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) often leads to dendrites formation and low Coulombic efficiency (CE), limiting their large-scale application. In this study, a pre-corroded Zn (PC-Zn) anode with 3D ridge-like structure is constructed by a facile solution etching in sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2) solution. The surface preparation process can significantly remove impurities from the passivation layer of bare Zn anode, thus exposing a great quantity of active sites for easy plating/stripping. Moreover, the pre-corroded structure enables a uniform-distributed electric field to promote the 3D Zn2+ diffusion process and accelerate the transfer kinetics, thereby suppressing the zinc dendrites and interfacial side reactions. Consequently, symmetric cells with PC-Zn electrodes demonstrate remarkable stability, maintaining cycles for over 3200 h under 1 mA cm-2. The PC-Zn/VO2 full cell maintains a specific capacity of 361 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, and a capacity retention rate of ≈80% over 1000 cycles at 4 A g-1. Notably, no obvious dendrites and side reactions are detected after extended cycling.

Herein, a defect engineering strategy for the in situ encapsulation of single‐phase ternary iron phosphoselenide into porous carbon by robust chemical bonds with the formation of rod‐like multicavity nanohybrids (FePSe3@C) is presented.

In particular, after 1000 cycles at 20 C, the discharge capacity is 102.6 mA h g-1 with a capacity retention rate of 96%. This work reveals that the combination of carbon coating and nitrogen doping using sodium glutamate improves the electrochemical performance of electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "Heterostructure construction with mixed transition metal sulfides has been recognized as a promising strategy to boost the performance of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a carbon-decorated MoS2/CoS heterostructure on carbon cloth (MoS2/CoS@CC) as a free-standing anode for SIBs was synthesized via a facile growth-carbonization strategy. In the composite, the generated built-in electric field at MoS2 and CoS heterointerfaces is beneficial for elevating the electron conductivity, thus expediting the Na-ion transport rate. Moreover, different redox potentials between MoS2 and CoS can effectively mitigate the mechanical strain induced by repeated Na+ de-/intercalation, thus ensuring the structural integrity. In addition, the carbon skeleton derived from the carbonization of glucose can enhance the conductivity of the electrode and maintain the structural integrity. Consequently, the resulting MoS2/CoS@CC electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 605 mA h g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 after 100 cycles, and prominent rate performance (366 mA h g-1 at 8.0 A g-1). Theoretical calculations also confirm that the establishment of a MoS2/CoS heterojunction can powerfully promote the electron conductivity, thereby enhancing the Na-ion diffusion kinetics.",

It has been demonstrated that for HC anodes improved electrochemical performance, e.g., increase in coulombic efficiency (CE) and improved rate performance have been achieved in ether‐based electrolytes. Here, we investigate spray‐coated HC composite electrodes charged at low and high current rates in 1 M sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) in diglyme using half‐cell experiments. The pristine and cycled HC anodes were examined in terms of conductivity and their electrochemical properties after cycling. In 1 M NaPF6 ether‐based electrolyte, the spray‐coated HC composite electrodes reached a discharge capacity of 431 mA h g−1 at 0.1C that stays constant for 40 cycles, which is substantially higher than that obtained in carbonate‐based electrolytes. We investigated the formed interphase using scanning (electrochemical) probe microscopy (S(E)PM), X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time‐of‐flight secondary‐ion mass spectrometry (ToF‐SIMS), revealing distinct differences for longer cycling and at varying current rates which indicates that the properties of the formed SEI layers are influenced by the formation conditions.",

        "abstract": "We report an effective approach of utilizing multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as an active anode material in sodium ion batteries by expanding the interlayer distance in a few outer layers of multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The performance enhancement was investigated using a density functional tight binding (DFTB) molecular dynamics simulation. It is found that a sodium atom forms a stable bonding with the partially expanded MWCNT (PECNT) with the binding energy of -1.50 eV based on the density functional theory calculation with van der Waals correction, where a sodium atom is caged between the two carbon hexagons in the two consecutive MWCNTs. Wave function and charge density analyses show that this binding is physisorption in nature. This larger exothermic nature of binding energy favors the stable bonding between the PECNT and a sodium atom, and thereby, it helps to enhance the electrochemical performance. In the experimental works, partial opening of the MWCNT with the expanded interlayer has been designed by the well-known Hummer's method. It has been found that the introduction of functional groups causes a partial opening of the outer few layers of a MWCNT, with the inner core remaining undisturbed. The enhanced performance is due to an expanded interlayer of carbon nanotubes, which provide sufficient active sites for the sodium ions to adsorb as well as to intercalate into the carbon structure. The PECNT shows a high specific capacity of 510 mAh g-1 at a current density of 20 mA g-1, which is about 2.3 times the specific capacity obtained for a pristine MWCNT at the same current density. This specific capacity is higher when compared to other carbon-based materials. The PECNT also shows a satisfactory cyclic stability at a current density of 200 mA g-1 for 100 cycles. Based on our experimental and theoretical results, an alternative perspective for the storage of sodium ions in MWCNTs is proposed.",

        "abstract": "Electrochemical conversion reactions of metal oxides provide a new avenue to build high capacity anodes for sodium-ion batteries. However, the poor rate performance and cyclability of these conversion anodes remain a significant challenge for Na-ion battery applications because most of the conversion anodes suffer from sluggish kinetics and irreversible structural change during cycles. In this paper, we report an Fe2O3 single crystallites/reduced graphene oxide composite (Fe2O3/rGO), where the Fe2O3 single crystallites with a particle size of ∼300 nm were uniformly anchored on the rGO nanosheets, which provide a highly conductive framework to facilitate electron transport and a flexible matrix to buffer the volume change of the material during cycling. This Fe2O3/rGO composite anode shows a very high reversible capacity of 610 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1, a high Coulombic efficiency of 71% at the first cycle, and a strong cyclability with 82% capacity retention after 100 cycles, suggesting a potential feasibility for sodium-ion batteries. More significantly, the present work clearly illustrates that an electrochemical conversion anode can be made with high capacity utilization, strong rate capability, and stable cyclability through appropriately tailoring the lattice structure, particle size, and electronic conduction channels for a simple transition-metal oxide, thus offering abundant selections for development of low-cost and high-performance Na-storage electrodes.",

The resulting materials exhibited superior performance as the anode in lithium ion batteries (LIBs): they provide high reversible specific capacity (1144 mAh/g), excellent cyclability (nearly no capacity loss after 1000 cycles) and rate performance (805 mAh/g at 15 A/g). In addition, the hierarchical NiO/Ni/Graphene composites demonstrated promising performance as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Such a superior lithium and sodium storage performance is derived from the well-designed hierarchical hollow ball-in-ball structure of NiO/Ni/Graphene composites, which not only mitigates the volume expansion of NiO during the cycles but also provides a continuous highly conductive graphene matrix to facilitate the fast charge transfer and form a stable SEI layer.",

        "abstract": "The growing interest in Na-ion batteries as a “beyond lithium” technologies for energy storage drives the research for high-performance and environment-friendly materials. Na2Ti3O7 (NTO) as an eco-friendly, low-cost anode material shows a very low working potential of 0.3 V vs. Na+/Na but suffers from poor cycling stability, which properties can be significantly influenced by materials synthesis and treatment. Thus, in this work, the influence of the calcination time on the electrochemical performance and the reaction mechanism during cycling were investigated. NTO heat-treated for 48 h at 800 °C (NTO-48h) demonstrated enhanced cycling performance in comparison to NTO heat-treated for only 8 h (NTO-8h). The pristine material was thoroughly characterized by X-ray diffraction, laser granulometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and specific surface area measurements. The reaction mechanisms induced by sodiation/desodiation and cycling were investigated by operando XRD. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to evidence the evolution of the solid electrolyte interface layer (SEI) and modification of charge transfer resistances as well as the influence of cycling on capacity decay. The evolution of the crystallographic structure of NTO-48h revealed a more ordered structure and lower surface contamination compared to NTO-8h. Moreover, the residual Na4Ti3O7 phase detected after the sodium extraction step in NTO-8h seems correlated to the lower electrochemical performance of NTO-8h compared to NTO-48h.",

Benefiting from the homogeneous ion flux and exceptional sodiophilic features, the Nb2CTx nanoflakes embedded within the 3D scaffold regulate the uniform deposition of metallic Na with a stable SEI layer, achieving an ultralong cycle lifespan of 3000 h at 1 mA cm−2 with 1 mAh cm−2 and an impressive Coulombic efficiency of 99.68% over extended lifespan of 7064 h. Further, the in‐depth characterization analysis proves that the formed stable SEI layer consists of an inorganic NaF accumulated in the inner layer and loosely‐bound organic species in the outer layer. Remarkably, when integrated into a Na metal full cell, the reversible capacity reaches 90.22 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at 100 mA g−1.

To overcome this problem (issue), we investigated the use of polysaccharide-based 3D cross-linked network binders for Si anodes, in which the polysaccharide formed an effective 3D cross-linked network around Si particles via cross-linking of polysaccharide with citric acid (CA). Sodium alginate (SA), a natural polysaccharide extracted from brown algae, is a suitable binder material for Si anodes because its abundant hydroxyl (-OH) and carboxyl (-COOH) groups form hydrogen and covalent bonds with the -OH groups present on the Si surface. We found that CA-cross-linked (CA-SA) could effectively prevent the volume expansion of Si anodes through the formation of 3D cross-linked network structures. In addition, the CA-SA binders provide enhanced adhesion strength, enabling the fabrication of more robust electrodes than those prepared using binders with linear structures (\"linear binders\"). In particular, the fabricated Si-based electrode (high mass loading of 1.5 mg cm-2) with CA-SA binder exhibited outstanding areal capacity (∼2.7 mA h cm-2) and excellent cycle retention (∼100% after 100 cycles).",

        "abstract": "Sodium-based dual-ion batteries (SDIBs) have become a new type of energy storage device with great application value because of their high operating voltage, high energy density, and low cost. However, transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) anodes show unsatisfactory Na+ electrochemical performance owing to the low intrinsic conductivity and inferior ion transport kinetics. Here, an elaborate design is developed to prepare a composite of WSSe nanosheets supported on a 3D cross-networked porous carbon skeleton (WSSe@CPCS), which possesses en-rich anion vacancies and WSSe with expanded inter-layer spacing, as well as an interconnected porous structure. As a result, the WSSe@CPCS anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) exhibits preeminent reversible capacities, excellent cycle stability, and superior rate capability. The systematic electrochemical kinetic analysis and density functional theory results further show that the effect of anion vacancies and CPCS synergistically enhances the conductivity and reduces charge transfer resistance, thus making a great contribution to fast reaction kinetics. Finally, the implementations of the WSSe@CPCS anode in progressive SIB and DIB full-cell configurations exhibit satisfactory performance, which reveals their widely practical application. This research will provide an exciting approach to designing advanced defect-structured tungsten-based TMD materials for SIBs, DIBs, and even a broad range of energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) have attracted attention for their low cost and environmental friendliness. Unfortunately, commercialization has been hampered by several problems with dendrite growth and side reactions. Herein, we select sodium tartrate (TA-Na) as a dual-functional electrolyte additive to enhance the reversibility of AZIBs. The tartrate anions are preferentially adsorbed on the Zn surface, and then the highly nucleophilic carboxylate will coordinate with Zn2+ to promote the desolvation of [Zn(H2O)6]2+, leading to uniform Zn deposition on the beneficial (002) plane and inhibiting side reactions and dendrite growth. Consequently, the Zn|Zn cells show a long-term cycling stability of over 1500 cycles at 0.5 mA cm-2. Moreover, the Ta-Na additive improves the performance of Zn||MnO2 full cells, evidenced by a cycling life of 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1 under practical conditions with a limited Zn anode (negative/positive capacity ratio of 10/1) and controlled electrolyte (electrolyte/capacity ratio of 20 μL mAh-1).",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have attracted more interest as an alternative to Lithium-ion batteries because of the abundance and cost effectiveness. However, searching for suitable anode materials with high-rate and stable cycling performance is still needed to promote their practical application. Herein, three-dimensional Na2Ti3O7 nanowire arrays with enriched surface vacancies endowed by phosphorus doping are reported. When evaluated as anodes for sodium-ion batteries, the electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 290 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C, good rate capability (50 mAh g-1 at 20 C), and stable cycling capability (98% capacity retention over 3100 cycles at 20 C). The superior electrochemical performance is attributed to the synergistic effects of the unique nanowire arrays and phosphorus doping. The rational structures can provide convenient channels to facilitate ions/electrons transport and improve the capacitive contributions. Moreover, the phosphorus-doping-induced surface vacancies not only provide more active sites but also improve the intrinsic electrical conductivity of Na2Ti3O7, which will enable the electrode materials with excellent sodium storage performance. This work may provide an effective strategy for the synthesis of other anode materials with fast electrochemical reaction kinetics and good sodium storage performance.",

        "abstract": "Room-temperature Na ion batteries (NIBs) have attracted great attention because of the widely available, abundant sodium resources and potentially low cost. Currently, the challenge of the NIB development is due primarily to the lack of a high-performance anode, while the Na metal anode holds great promise considering its highest specific capacity of 1165 mA h/g and lowest anodic potential. However, an uneven deposit, relatively infinite volume change, and dendritic growth upon plating/stripping cycles cause a low Coulombic efficiency, poor cycling performance, and severe safety concerns. Here, a stable Na carbonized wood (Na-wood) composite anode was fabricated via a rapid melt infusion (about 5 s) into channels of carbonized wood by capillary action. The channels function as a high-surface-area, conductive, mechanically stable skeleton, which lowers the effective current density, ensures a uniform Na nucleation, and restricts the volume change over cycles. As a result, the Na-wood composite anode exhibited flat plating/stripping profiles with smaller overpotentials and stable cycling performance over 500 h at 1.0 mA/cm2 in a common carbonate electrolyte system. In sharp comparison, the planar Na metal electrode showed a much shorter cycle life of 100 h under the same test conditions.",

The unhindered ion transmission greatly benefits from honeycomb‐structured fibers with huge electrolyte uptake (376.7%) and the polymer's inherent transport ability. Additionally, polar polymer chains consisting of polyethersulfone and polyvinylidene customize the highly aggregated solvation structure of electrolytes via substantial solvent immobilization, facilitating ion‐conductivity‐enhanced inorganic‐rich solid‐electrolyte interphase with remarkable interface endurance. With the reliable mechanical strength of the separator, the assembled sodium‐ion full cell delivers significantly improved energy density and high safety, enabling stable operation under cutting and rolling. The as‐prepared separator can further be generalized to lithium‐based batteries for which apparent dendrite inhibition and cyclability are accessible and demonstrates its potential for practical application.",

        "abstract": "Developing hard carbon with a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and very good cycling stability is of great importance for practical sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Defects and oxygen-containing groups grown along either the carbon edges or the layers, however, are inevitable in hard carbon and can cause a tremendous density of irreversible Na+ sites, decreasing the efficiency and therefore causing failure of the battery. Thus, eliminating these unexpected defect structures is significant for enhancing the battery performance. Herein, we develop a strategy of applying a soft-carbon coating onto free-standing hard-carbon electrodes, which greatly hinders the formation of defects and oxygen-containing groups on hard carbon. The electrochemical results show that the soft-carbon-coated, free-standing hard-carbon electrodes can achieve an ultrahigh ICE of 94.1% and long cycling performance (99% capacity retention after 100 cycles at a current density of 20 mA g-1), demonstrating their great potential in practical sodium storage systems. The sodium storage mechanism was also investigated by operando Raman spectroscopy. Our sodium storage mechanism extends the \"adsorption-intercalation-pore filling-deposition\" model. We propose that the pore filling in the plateau area might be divided into two parts: (1) sodium could fill in the pores near the inner wall of the carbon layer; (2) when the sodium in the inner wall pores is close to saturation, the sodium could be further deposited onto the existing sodium.",

        "title": "Anodic Dissolution of Aluminum in Sodium-Ion Batteries: A Comparison of Electrolyte and Solvent Composition",
        "abstract": "The anodic dissolution behavior of aluminum was studied in various sodium-based electrolyte solutions using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The aim was to investigate how different electrolyte and solvent compositions affect the dissolution process. The electrolyte solutions tested included 0.284 m NaBOB in TEP, 1.00 m NaPF6 in TEP, 1.00 m NaPF6 in EC:DEC, 1.00 m NaPF6 in diglyme, 1.00 m NaFSI in PC, and 1.00 m NaFSI in TEP. SEM imaging was also performed to analyze the morphological changes of the aluminum surface during the dissolution process.\n To emphasize any dissolution process, relatively large volumes (3-5 ml) of electrolyte solution was used in polytetrafluoroethylene beaker cells. A three-electrode configuration was used to obtain the desired accuracy in the electrochemical tests.\n Severe anodic aluminum dissolution was not observed below 5.3 V vs. Na+/Na in electrolyte solutions containing NaBOB in TEP, NaPF6 in TEP, NaPF6 in EC:DEC, or NaPF6 in diglyme. Anodic dissolution was, however, detected in electrolyte solutions containing NaFSI in PC and NaFSI in TEP, affirming that caution should be exercised when using FSI-anions with aluminum current collectors.1,2 Yet, the choice of solvent used with NaFSI appeared to influenced the anodic dissolution behavior of aluminum. Here, TEP seemed to suppress the initial dissolution, compared to PC.\n In summary, this study provides insights into the anodic dissolution behavior of aluminum in sodium-ion batteries, and highlights the significance of selecting appropriate solution compositions to mitigate potential anodic dissolution issues. The findings contribute to the understanding of the electrochemical behavior of aluminum in the context of sodium-ion batteries, and provides a foundation for further studies.\n The authors acknowledge The Swedish Energy Agency via project no. 50177-1, VINNOVA via projects no. 2022-01465 and 2019-00064 (Batteries Sweden), and H2020 research and innovation programme under Grant agreements No 958174 and 963542 for financial support.\n 1.

        "abstract": "Inorganic electrolytes for solid state batteries with Li metallic anodes must combine properties such as high ionic conductivity, chemical stability, and resistance to failure due to propagation of Li dendrites. Abundance of experimental evidence suggests that cracking of the solid electrolytes due to pressure exerted by lithium plating into the material defects is the primary source of failure [1]. This is due to inherent brittleness of the ceramic ionic conductors, i.e. their inability to reduce stress by means other than fracture. Unlike ceramics, plastic deformation in glass can be achieved via shear and (or) by densification. Both mechanisms can be operational in glasses with reduced content of glass formers relative to the content of glass modifiers – i.e. inverted glasses. Using the example of lithium phosphorous oxynitride, Lipon, we demonstrate how these two mechanisms are capable of accommodating applied stress while avoiding creation of new surfaces by cracking. We investigate the resistance to fracture in Lipon-like glasses and the underlying connection to their composition via instrumented nano-indentation, Raman spectroscopy, and numerical simulations. We observe enhancement of isochoric shear with increase of Li content, similarly to the reports of increased plasticity in sodium aluminoborate glases with high alkali content [2]. Nano-indentation demonstrates that Lipon is extremely resistant to fracture, compared to other inorganic solid electrolytes [3].\n [1] Porz, T. Swamy, B.W. Sheldon, D. Rettenwander, T. Fromling, H.L.

However, the infeasibility of graphite and silicon electrodes in sodium-ion storage makes it urgent to develop high-performance anode materials. Herein, α-MnSe nanorods derived from δ-MnO2 (δ-α-MnSe) are constructed as anodes for SIBs. It is verified that α-MnSe will be transferred into β-MnSe after the initial Na-ion insertion/extraction, and δ-α-MnSe undergoes typical conversion mechanism using a Mn-ion for charge compensation in the subsequent charge-discharge process. First-principles calculations support that Na-ion migration in defect-free α-MnSe can drive the lattice distortion to phase transition (alpha → beta) in thermodynamics and dynamics. The formed β-MnSe with robust lattice structure and small Na-ion diffusion barrier boosts great structure stability and electrochemical kinetics. Hence, the δ-α-MnSe electrode contributes excellent rate capability and superior cyclic stability with long lifespan over 1000 cycles and low decay rate of 0.0267% per cycle. Na-ion full batteries with a high energy density of 281.2 Wh·kg-1 and outstanding cyclability demonstrate the applicability of δ-α-MnSe anode.",

The incorporation of thiophene functionalized groups and nickel (Ⅱ) ion in the molecular design of porphyrins enabled stable and excellent electrochemical performance in sodium storage systems. Benefiting from multiple charge storage sites and bipolar characteristics, the NiTTP anode has a reversible capacity of 434 mAh g−1 at a current density of 25 mA g−1. An excellent long-term cycling stability and high average voltage were obtained when NiTTP was used as a cathode. In a symmetrical battery, where NiTTP was used as both cathode and anode materials, a high average voltage of 2.3 V and a practical energy density of 93 Wh kg−1 was achieved.

In this work, a simple electrospinning method has been used to synthesize In2S3/C nanofibers for the first time. In lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the In2S3/C nanofiber electrode can not only deliver a high initial reversible specific capacity of 696.4 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1, but also shows ultra-long cycle life with a capacity retention of 80.5% after 600 cycles at 1000 mA g-1. In sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), the In2S3/C nanofibers electrode can exhibit a high initial reversible specific capacity (393.7 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1) and excellent cycling performance with a high capacity retention of 97.3% after 300 cycles at 1000 mA g-1. The excellent electrochemical properties mainly benefited from In2S3 being encapsulated by a carbon matrix, which buffers the volume expansion and significantly improves the conductivity of the composite. Furthermore, the structural evolution of In2S3 during the first lithiation/delithiation and sodiation/desodiation processes has been illustrated by ex situ XRD. The results confirm that the reaction mechanism of In2S3 in both LIBs and SIBs can be summarized as conversion reactions and alloying reactions, which provide theoretical support for the development of In2S3 in the field of electrochemistry.",

However, the sodium polysulfide shuttle effect and dendritic growth pose significant challenges to their practical applications. In this study, we apply diverse disciplinary backgrounds to introduce a novel method to stimulate polarized BaTiO3 (BTO) nanoparticles on the separator. This approach generates more charges due to the piezoelectric effect under stronger driving forces produced by applying a controllable acoustic field at the outer edge of the cell. The acoustically stimulated BTO attracts more polysulfides, thus reducing the shuttling effect from the cathode to the anode and ultimately enhancing the battery performance. Meanwhile, the acoustic waves create additional streaming flows, improving the uniformity of the sodium ion dispersion, enhancing the sodium ion transport and reducing the possibility of sodium dendrite development. We believe that this work offers a new strategy for the development of high-performance Na–S batteries.",

        "abstract": "Owing to several advantages of metallic sodium (Na), such as a relatively high theoretical capacity, low redox potential, wide availability, and low cost, Na metal batteries are being extensively studied, which are expected to play a major role in the fields of electric vehicles and grid-scale energy storage. Although considerable efforts have been devoted to utilizing MXene-based materials for suppressing Na dendrites, achieving a stable cycling of Na metal anodes remains extremely challenging due to, for example, the low Coulombic efficiency (CE) caused by the severe side reactions. Herein, a g-C3N4 layer was attached in situ on the Ti3C2 MXene surface, inducing a surface state reconstruction and thus forming a stable hetero-interphase with excellent sodiophilicity between the MXene and g-C3N4 to inhibit side reactions and guide uniform Na ion flux. The 3D construction can not only lower the local current density to facilitate uniform Na plating/stripping but also mitigate volume change to stabilize the electrolyte/electrode interphase. Thus, the 3D Ti3C2 MXene@g-C3N4 nanocomposite enables much enhanced average CEs (99.9% at 1 mA h cm-2, 0.5 mA cm-2) in asymmetric half cells, long-term stability (up to 700 h) for symmetric cells, and stable cycling (up to 800 cycles at 2 C), together with outstanding rate capability (up to 20 C), of full cells. The present study demonstrates an approach in developing practically high performance for Na metal anodes.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we have investigated the key factors dictating the cyclic performance of a new type of hybrid sodium-based flow batteries (HNFBs) that can operate at room temperature with high cell voltages (>3 V), multiple electron transfer redox reactions per active ion, and decoupled design of power and energy. HNFBs are composed of a molten Na-Cs alloy anode, flowing aqueous catholyte, and a Na-β″-Al2O3 solid electrolyte as the separator. The surface functionalization of graphite felt electrodes for the flowing aqueous catholyte has been studied for its effectiveness in enhancing V(2+)/V(3+), V(3+)/V(4+), and V(4+)/V(5+) redox couples. The V(4+)/V(5+) redox reaction has been further investigated at different cell operation temperatures for its cyclic stability and how the properties of the solid electrolyte membrane play a role in cycling. These fundamental understandings provide guidelines for improving the cyclic performance and stability of HNFBs with aqueous catholytes. We show that the HNFB with aqueous V-ion catholyte can reach high storage capacity (∼70% of the theoretical capacity) with good Coulombic efficiency (90% ± 1% in 2-30 cycles) and cyclic performance (>99% capacity retention for 30 cycles). It demonstrates, for the first time, the potential of high capacity HNFBs with aqueous catholytes, good capacity retention and long cycling life. This is also the first demonstration that Na-β″-Al2O3 solid electrolyte can be used with aqueous electrolyte at near room temperature for more than 30 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as potential alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), particularly for large-scale applications. Alloy-type anode materials for sodium-ion batteries are esteemed as prospective candidate materials for sodium-ion anodes, owing to their elevated theoretical capacity, heightened utilization efficiency, and minimal production of insulating byproducts. However, the severe volume changes and sluggish ion diffusion kinetics can lead to irreversible particle fragmentation and reaggregation phenomena, ultimately resulting in electrode degradation. Additionally, repetitive volume changes can cause an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). This study presents the synthesis of chloride-ion-modulated bimetallic SnSb/C nanoparticle anode materials, highlighting the following advantages: (i) Designing a bimetallic SnSb alloy structure serves to buffer the structural stresses generated during sodium insertion/extraction processes, effectively mitigating particle fracture phenomena induced by electrode material expansion/contraction. (ii) Nanostructuring both alloy materials enables the full utilization of active materials and shortens diffusion pathways, thereby significantly enhancing the diffusion rate of sodium ions. (iii) Introducing a carbonaceous matrix serves to alleviate self-agglomeration phenomena of the material during charge/discharge cycles, enhancing the material's conductivity and structural stability. (iv) Utilizing chloride-ion interface modification to achieve a chloride-rich solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) enhances battery performance.",

        "abstract": "Biomass-derived hard carbon materials are considered as the most promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their abundant sources, environmental friendliness, and excellent electrochemical performance. Although much research exists on the effect of pyrolysis temperature on the microstructure of hard carbon materials, there are few reports that focus on the development of pore structure during the pyrolysis process. In this study, corncob is used as the raw material to synthesize hard carbon at a pyrolysis temperature of 1000~1600 °C, and their interrelationationship between pyrolysis temperature, microstructure and sodium storage properties are systematically studied. With the pyrolysis temperature increasing from 1000 °C to 1400 °C, the number of graphite microcrystal layers increases, the long-range order degree rises, and the pore structure shows a larger size and wide distribution. The specific capacity, the initial coulomb efficiency, and the rate performance of hard carbon materials improve simultaneously. However, as the pyrolysis temperature rises further to 1600 °C, the graphite-like layer begins to curl, and the number of graphite microcrystal layers reduces. In return, the electrochemical performance of the hard carbon material decreases. This model of pyrolysis temperatures–microstructure–sodium storage properties will provide a theoretical basis for the research and application of biomass hard carbon materials in SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Electrochemical ion storage behaviors of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, as a representative transition metal oxide for an environmentally benign and low-cost anode for a sodium-ion battery, are thoroughly investigated through a combination of electrochemical analysis and diagnostics of Fe3O4 electrode cells, X-ray-based and spectroscopic analysis of material structure evolution as functions of depth of discharge (DoD) and state of charge (SoC), and first principle modeling. The gravimetric capacity is found to be 50 mA h/g for bulk Fe3O4 (50 nm average crystallite size) and 100 mA h/g─about a tenth of the theoretical prediction for complete conversion─for Fe3O4 nanoparticles (8.7 nm average particle size), respectively. A fundamental and mechanistic study of material evolution as functions of DoD and SoC shows that Fe3O4 does not allow electrochemical incorporation of Na+ ions into the empty cation positions of the inverse spinel structure, leading to our assertion that electrochemical intercalation of Na+ ions to conversion of the Fe3O4 anode in sodium-ion batteries is nonviable. A density functional theory investigation points to the impracticality of the intercalation of Na+ ions into Fe3O4 and further validates our experimental findings. We propose several possible mechanisms corresponding to the observed low capacity, including formation of solid electrolyte interphases with unfavorable properties and adsorption of Na+ ions onto surfaces of nanoparticles and/or at heterointerfaces in Fe3O4 composite electrodes in a NaPF6-based electrolyte system.",

        "abstract": "Sodium metal battery is considered as one of the most promising energy storage/conversion devices due to their high energy density, and abundant sodium reserves. However, its development is hampered by the limited metallic utilization and detrimental sodium dendrite growth ascribed to the unstable, and fragile solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Here, the high stable and modulus SEI is constructed with a component of a thin and dense layer of high Na‐ion conductive Na2SiO3. It is in situ formed by the reaction between sodium anode and fish‐skin structure separator, which exhibits a 3D porous polyvinylidene fluoride‐based framework embedded with thin and robust vermiculite sheets. The robust interphase cannot only suppress sodium dendrite growth but also enable high energy density with small interphase‐consumed Na ions in anode‐less batteries. Accordingly, the as‐assembled NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2//Na cell shows 83% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at a rate of 5 °C. Moreover, the proof‐of‐concept pouch cells deliver an energy density of 205 Wh kg−1 (based on the total mass of the battery), and high safety (not catching fire after punctured) under anode‐less condition (with a low negative/positive capacity ratio of ≈2.1).",

        "abstract": "Due to the Earth's scarcity of lithium, replacing lithium with earth-abundant and low-cost sodium for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) has recently become a promising substitute for lithium-ion batteries. However, the shortage of appropriate anode materials limits the development of SIBs. Here, a dual-carbon conductive network enhanced GeP5 (GeP5/acetylene black/partially reduced graphene oxide sheets (GeP5/AB/p-rGO)) composite is successfully prepared by a facile ball milling method. The dual-carbon network not only provides more transport pathways for electrons but also relaxes the huge volume change of the electrode material during the charge/discharge process. Compared with only AB- or GO-modified GeP5 (GeP5/AB or GeP5/GO) composite, the GeP5/AB/p-rGO composite shows a superior sodium storage performance with an excellent rate and cycle performance. It delivers a high reversible capacity of 597.5 and 175 mAh/g at the current density of 0.1 and 5.0 A/g, respectively. Furthermore, at the current density of 0.5 A/g, the GeP5/AB/p-rGO composite shows the reversible capacity of 400 mAh/g after 50 cycles with a little capacity attenuation.

This remarkable ICE is attributed to the presence of an inorganic‐rich, thin, and robust solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. Furthermore, the material demonstrates excellent cycling stability, showing a capacity retention of 99.5% after 500 cycles at 280 mA g−1. Additionally, when it works as the anode material in a sodium‐ion full cell without presodiation, it reaches a high energy density of 212 Wh kg−1 and a superior stability, e.g., retaining 93.1 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1 with a capacity retention of 91.3%. The sodium storage capacity of this material is primarily attributed to a combined adsorption‐intercalation/filling effect as confirmed by in situ XRD and ex situ Raman analyses. These findings make this biomass‐derived hard carbon material a promising candidate for commercial application of sodium‐ion batteries, achieving high performance at low cost.",

Herein, with the assistance of a simple calcination method and common raw materials, the environmentally friendly and nontoxic N‐doped C@Zn3B2O6 composite is directly synthesized and proved to be a potential anode material for NIBs. The composite demonstrates a high reversible charge capacity of 446.2 mAh g−1 and a safe and suitable average voltage of 0.69 V, together with application potential in full cells (discharge capacity of 98.4 mAh g−1 and long cycle performance of 300 cycles at 1000 mA g−1). In addition, the sodium‐ion storage mechanism of N‐doped C@Zn3B2O6 is subsequently studied through air‐insulated ex situ characterizations of X‐ray diffraction (XRD), X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier‐transform infrared (FT‐IR) spectroscopy, and is found to be rather different from previous reports on borate anode materials for NIBs and lithium‐ion batteries. The reaction mechanism is deduced and proposed as: Zn3B2O6 + 6Na+ + 6e− ⇋ 3Zn + B2O3 ∙ 3Na2O, which indicates that the generated boracic phase is electrochemically active and participates in the later discharge/charge progress.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfide‐based anodes usually suffer from huge volumetric change and sluggish reaction kinetics, hindering their application for long‐term and high‐power/energy sodium‐ion batteries. Herein, a new design of CoS2‐xSex (0≤x≤2) nanocrystals with highly controllable selenium substitution and S, Se‐codoped graphene immobilization (CoS2‐xSex@SG) is proposed to tune the reaction kinetics and structural stability. The nanocrystal‐on‐graphene structure and robust C─S &C─Se bonding rivets between CoS2‐xSex and SG greatly improve the structural stability of the CoS2‐xSex@SG. Electrochemical performance, kinetic analysis, and theoretical calculation reveal that Se substitution plays a double‐edged role in sodium storage: the increase of Se substitution content enhances the Na+ diffusion kinetics but decreases the Na‐storage capacity. When the Se substitution content is 0.4, the CoS1.6Se0.4@SG electrode demonstrates the best performance: high initial Coulombic efficiency (95.5%), ultrahigh rate capability (412.8 mAh g−1 at 30 A g−1), and ultra‐stable cycling performance (97.6% capacity retention after 1000 cycles). In situ/ex situ measurements further unveil that the conversion reaction between Co0 and Na2S/Na2Se generates the micro‐scaled CoSe2–CoS2 heterostructure, synergistically improving the Na‐storage active sites and reaction kinetics. This work provides a controllable anion substitution strategy to balance the Na+ storage active sites and kinetics with potential applications for high‐power/energy sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Recent advancements have highlighted the P2-layered Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 (NNMO) cathode material as a leading candidate for next-generation sodium-ion batteries due to its superior specific capacity. Traditional solid-state synthesis methods, while straightforward and scalable, struggle with challenges such as achieving homogeneous atomic-level elemental distribution and mitigating the formation of intermediate phases during powder mixing. In contrast, the molten salt synthesis method offers a controllable and efficient alternative for producing uniform materials with varied chemical compositions and structures. In this study, we utilize sodium chloride as the molten salt flux, with Na2CO3, NiO, and Mn2O3 as reactants, to synthesize single-crystal MS-NNMO. This method yields an NNMO with an initial reversible capacity of 90.6 mAh g−1 at 0.1C across a voltage range of 2.0-4.2 V, demonstrating 88.5% capacity retention after 100 cycles. Long-term stability is further evidenced by an 83.9% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 1C. In full cell tests, MS-NNMO paired with a hard carbon anode shows 90.3% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 1C. Additionally, MS-NNMO exhibits exceptional bulk stability, with no impurity peaks detected after 1 hour of water exposure, underscoring its superior air stability.

        "abstract": "Achieving cost-effective and sustainable solutions for large-scale energy storage is critical for advancing the global clean energy transition. The intermittent nature of green energy underscores the inadequacy of current large scale energy storage technologies like pumped hydroelectricity which is susceptible to geographic and water resource constraints, making batteries a prime candidate for this role. Although lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy and power density are a viable solution, the high cost and uneven distribution of lithium reserves limits the widespread application of LIBs for grid energy storage. Considering these developments and the challenges posed by limited lithium reserves, sustainable and low-cost sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) emerge as a promising alternative.\n Among the various battery electrode materials, manganese dioxide (MnO2) stands out as a promising choice for large-scale energy storage applications due to its earth abundance, cost-effectiveness and non-toxic nature. Although MnO2 is known as a pseudocapacitive material with superior cycling stability in aqueous electrolytes, its dissolution in non-aqueous electrolytes has restricted its widespread use in long lifetime batteries. In this study, we demonstrate that an ether-based electrolyte solution (1M NaClO4 in diglyme) is able to achieve stable cycling of electrodeposited ε-MnO2 as a cathode for SIBs, reaching a over 75% capacity retention over 1000 cycles. This response surpasses conventional ester-based electrolytes (58% of 1M NaClO4 in EC/PC). A comparative cycling stability study, coupled with electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance characterization, validates the efficacy of the ether-based electrolyte in mitigating MnO2 dissolution. Furthermore, the integration of 3D printed graphene aerogel (3D GA) as a scaffold for electrodeposited MnO2 leads to enhanced electrochemical performance of the MnO2 electrode (3D MnO2/GA), resulting in a high areal capacity of 4.4 mAh cm-2 at a current density of 10 mA cm-2. The 3D MnO2/GA electrode possesses scalable electrochemical performance with mass loadings from 20 mg cm-2 to 80 mg cm-2. Using this electrode, a high mass loaded sodium-ion battery (SIB) device was fabricated by using utilizing 58 mg cm-2 3D MnO2/GA as the cathode and 16 mg cm-2 dip-coated TiO2@Cu foam as the anode. This MnO2 | TiO2 device delivered a notable areal capacity of 6.2 mWh cm-2 and a high areal power density of 70.7 mW cm-2. Moreover, the SIB device demonstrates 85% capacity retention after 500 cycles, underscoring the stable cycling of this high-energy and power-density SIB device.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are gaining attention as a better and more economical option than lithium-ion batteries, owing to the abundance and low cost of sodium in comparison to lithium. The anode component of rechargeable batteries plays a vital role in obtaining superior energy and power density. Consequently, the investigation of novel materials for SIBs with enhanced performance is imperative. Transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs) are found to be promising contenders for this purpose, particularly MoS2 due to their two-dimensional open framework, structural tunability, and high theoretical specific capacity as an anode material in sodium ion storage. In this regard, we conducted a facile strategy to synthesize MoS2 and aluminium-doped MoS2 incorporated into reduced graphene oxide (rGO) using the hydrothermal method. The structural and morphological properties of the samples have been explored through X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) measurements which revealed that the addition of aluminium increased the interlayer spacing of the (002) plane of MoS2 nanosheets and stabilized it in metallic 1T phase. The enhanced interlayer distance and improved conductivity of the electrode material displayed a significantly higher initial discharge specific capacity of around 750 mAhg−1 which is stabilized around 380 mAhg−1 at the current rate of 50 mAg−1 after 10 cycles as investigated through galvanostatic charge-discharge measurement. The long cycling test for 200 cycles revealed the capacity retention of ~65% and ~55 % at the current density of 100 and 300 mAg-1, respectively. The kinetic behavior of the Na-ion is studied employing cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and the diffusion coefficient of Na-ion in the bulk of the electrode was found to be in the range of 10-10 to 10-12 cm2s-1. Additionally, in-situ EIS analysis demonstrates the electrode's electrochemical kinetics at different charge-discharge states by showing variations in charge transfer resistance. Ex-situ XRD and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrated the coexistence of 1T and 2H phases, and field-emission SEM validated the stable morphology after cycling.\n \n Keywords: Sodium-ion batteries, Transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs), Anode material, MoS2\n \n \n References:\n \n \n N.Tapia-Ruiz et al., 2021 Roadmap for sodium-ion batteries, J.

        "abstract": "Metal sulfides are gaining prominence as conversion anode materials for lithium/sodium ion batteries due to their higher specific capacities but suffers from low stability and reversibility issues. In this work, the electrochemical properties of CuS anode material has been successfully enhanced by its composite formation using graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4). The CuS nanoparticles are distributed evenly in the exfoliated g-C3N4 matrix rendering higher electronic conductivity and space for volume alterations during the repeated discharge/charge cycles. The 0.8CuS:0.2g-C3N4 composite when used as an anode for lithium ion coin cell exhibits a reversible capacity of 478.4 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 2.0 A g−1 after a run of 1000 cycles which is better than that reported for CuS composites with any other carbon-based matrix. The performance is equally impressive when 0.8CuS:0.2g-C3N4 composite is used as an anode in a sodium ion coin cell and a reversible capacity of 408 mA h g−1 is obtained at a current rate of 2.0 A g−1 after a run of 800 cycles. A sodium ion full cell with NVP cathode and 0.8CuS:0.2g-C3N4 composite anode has been fabricated and cycled for 100 runs at a current rate of 0.1 A g−1. It can be inferred that the g-C3N4 matrix improves the ion transfer properties, alleviates the volume alteration happening in the anode during the discharge/charge process and also helps in preventing the leaching of polysulfides generated during the electrochemical process.",

        "abstract": "Alloying-type antimony (Sb) with high theoretical capacity is a promising anode candidate for both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Given the larger radius of Na+ (1.02 Å) than Li+ (0.76 Å), it was generally believed that the Sb anode would experience even worse capacity degradation in SIBs due to more substantial volumetric variations during cycling when compared to LIBs. However, the Sb anode in SIBs unexpectedly exhibited both better electrochemical and structural stability than in LIBs, and the mechanistic reasons that underlie this performance discrepancy remain undiscovered. Here, using substantial in situ transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman techniques complemented by theoretical simulations, we explicitly reveal that compared to lithiation/delithiation process, sodiation/desodiation process of Sb anode displays a previously unexplored two-stage alloying/dealloying mechanism with polycrystalline and amorphous phases as the intermediates featuring improved resilience to mechanical damage, contributing to superior cycling stability in SIBs. Additionally, the better mechanical properties and weaker atomic interaction of Na-Sb alloys than Li-Sb alloys favor enabling mitigated mechanical stress, accounting for enhanced structural stability as unveiled by theoretical simulations. Our finding delineates the mechanistic origins of enhanced cycling stability of Sb anode in SIBs with potential implications for other large-volume-change electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "Carbon-encapsulated Sn@N-doped carbon tubes with submicron diameters were obtained via the simple reduction of C@SnO2@N-doped carbon composites that were fabricated by a hydrothermal approach. Sn nanoparticles encapsulated in carbon layers were distributed uniformly on the surfaces of the N-doped carbon nanotubes. The electrochemical performances of the composites were systematically investigated as anode materials in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The composite electrode could attain a good reversible capacity of 398.4 mAh g-1 when discharging at 100 mA g-1, with capacity retention of 67.3% and very high Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% over 150 cycles. This good cycling performance, when compared to only 17.5 mAh g-1 delivered by bare Sn particles prepared via the same method without the presence of N-doped carbon, could be mainly ascribed to the uniform distribution of the precursor SnO2 on the substrate of N-doped carbon tubes with three-dimensional structure, which provides more reaction sites to reduce the diffusion distance of Na+, further facilitating Na+-ion diffusion and relieves the huge volume expansion during charging/discharging. These outcomes imply that such a Sn/C composite would provide more options as an anode candidate for SIBs.",

N‐doped carbon mitigates the structure stress/strain during alloying/dealloying, optimizes the ionic/electronic diffusion, and provides fast electron transfer and structural stability. Due to the excellent structure, Bi@N‐C shows excellent Na storage performance in SIBs in terms of good cycling stability and rate capacity in half cells and full cells. The fundamental mechanism of the outstanding electrochemical performance of Bi@N‐C has been demonstrated through synchrotron in‐situ XRD, atomic force microscopy, ex‐situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculation.

Herein, a general and scalable solvent-exchange strategy is presented for uniform dispersion of few-layer MoS2 (f-MoS2 ) from high-boiling-point solvents (N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), N,N-dimethyl formaldehyde (DMF), etc.) into low-boiling-point solvents (water, ethanol, etc.).

Benefiting from its ultrathin feature, largely exposed active surface, highly conductive framework and excellent structural integrity, the 2D core-shell architecture of MoS2 -NCS exhibits an outstanding reversible capacity and excellent cycling performance, achieving high initial discharge capacity of 1087.5 and 508.6 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 , capacity retentions of 95.6% and 94.2% after 500 and 250 charge/discharge cycles at 1 A g-1 , for lithium/sodium ion storages, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Autonomic self-healing (SH), namely, the ability to repair damages from mechanical stress spontaneously, is polarizing attention in the field of new-generation electrochemical devices. This property is highly attractive to enhance the durability of rechargeable Li-ion batteries (LIBs) or Na-ion batteries (SIBs), where high-performing anode active materials (silicon, phosphorus, etc.) are strongly affected by volume expansion and phase changes upon ion insertion. Here, we applied a SH strategy, based on the dynamic quadruple hydrogen bonding, to nanosized black phosphorus (BP) anodes for Na-ion cells. The goal is to overcome drastic capacity decay and short lifetime, resulting from mechanical damages induced by the volumetric expansion/contraction upon sodiation/desodiation. Specifically, we developed novel ureidopyrimidinone (UPy)-telechelic systems and related blends with poly(ethylene oxide) as novel and green binders alternative to the more conventional ones, such as polyacrylic acid and carboxymethylcellulose, which are typically used in SIBs. BP anodes show impressively improved (more than 6 times) capacity retention when employing the new SH polymeric blend. In particular, the SH electrode still works at a current density higher than 3.5 A g–1, whereas the standard BP electrode exhibits very poor performances already at current densities lower than 0.5 A g–1. This is the result of better adhesion, buffering properties, and spontaneous damage reparation.",

        "title": "Effect of Polyvinylidene Fluoride Binder Distribution on Dry Spray-Coated Graphite Electrodes for Lithium-Ion Batteries for Electric Vehicle Applications",
        "abstract": "Dry process manufacturing techniques, which involve fabricating electrodes without the use of solvents and directly depositing electrode materials onto current collectors, have emerged as an alternative to traditional lithium-ion battery (LIB) electrode preparation methods1. In the conventional wet process, solvent-based mixtures, known as slurries, are coated onto metallic current collectors. These slurries typically contain electrochemically active material, conductive additive, polymer binder, and solvent for binder dissolution. For cathodes, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF) dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) is commonly used.2 The growing interest in solvent-free techniques is due to their numerous advantages over traditional methods. For instance, eliminating the use of NMP during cathode production reduces energy consumption by almost 47% during the manufacturing process and decreases total costs by around 15%.3,4 This approach is also relevant for anodes, where a mix of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) dissolved in water is used. The uniform mixing distribution of the binder and CB additive materials throughout the active material is crucial for manufacturing dry-processed LIB electrodes because it can affect the electrode characteristics such as homogeneity of binder distribution, porosity, adhesion, and cohesion between active material and carbon black (CB) conducting agent particles and the current collector, electrical properties, and therefore the battery performance5–10.\n For our study, we prepared negative electrode powder mixtures consisting of graphite and a low-content of PVdF through a dry-mixing process at room temperature, varying the mixing time. Then, these powder electrode mixtures were subjected to a high-voltage electrostatic dry coating-spray process and applied onto a carbon-coated copper current collector. Afterwards, the electrodes were calendered at high temperature with a determined applied force.\n Our objective was to characterize the mixing quality in the electrode powder mixtures and explore its correlation with electrode quality. To accomplish this, we employed various methods, including notably Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging and powder resistivity tests conducted via impedance measurements with precise pressure control. Additionally, image analysis tools were utilized to quantify the fraction of binder distributed on the surface of the graphite particles and differentiate it from the binder fraction forming agglomerates. An example of this quantification can be observed in Fig. 1a-b, where a graphite particle covered by PVdF nanoparticles is depicted, showcasing how the image analysis tool accurately distinguishes between both materials. This allowed for a better understanding and rationalization of the influence of PVdF binder distribution on the properties of the electrodes.\n Characterizing the electrodes produced from these powder mixtures was equally important and included a wide range of analyses such as morphology assessment using SEM and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), as well as surface resistivity measurements. Mechanical properties were evaluated through peel strength tests to measure electrode-current collector adhesion force and nanoindentation tests for hardness, elastic modulus, and plasticity. Electrochemical evaluations were conducted focusing on rate capability to determine the delithiation capacity at various delithiation rates, as well as through long-term cycling measurements.\n Our research findings suggest that mixing time, particularly the binder distribution, significantly impacts the morphology, electrical, and electrochemical properties of our electrodes. This exploration enabled us to identify optimal parameters for electrode fabrication, resulting in high-quality electrodes with relatively short production times and favorable electrochemical and mechanical properties. These electrodes exhibit performance comparable to those produced through conventional wet-slurry based methods.\n References: \n \n Y. Lu et al., Matter, 5, 876–898 (2022).\n \n \n M.

        "abstract": "Sodium metal batteries have become one of the most attractive targets for beyond-lithium electrochemical energy storage opportunities in recent years due to their low cost, high abundance, and sustainability when compared to popular lithium systems. The adoption of sodium metal batteries has been limited, however, by their instability and poor cycle life. Current efforts to resolve instability of the sodium metal anode have primarily focused on the adaptation of electrolyte systems (including solvents, salts, and additives) from the more researched lithium metal battery systems with some success.1 However, it has become clear that sodium metal batteries behave distinctly for their alkali counterpart, and will require new electrolyte design strategies. In order to inform solvation shell dynamics and SEI formation, this work explores 2 common salts (NaPF6 and NaTFSI) and 2 common solvents (diglyme and FEC) employed in sodium metal battery electrolytes. The selected components possess a range of desirable molecular structures bulk properties, allowing us to diagram the connections between their solvation structures and bulk solution phase properties. We achieve this by probing solvation shells with (1) Raman and (2) NMR spectroscopy, and following these chemical dynamics through to their impacts on electrolyte decomposition with in operando (3)electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) and SEI composition (4) XPS to morphology (5) SEM. Finally, we correlate these fundamental electrochemical and chemical observations to traditional cycling analysis as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). We elucidate distinct roles of anion and solvent for ion transport and SEI formation in sodium systems, providing crucial understanding required for informed Na electrolyte design. 1.

        "title": "Redox-Targeting Semi-Liquid Electrode with Hard Carbon for High-Energy-Density Seawater Batteries",
        "abstract": "Seawater batteries (SWBs) are emerging as the next generation of energy storage systems owing to their high potential energy densities. However, they suffer from low practical energy densities. Utilizing an open-structured cathode that utilizes the unlimited supply of sodium ions from seawater, SWBs are inherently limited in energy density owing to the capacity of the anode. To maximize the amount of active material in a limited anode space, efforts with highly loaded electrodes present challenges in terms of sufficient reversibility, while liquid electrodes have low capacity, requiring alternative methods. To enhance the energy density of the SWB anode, this study used the “redox targeting” method, which has been used to enhance the energy density in redox flow battery systems. Redox targeting was achieved by combining a hard carbon (HC) active material with a sodium biphenyl (Na-BP) redox mediator in a semi-liquid electrode (SLE) form.\n Na-BP has a potential of approximately 0.09 V compared to sodium, while hard carbon has a reaction potential ranging from 0 V to 2 V. During the manufacturing process, the sodium source and electrons of Na-BP are transferred to hard carbon spontaneously. Morphological analysis of the HC in the synthesised SLE was carried out using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy elemental mapping, which showed that the sodium is uniformly distributed throughout the HC particles. During manufacturing, sodium and electrons were transferred effectively from Na-BP to HC.\n Ex-situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy was used to confirm the structure of the HC of SLE after the charging and discharging process. The d-spacing between the graphite layers in the HC of SLE as-synthesis is approximately 3.7 Å, which is similar to the d-spacing of the pristine HC. However, the d-spacing of the HC after the SLE is fully charged increases to 4.3 Å. Conversely, the d-spacing of the hard carbon in the fully discharged SLE is reduced, similar to its initial as-synthesized state. In general, HC undergoes an intercalation reaction, causing an increase in d-spacing when sodium is stored between the layers of graphite. Sodium is reversibly intercalated and extruded into the HC of the SLE system.\n In a seawater battery half-cell system that uses a sodium ferrocyanide aqueous solution as the cathodic redox material, the electrochemical performance of the SLE during galvanostatic charge-discharge was compared with the theoretical voltage of 3.07 V. When operated at a current density of 10 mA gHC-1 (equivalent to 0.55 mA cm-2), the SLE showed a charging voltage of 3.2 V and a discharging voltage of 2.9 V. The cycling performance of the SLE was evaluated under various states of charge (SOC) at a current density of 20 mA gHC-1. The SLE demonstrated reversibility for 20 cycles with a capacity equivalent to 33.3 mAh cm-2 at an SOC of 100% and 75 cycles with a capacity equivalent to 22.2 mAh cm-2 at an SOC of 66.6%. The Coulombic efficiency was over 92.5%, and the energy efficiency was approximately 80%. Notably, the reversible capacity of 11.1 mAh cm-2 with a SOC of 33.3% was maintained for over 500 cycles, indicating the potential for over 5000 h of operation.\n After evaluating the electrochemical performance of the SWB half-cell system (using the sodium ferrocyanide catholyte), the SLE was applied to a full-cell system of the SWB via the oxygen evolution/reduction reaction (OER/ORR), which utilizes dissolved oxygen from natural seawater. At a current density of 10 mA gHC-1, the HCBP-SLE exhibited a charging voltage ranging from 3 V to 3.6 V and a discharging voltage ranging from 3.2 V to 2.5 V. The electrochemical performance was evaluated at a capacity of 33.3 mAh cm-2, which corresponds to an SOC of 100%, and exceeded 98.2% Coulombic efficiency and approximately 80% energy efficiency over 15 cycles. Therefore, it was confirmed that reversible operation with a high areal capacity is feasible even under natural seawater conditions.\n A semi-liquid electrode was produced utilizing an HC active material and an Na-BP redox mediator and then applied to seawater batteries. The semi-liquid electrode approach utilized a redox mediator to facilitate charge transfer, allowing energy storage in the active solid material. When applied to a SWB half-cell system, reversible operation for 20 cycles at an areal capacity of 33.3 mAh cm-2 and stable operation for more than 500 cycles (5000 h) at an areal capacity of 11.1 mAh cm-2 were demonstrated. These results can be employed to achieve high energy densities not only in seawater batteries but also in other battery systems, such as redox flow batteries or air batteries.\n \n \n \n \n Figure 1\n",

The narrow electrochemical window is the main problem of conventional aqueous electrolyte. Here, an economical room-temperature inorganic hydrated molten salt (RTMS) electrolyte with a large electrochemical stability window of 3.1 V is proposed. Compared with organic fluorinated molten salts, RTMS is composed of lithium nitrate hydrate and sodium nitrate with much lower cost. Based on the RTMS electrolyte, a hybrid Li/Na-ion full battery is fabricated from cobalt hexacyanoferrate cathode (NaCoHCF) and perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) anode. The full cell with the RTMS electrolyte exhibits a fantastic performance with high capacity of 139 mAh g-1 at 1 C, 90 mAh g-1 at 20 C, and capacity retention of 94.7% over 500 cycles at 3 C. The excellent performances are contributed to the unique properties of RTMS with a large electrochemical window, solvated H2 O free and high mobility of Li+ , which exhibits excellent Li-ions insertion and extraction capacity of NaCoHCF.

        "abstract": "Hard carbon is considered one of the most promising anode candidates for sodium ion batteries but suffers from a moderate rate performance. Here, we design microporous carbon nanospheres using a novel hybrid monomer that simultaneously involves an organic moiety and an inorganic moiety as the starting unit. The inorganic moiety forms a continuous network, which serves as a 3D scaffold and a nanometer-scale template, then supports the off-collapse of the carbon skeleton and creates a well-developed microporous structure. In addition, the graphite microcrystal structure can be tailored by adjusting the heating treatment temperatures. The electrochemical study demonstrates that the microporous carbon nanospheres show dominant capacitive sodium storage behavior, thus presenting an outstanding rate performance. Even if a very high current density of 10 A g-1 is applied, the hard carbon anode can deliver a large capacity of 127 mAh g-1 with a considerable plateau capacity of 53 mAh g-1, which has rarely been obtained in previous publications. Besides, the carbon anode has a good cycling stability, and the capacity reached 210 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles with a current density of 1 A g-1, showing no dramatic capacity loss.",

The introduction of Na ions in the electrolyte greatly boosts the conversion of Ca polysulfides, which has been verified by theoretical calculation and experimental investigation.

        "abstract": "Tin oxide (SnO) is considered one of the most promising metal oxides for utilization as anode material in sodium ion batteries (SIBs), because of its ease of synthesis, high specific gravimetric capacity, and satisfactory cycling performance. However, to aim at practical applications, the Coulombic efficiency during cycling needs to be further improved, which requires a deeper knowledge of its working mechanism. Here, a microflower-shaped SnO material is synthesized by means of an ultrafast ionic liquid-assisted microwave method. The as-prepared SnO anode active material exhibits excellent cycling performance, good Coulombic efficiency as well as a large capacity delivered at low potential, which is fundamental to maximize the energy output of SIBs. These overall merits were never reported before for pure SnO anodes (i.e., not in a composite with, for example, graphene). Additionally, by combining ex situ XRD and XPS, it is clearly demonstrated for the first time that the Sn-Na alloy, which is formed during the initial sodium sodiation, desodiates in two successive but fully separated steps. Totally different from the previous report, the pristine SnO phase is not regenerated upon desodiation up to 3 V vs Na/Na+.

The use of small-sized metal or metal compound nanoparticles, completely encapsulated by carbon materials, has attracted significant attention as an effective approach to enhancing sodium ion storage properties.

Furthermore, various sulfidation processes to determine the optimal method for achieving complete encapsulation are investigated by comparing the morphologies of diverse iron sulfide-carbon composites. The fully encapsulated structure, combined with the porous carbon, provides ample space to accommodate the significant volume changes during cycling.

        "abstract": "Abstract Amorphous carbon holds great promise as anode material for sodium‐ion batteries due to its cost‐effectiveness and good performance. However, its sodium storage mechanism, particularly the insertion process and origin of plateau capacity, remains controversial. Here, an extended adsorption/insertion‐filling sodium storage mechanism is proposed using petroleum coke‐derived amorphous carbon as a multi‐microcrystalline model. Combining in situ X‐ray diffraction, in situ Raman, theoretical calculations, and neutron scattering, the effective storage form and location of sodium ions in amorphous carbon are revealed. The sodium adsorption at defect sites leads to a high‐potential sloping capacity. The sodium insertion process occurs in both the pseudo‐graphite phase (d 002 > 0.370 nm) and graphite‐like phase (0.345 ≤ d 002 < 0.370 nm) rather than the graphite phase, contributing to low‐potential sloping capacity. The sodium filling into accessible closed pores forms quasi‐metallic sodium clusters, contributing to plateau capacity. The threshold of the effective interlayer spacing for sodium insertion is extended to 0.345 nm, breaking the consensus of insertion interlayer threshold and enhancing understanding of closed pore filling. The extended adsorption/insertion‐filling mechanism explains the sodium storage behavior of amorphous carbon with different microstructures, providing theoretical guidance for the rational design of high‐performance amorphous carbon anodes.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal chalcogenides especially Fe-based selenides for sodium storage have the advantages of high electric conductivity, low cost, abundant active sites, and high theoretical capacity. Herein, we proposed a facile synthesis of Fe7Se8 embedded in carbon nanofibers (denoted as Fe7Se8-NCFs). The Fe7Se8-NCFs with a 1D electron transfer network can facilitate Na+ transportation to ensure fast reaction kinetics. Moreover, Fe7Se8 encapsulated in carbon nanofibers, Fe7Se8-NCFs, can effectively adapt the volume variation to keep structural integrity during a continuous Na+ insertion and extraction process. As a result, Fe7Se8-NCFs present improved rate performance and remarkable cycling stability for sodium storage. The Fe7Se8-NCFs exhibit practical feasibility with a reasonable specific capacity of 109 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles and a favorable rate capability of 136 mA h g−1 at a high rate of 2 A g−1 when coupled with Na3V2(PO4)3 to assemble full sodium ion batteries.",

        "title": "Highly Reversible Sodium Metal Battery Anodes via Alloying Heterointerfaces.",
        "abstract": "As a promising pathway toward low-cost, long-duration energy storage, rechargeable sodium batteries are of increasing interest. Batteries that incorporate metallic sodium as anode promise a high theoretical specific capacity of 1166 mAh g-1 , and low reduction potential of -2.71 V. The high reactivity and poor electrochemical reversibility of sodium anodes render sodium metal anode (SMA) cells among the most challenging for practical implementation. Here, the failure mechanisms of Na anodes are investigated and the authors report that loss of morphological control is not the fundamental cause of failure. Rather, it is the inherently poor anchoring/root structure of electrodeposited Na to the electrode substrate that leads to poor reversibility and cell failure. Poorly anchored Na deposits are prone to break away from the current collector, producing orphaning and poor anode utilization. Thin metallic coatings in a range of chemistries are proposed and evaluated as SMA substrates. Based on thermodynamic and ion transport considerations, such substrates undergo reversible alloying reactions with Na and are hypothesized to promote good root growth-regardless of the morphology. Among the various options, Au stands out for its ability to support long Na anode lifetime and high reversibility (Coulombic Efficiency > 98%), for coating thicknesses in the range of 10-1000 nm. As a first step toward evaluating practical utility of the anodes, their performance in Na||SPAN cells with N:P ratio close to 1:1 is evaluated.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon, as the most promising commercial anode materials of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), has suffered from the coupling limitations on initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), capacity, and rate capability. Herein, to break such coupling limitations, sulfur-rich nitrogen-doped carbon nanomaterials (S-NC) were synthesized by a synergistic modification strategy, including structure/morphology regulation and dual heteroatom doping. The small specific surface area of S-NC is beneficial for inhibiting excessive growth of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film and irreversible interfacial reaction. The covalent S can serve as active electrochemical sites by Faradaic reactions and provide extra capacity. Benefit by N, S co-doping, S-NC shows large interlayer spacing, high defects, good electronic conductivity, strong ion adsorption performance, and fast Na+ ion transport, which combined with a more significant pore volume result in speedier reaction kinetics. Hence, S-NC possesses a high reversible specific capacity of 464.7 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 with a high ICE of 50.7%, excellent rate capability (209.8 mAh g-1 at 10.0 A g-1), and superb long-cycle capability delivering a capacity of 229.0 mAh g-1 (85% retention) after 1800 cycles at 5.0 A g-1.",

In addition, rapid charge-discharge battery systems require electrolytes with high Na-ion transport properties. Herein, we demonstrate a stable and high-rate sodium-metal battery enabled by a nonaqueous polyelectrolyte solution composed of a weakly coordinating polyanion-type Na salt, poly[(4-styrenesulfonyl)-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide] (poly(NaSTFSI)) copolymerized with butyl acrylate, in a propylene carbonate solution. It was found that this concentrated polyelectrolyte solution exhibited a remarkably high Na-ion transference number (tNaPP = 0.9) and a high ionic conductivity (σ = 1.1 mS cm-1) at 60 °C. Furthermore, the surface of the Na electrode was modified with polyanion chains anchored via the partial decomposition of the electrolyte. The surface-tethered polyanion layer effectively suppressed the subsequent decomposition of the electrolyte, thereby enabling stable Na deposition/dissolution cycling. Finally, an assembled sodium-metal battery with a Na0.44MnO2 cathode demonstrated an outstanding charge/discharge reversibility (Coulombic efficiency >99.8%) over 200 cycles while also exhibiting a high discharge rate (i.e., 45% capacity retention at 10 mA cm-2).",

In the present study, we use first-principles calculations to investigate the performance of 2D Mg2C as anode materials for Li, Na, K and Ca-ions batteries. The calculated average open-circuit voltage are 0.37, 0.50, 0.03 and 0.06 eV vs Li, Na, K, Ca. No significant structural deformations are observed on the 2D Mg2C upon the adsorption of Li, Na, K or Ca and the metallic characteristic of the 2D Mg2C is retained. The metallic behaviour of both pristine and adsorbed Mg2C ensures the desirable electric conductivity, implying the advantages of 2D Mg2C for batteries. The Na and K atoms show an extremely high diffusivity on the 2D Mg2C with a low energy barrier of 0.08 and 0.04 eV respectively, which is about an order of magnitude smaller than that of Li atom. For the Na and K atoms, the theoretical storage capacity can reach up to 1770 mAh g−1, nearly two times that of the Li atom of 885 mAh g−1. Our study suggests that the 2D Mg2C is a promising anode material which offers a fast ion diffusion and high storage capacity.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have attracted worldwide attention as potential alternatives for large scale stationary energy storage due to the rich reserves and low cost of sodium resources. However, the practical application of sodium-ion batteries is restricted by unsatisfying capacity and poor rate capability. Herein, a novel mechanism of improving both interfacial and surface charge transfer is proposed by fabricating a graphene oxide/SnO2/Co3O4 nanocomposite through a simple hydrothermal method. The formation of heterostructures between ultrafine SnO2 and Co3O4 could enhance the charge transfer of interfaces owing to the internal electric field. The pseudocapacitive effect, which is led by the high specific area and the existence of ultrafine nanoparticles, takes on a feature of fast faradaic surface charge-transfer. Benefiting from the synergistic advantages of the heterostructures and the pseudocapacitive effect, the as-prepared graphene oxide/SnO2/Co3O4 anode achieved a high reversible capacity of 461 mA h g-1 after 80 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g-1. Additionally, at a high current density of 1 A g-1, a high reversible capacity of 241 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles is obtained. A full cell coupled by the as-prepared graphene oxide/SnO2/Co3O4 anode and the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode was also constructed, which exhibited a reversible capacity of 310.3 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 1 A g-1.

Here, sulfur-defective vanadium sulfide/carbon fiber composites (D-V5S8/CNFs) are designed and fabricated by a facile electrospinning method, followed by sulfuration treatment. The unique architecture, in which V5S8 nanoparticles are confined inside the carbon fiber, provides a short-range channel and abundant adsorption sites for ion storage. Moreover, enlarged interlayer spacings could also alleviate the volume changes, and offer small vdW interactions and ionic diffusion resistance to store more Na and K ions reversibly and simultaneously. The DFT calculations further demonstrate that sulfur defects can effectively facilitate the adsorption behavior of Na+ and K+ and offer low energy barriers for ion intercalation. Taking advantage of the functional integration of these merits, the D-V5S8/CNF anode exhibits excellent storage performance and long-term cycling stability. It reveals a high capacity of 462 mA h g-1 at a current density of 0.2 A g-1 in SIBs, while it is 350 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 in PIBs, as well as admirable long-term cycling characteristics (190 mA h g-1/17 000 cycles/5 A g-1 for SIBs and 165 mA h g-1/3000 cycles/1 A g-1 for PIBs).

However, it generally suffers from low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), which is closely related to the formation process of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Herein, the impact of different electrolyte salts on the electrochemical performance and SEI formation of a commercial HSAC anode is studied.

Through comprehensive characterizations, the improvement in electrochemical performance facilitated by NaCF3SO3 could be attributed to the reduced amount of NaxC and the thinner SEI formed on the surface of HSAC during the initial cycle, which not only provides extra active sites for Na+ storage but also contributes to the promoted ICE. This work not only provides a deeper understanding of the role of electrolyte salt in SEI formation in the HSAC anode but also proposes a new method to further promote the ICE of the HSAC anode in sodium-ion batteries.",

        "title": "Effect of the Particle-Size Distribution on the Electrochemical Performance of a Red Phosphorus–Carbon Composite Anode for Sodium-Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "Red phosphorus (RP) is a promising candidate as an anode for sodium-ion batteries because of its low potential and high specific capacity. It has two main disadvantages. First, it experiences 490% volumetric expansion during sodiation, which leads to particle pulverization and substantial reduction of the cycle life. Second, it has an extremely low electronic conductivity of 10–14 S cm–1. Both issues can be addressed by ball milling RP with a carbon matrix to form a composite of electronically conductive carbon and small RP particles, less susceptible to pulverization. Through this procedure, however, the resulting particle-size distribution of the RP particles is difficult to determine because of the presence of the carbon particles. Here, we quantify the relationship between the RP particle-size distribution and its cycle life for the first time by separating the ball-milling process into two steps. The RP is first wet-milled to reduce the particle size, and then the particle-size distribution is measured via dynamic light scattering. This is followed by a dry-milling step to produce RP–graphite composites. We found that wet milling breaks apart the largest RP particles in the range of 2–10 μm, decreases the Dv90 from 1.85 to 1.26 μm, and significantly increases the cycle life of the RP. Photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy confirm the successful formation of a carbon coating, with longer milling times leading to more uniform carbon coatings. The RP with a Dv90 of 0.79 μm mixed with graphite for 48 h delivered 1354 mA h g–1 with high coulombic efficiency (>99%) and cyclability (88% capacity retention after 100 cycles). These results are an important step in the development of cyclable, high-capacity anodes for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The stability of aqueous Z inc (Zn) ion energy storage devices is significantly compromised by the instability at the electrode/electrolyte interface, which can result in the growth of Zn dendrites, self‐corrosion, and various other side reactions. Regulating the Zn‐ion （Zn2+) solvation structure through electrolyte additives has been proved to be effective strategy in stabilizing the Zn anode, but the influence of free water on the solvation structure is often lacking in‐depth exploration. Herein, the piperazine‐N,N‐bis(2‐hydroxypropanesulfonic acid) sodium salt (POPSO‐Na) is presented as a multifunctional electrolyte additive, which enhances the stability of the Zn anode by modulating the deposition and stripping environment of Zn2⁺ and limiting the presence of free water in the electrolyte during cycling. Theoretical calculation and experimental results demonstrate that the POPSO‐Na additive can not only replace the structural water around Zn2+ to destroy the original solvation sheath, but also form reverse micelle interface structure to hinder the proton transition and constrain the free water in the electrolyte. Thus, the Zn||Zn battery utilizing the ZnSO4+POPSO‐Na electrolyte exhibits an impressive cycle life of 1600 h at a current density of 1 mA cm−2, achieving an average Coulomb efficiency (CE) of ≈100%, which is significantly better than that observed with the ZnSO4 electrolyte. Moreover, the Zn||Cu battery with ZnSO4+POPSO‐Na electrolyte achieves high stability even after cycling for over 2000 h.",

The anatase TiO2 electrode material with insertion/extraction mechanism shows stable cycling performance, which is more in line with the technical requirements of large-scale energy storage batteries. To improve the electrical conductivity and stability of the TiO2 electrode materials, we have synthesized anatase TiO2 and CMK-3 composite.

        "abstract": "As novel \"post lithium-ion batteries\" and promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) suffering from the limited Li resources, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are nowadays emerging and show bright prospects in large-scale energy storage applications due to abundant Na resources. However, a lack of suitable anode materials has become a key obstacle for the development of SIBs. Here we explore the potential of the two-dimensional (2D) Y-C space and identify a novel anode material for SIBs, a new Y4C3 sheet with P3̄m1 crystal symmetry, by means of first-principles swarm structure calculations. This Y4C3P3̄m1 structure has rather good kinetic and thermodynamic stability, possesses intrinsic metallicity, and remains metallic after adsorbing Na atoms, ensuring good electrical conductivity during the SIB cycle. Remarkably, a Y4C3 sheet as an anode for SIBs possesses the essential properties of a high specific capacity (∼752 mA h g-1), a low barrier energy (∼0.1 eV), and suitable open-circuit voltage (0-0.15 V). These characteristics are comparable and even superior to those of another known 2D Y2C anode material, indicating that the Y4C3 sheet can act as an appealing new candidate as an anode material for SIBs and offering new insights into the 2D Y-C space.",

This accumulation slows down the local sodiation at the \"hot spots\", promotes the uniform sodiation and enhances the electrode stability. Therefore, the electrode maintains a high specific capacity of 565 mAh g-1 after 3000 cycles at 2 A g-1, much better than the case without K+. The electrode also remains an areal capacity of ~3.5 mAh cm-2 after 100 cycles.

        "title": "Developing Tailor-Made Core-Shell Hard Carbon Materials As Anode Materials in Sodium Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "The current strong interest in electromotive mobility and the need to transition to an energy grid with sustainable storage devices has led to a renewed interest in sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Hard carbons (HCs) are promising candidates for high-capacity negative electrode materials in SIBs. Their high capacities, however, are often accompanied with high irreversible capacity losses during the initial cycles.[1]\n Generally, large losses can be connected to irreversible reactions, e.g., the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), during the initial sodiation of the HC-material. However, high irreversible capacity values are often in contradiction to the experimentally determined low surface area of the sample material.[1] A better understanding of the structure-property relationship should enable quantification and understanding of the potential of hard carbon materials for SIBs. Hence, the aim is to use analytical techniques to establish a correlation between the structure and the electrochemical characteristics of HC-materials. This has previously been difficult, in part because the sodium storage mechanism is not stoichiometric and due to the disordered structure of HCs.\n In order to tackle the aforementioned challenges, our approach is to explore whether a core-shell structure can separate sodium storage and solid electrolyte interphase formation. Thus, storage capacity and irreversible losses could be investigated and finally optimized separately. The synthesis of a selection of porous carbon structures serving as the core material, will be attempted. Simultaneously, sodium-conducting shell structures will be developed to allow for separation of sodium ions and electrolyte molecules. Subsequently, the combination of core and shell materials will be undertaken. These anodes should enable high capacities accompanied with low irreversible losses due to optimized SEI-formation.\n Literature:\n [1] Matsukawa, Y.; Linsenmann, F.; Plass, M.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are promising alternatives to replace lithium-ion batteries as future energy storage batteries because of their abundant sodium resources, low cost, and high charging efficiency. In order to match the high energy capacity and density, designing an atomically doped carbonous material as the anode is presently one of the important strategies to commercialize SIBs. In this work, we report the preparation of high-performance dual-atom-doped carbon (C) materials using low-cost corn starch and thiourea (CH4N2S) as the precursors. The electronegativity and radii of the doped atoms and C are different, which can vary the embedding properties of sodium ions (Na+) into/on C. As sulfur (S) can effectively expand the layer spacing, it provides more channels for embedding and de-embedding Na+. The synergistic effect of N and S co-doping can remarkably boost the performance of SIBs. The capacity is preserved at 400 mAh g −1 after 200 cycles at 500 mA g−1; more notably, the initial Coulombic efficiency is 81%. Even at a high rate of high current of 10 A g−1, the cell capacity can still reach 170 mAh g−1. More importantly, after 3000 cycles at 1 A g−1, the capacity decay is less than 0.003% per cycle, which demonstrates its excellent electrochemical performance. These results indicate that high-performance carbon materials can be prepared using low-cost corn starch and thiourea.",

Thanks to the ether-based electrolyte, the MoS2 @NSC shows a unique capacity growth in the original stage of cycling. But in the ester-based electrolyte, MoS2 @NSC shows a usual capacity decay.

However, the micron-sized FeS2 usually suffers from poor cyclability, which stems from structure collapse, exfoliation of active materials, and sulfur dissolution. Here, we use a synergistic approach to enhance the sodium storage performance of the micron-sized FeS2 through voltage control (0.5-3 V), binder choice, and graphene coating. The FeS2 electrode with the synergistic approach exhibits high specific capacity (524 mA h g-1), long cycle life (87.8% capacity retention after 800 cycles), and excellent rate capability (323 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1). The results prove that a synergistic approach can be applied in the micron-sized sulfides to achieve high electrochemical performance.",

        "title": "Improving the Electrochemical Property of Silicon Anodes through Hydrogen-Bonding Cross-Linked Thiourea-Based Polymeric Binders.",
        "abstract": "Binders play a crucial role in the development of silicon (Si) anodes for lithium-ion batteries with high specific energy. The large volume change of Si (∼300%) during repeated discharge and charge processes causes the destruction and separation of electrode materials from the copper (Cu) current collector and ultimately results in poor cycling performance. In the present study, we design and prepare hydrogen-bonding cross-linked thiourea-based polymeric binders (denoted CMC-co-SN) in consideration of their excellent binding interaction with the Cu current collector and low cost as well. The CMC-co-SN binders are formed through in situ thermopolymerization of chain-type carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC) with thiourea (SN) in the drying process of Si electrode disks. A tight and physical interlocked layer between the CMC-co-SN binder and Cu current collector is derived from a dendritic nonstoichiometric copper sulfide (CuxS) layer on the interface and enhances the binding of electrode materials with the Cu current collector. When applying the CMC-co-SN binders to micro- (∼3 μm) (μSi) and nano- (∼50 nm) (nSi) Si particles, the Si anodes exhibit high initial Coulomb efficiency (91.5% for μSi and 83.2% for nSi) and excellent cyclability (1121 mA h g-1 for μSi after 140 cycles and 1083 mA h g-1 for nSi after 300 cycles). The results demonstrate that the CMC-co-SN binders together with a physical interlocked layer have significantly improved the electrochemical performance of Si anodes through strong binding forces with the current collector to maintain electrode integrity and avoid electric contact loss.",

        "abstract": "Manganese-based chalcogenides would be of latent capacity in serving as anodes for assembling lithium- and/or sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs) due to their large theoretical capacity, low price, and low-toxicity functionality, while the low electroconductivity and easy agglomeration behavior may impede their technical applications. Here, a solid-state solution of MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes in rock-salt phase has been synthesized for the first time at a relatively low temperature from the precursors of Mn(II) acetylacetonate with dibenzyl dichalcogens in oleylamine with octadecene, and the MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes have been assembled with N-doped graphene to form a new kind of heterostructured nanohybrids (shortened as MnS0.5Se0.5/N-G hybrids), which are very potential for the fabrication of metal-ion batteries including LIBs and/or SIBs. Investigations revealed that there have been dense vacancies generated and active sites increased via nonequilibrium alloying of MnS and MnSe into the solid-solution MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes with segregation and defects achieved in the low-temperature solution synthetic route. Meanwhile, the introduction of N-doped graphene forming heterojunction interfaces between MnS0.5Se0.5 and N-doped graphene would efficiently enhance their electroconductivity and avoid agglomeration of the active MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes with considerably improved electrochemical properties. As a result, the MnS0.5Se0.5/N-G hybrids delivered superior Li/Na storage capacities with outstanding rate performance as well as satisfactorily lasting stability (1039/457 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 for LIBs/SIBs). Additionally, full-cell LIBs of the anodic MnS0.5Se0.5/N-G constructed with cathodic LiFePO4 (LFP) further confirmed the promising future for their practical application.",

        "abstract": "MXenes are mentioned in many applications due to their unique properties. However, the traditional etching method has a lengthy synthesis time, dangerous process, and high cost. Molten salt etching is not only short in time but also safe and simple, laying a good foundation for industrialization. Here, we compare the traditional F‐containing etching method with the molten salt etching method. Transmission electron microscopy elemental mapping images and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy show that the Ti3C2Tx surface end of traditional etching is terminated by –F, while the Ti3C2Tx surface end of molten salt etching is terminated by –Cl. Finally, the sodium‐ion batteries are fabricated and the performance difference of the three etching methods is compared. The results show that the capacity of 102.1 mAh g–1 can still be reached when the molten salt etching MXene material returns to 0.1 A g–1 after the current density of 5 A g–1. After 500 cycles at 1 A g–1, there is no significant loss of capacity and the Coulomb efficiency is close to 100%.

        "abstract": "The poor reversibility of the zinc (Zn) anodes and the irreversible deposition/dissolution of Mn2+/MnO2 significantly impede the commercialization of Zn–Mn aqueous batteries (ZMABs). In reducing the difference between the desired interfacial reaction environments of the cathode and anode, we found that they face the same problem of interference-the generation of irreversible corrosion products. Herein, we have introduced a novel self-regulatory mechanism. This mechanism involves the addition of sodium dihydrogen phosphate, which shifts from passive protection to active regulation. It effectively captures OH− ions, prevents corrosion product formation, and facilitates the in situ generation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film. This modification also homogenizes Zn ion flow and improves the reversibility of Zn plating and stripping. Furthermore, a stable and slightly acidic environment has been established to stabilize the pH at the cathodic interface, mitigate corrosion product formation, and enhance the reversible deposition and dissolution of Mn2+/MnO2. With the optimal electrolyte, Zn‖Zn symmetric cells demonstrate stable operation for over 3000 hours at 1 mA cm−2, 1 mA h cm−2. Additionally, the Zn‖Cu cells maintain high reversibility after 1000 cycles, achieving an average coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.76%. The assembled Zn‖MnO2 full cells exhibit exceptional cycling stability and rate performance. This work adopts the approach of seeking common ground and emphasizing the balance of cathode and anode interfacial requirements, which represents a new and significant insight for design of ZMABs with high reversibility and high cyclability.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) have attracted much attention due to integrating the high energy density of battery and high out power of supercapacitors. However, rapid Na+ diffusion kinetics in cathode is counterbalanced with sluggish anode, hindering the further advancement and commercialization of SIHCs. Here, aiming at conversion-type metal sulfide anode, taking typical VS2 as an example, a comprehensive regulation of nanostructure and electronic properties through NH4 + pre-intercalation and Mo-doping VS2 (Mo-NVS2 ) is reported. It is demonstrated that NH4 + pre-intercalation can enlarge the interplanar spacing and Mo-doping can induce interlayer defects and sulfur vacancies that are favorable to construct new ion transport channels, thus resulting in significantly enhanced Na+ diffusion kinetics and pseudocapacitance. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that the introduction of NH4 + and Mo-doping enhances the electronic conductivity, lowers the diffusion energy barrier of Na+ , and produces stronger d-p hybridization to promote conversion kinetics of Na+ intercalation intermediates. Consequently, Mo-NVS2 delivers a record-high reversible capacity of 453 mAh g-1 at 3 A g-1 and an ultra-stable cycle life of over 20 000 cycles. The assembled SIHCs achieve impressive energy density/power density of 98 Wh kg-1 /11.84 kW kg-1 , ultralong cycling life of over 15000 cycles, and very low self-discharge rate (0.84 mV h-1 ).",

On charge, the supercapacitor removes salt in a flowing saltwater electrolyte through Cl- electrochemical adsorption at the cathode and Na+ intercalation at the anode. Discharge delivers useful electric energy and regenerates the electrodes. This supercapacitor can be used not only for energy storage with promising electrochemical performance (i.e., high power, high efficiency, and long cycle life), but also as a desalination device with desalination capacity of 146.8 mg g-1 , much higher than most reported capacitive and battery desalination devices.

        "abstract": "Metal phosphides exhibit high energy densities as hosts for lithium/sodium storage owing to their conversion reaction mechanism. Nevertheless, they typically suffer from inferior reversibility and cyclability because of the dissolution of polyphosphides and sluggish electrochemical kinetics. Herein, a series of dual‐bond confined MXene‐MxPy‐G composites have been fabricated, in which MxPy nanoparticles are strongly bound with MXene and graphene nanosheets via Ti─P and C‐P bonds. On one hand, the dual‐bond confinement offers strong adsorption to trap polyphosphides, greatly stabilizing the conversion‐formed products during cycling. On the other hand, dual‐bond immobilization largely promotes electron transfer and ion diffusion, facilitating the reversibility of conversion reactions. As anticipated, these MXene‐MxPy‐G hybrids demonstrate superb lithium/sodium‐storage performance. Particularly, as an anode for lithium‐ion batteries, the MXene‐Sn4P3‐G delivers a high initial coulombic efficiency of 90.1% and a high reversible capacity of 1058.6 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1. Even tested at high rates of 1.0/2.0 A g−1, it can still maintain high reversible capacities of 820.6/726.5 mAh g−1 after 1450 cycles. When applied in pouch full‐cells and sodium‐ion batteries, it also shows extended cyclic lifespans of 350 and 1200 cycles.

Herein, a novel energy storage material based on cobalt metaphosphate nanosheet arrays self-supported on carbon cloths [Co(PO3)2 NSs/CC] is fabricated by a two-step strategy. This rationally designed strategy avoids the preparation of the complex {Co[O2P(OtBu)2]2}n precursor, which significantly simplifies the synthesis process. The active CC acts not only as an electrically conductive substrate as usual but also as a functional basis to suppress PH3-involved reaction and to promote HPO3-involved reaction during the phosphating process, contributing to the formation of Co(PO3)2. The mutual cross-linked porous Co(PO3)2 nanosheets vertically grow on the surface of activated CC, ensuring sufficient electrolyte infiltration and fast electron transport among the electrodes. Sodium ion storage analysis for the Co(PO3)2 NSs/CC electrode reveals a multi-step reaction mechanism with high reversibility, as reflected by the high reversible capacity (667 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1) and excellent cyclability (with almost no capacity decay over 500 cycles).

The a-TiO2-x /r-TiO2-x shows excellent long cycling stability (134 mAh g-1 at 10 C after 4500 cycles) and superior rate performance (93 mAh g-1 after 4500 cycles at 20 C) for sodium-ion batteries.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (NaIBs) are increasingly being envisioned for grid-scale energy storage systems because of cost advantages. However, implementation of this vision has been challenged by the low energy densities delivered by most NaIB cathodes. Toward addressing this challenge, the authors report the synthesis and characterization of a new iron-doped Na3Fe0.3V1.7O(PO4)2F2 cathode using a novel facile hydrothermal route. The synthesized material was characterized using x ray diffraction, Mössbauer spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy techniques. Obtained discharge capacity in half-cell configuration lies from 119 to 125 to 130 mAh/g at C/10 while tested using three different electrolyte formulations, DMC-EC-PC, DEC-EC, and EC-PC, respectively. The synthesized cathodes were also evaluated in full-cell configurations, which delivered an initial discharge capacity of 80 mAh/g with NaTi2(PO4)3MWCNT as the anode. Ionic diffusivity and interfacial charge transfer kinetics were also evaluated as a function of temperature and sodium concentration, which revealed that electrochemical rate performances in this material were limited by charge transfer kinetics. To understand the heat generation mechanism of the Na/Na3Fe0.3V1.7O(PO4)2F2 half-cell during charge and discharge processes, an electrochemical isothermal calorimetry measurement was carried out at different current rates for two different temperatures (25 and 45°C). The results showed that the amount of heat generated was strongly affected by the operating charge/discharge state, C-rate, and temperature. Overall, this work provides a new synthesis route for the development of iron-doped Na3Fe0.3V1.7O(PO4)2F2-based high-performance sodium cathode material aimed at providing a viable pathway for the development and deployment of large-scale energy storage based on sodium battery systems.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) has been widely adopted as the anode material for sodium ion batteries (NIBs). However, it is troubled by a low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) due to its porous structure. Herein, a graphitized and ultrathin carbon layer coating on HC is proposed to solve this challenge. The as-prepared porous carbon material coated with an ultrathin carbon layer composite (PCS@V@C) exhibits a cavity structure, which is prepared by using bis(cyclopentadienyl) nickel (CP-Ni) as the carbon source for outer coating, glucose carbon spheres as porous carbon, and introducing a silica layer to facilitate the coating process. When utilized as the anode for NIBs, the material shows an ICE increase from 47.1% to 85.3%, and specific capacity enhancement at 0.1 A g-1 from 155.3 to 216.7 mA h g-1. Moreover, its rate capability and cycling performance are outstanding, demonstrating a capacity of 140.3 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1, and a retaining capacity of 225.6 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 with the Coulombic efficiency of 100% at the second cycle. The excellent electrochemical performance of the PCS@V@C is attributed to the ultrathin carbon layer, which is beneficial for the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film. Therefore, this study provides a feasible surface modification method for the preparation of anode materials for NIBs with high specific capacity and ICE.",

Still, major drawbacks for the commercial application of SIBs lie in the slow kinetic processes and poor cycling performance of the devices. In this work, a hybrid nanocomposite of Sb2O3 nanoparticles anchored on N-doped graphene nanoribbons (GNR) is implemented as anode material in SIBs. The obtained Sb2O3/N-GNR anode delivers a reversible specific capacity of 642 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 and exhibits a good rate capability. Even after 500 cycles at 5 A g−1, the specific capacity is maintained at about 405 mA h g−1. Such good Na storage performance is mainly ascribed to the beneficial effect of N doping for charge transfer and to the improved microstructure that facilitates the Na+ diffusion through the overall electrode.",

        "title": "(Invited) Design Strategy of High-Performance Hard Carbon Anodes for Sodium-Ion Storage",
        "abstract": "The advancement of hard carbon anodes with high sodium plateau capacities (SPCs) is currently hindered by a paucity of clear materials design principles. Although the pore volume ratio of hard carbon defines the thermodynamic constraints on the theoretical sodium plateau capacities (T-SPCs), exclusive reliance on pore architecture falls short in predicting viable SPCs. In response, our research explores a pivotal kinetic parameter of hard carbons that influences the coefficient of capacity utilization (CCU) of SPCs. We employ a suite of polymeric hard carbons (PHCs) with varied microstructures to achieve our research objectives. Our systematic investigation reveals a pronounced correlation between the intensity ratio of the 2D to G band (I\n 2D\n /I\n G\n ) in the Raman spectrum and the internal kinetic barrier impeding sodium-ion migration. Leveraging these insights, and by considering both thermodynamic and kinetic facets, we introduce a novel structural gauge – the SPC factor – which serves to quantify the CCU for SPCs. This SPC factor identifies an optimal hard carbon anode configuration that combines a high closed pore volume ratio with a minimized I\n 2D\n /I\n G\n ratio. By implementing straightforward microstructural modifications to the PHCs guided by our proposed criteria, we have realized significant achievements. Notably, we have attained an SPC of approximately 400 mA h g-1, underscoring the practicality and impact of our strategy in engineering superior hard carbon anodes for sodium-ion batteries. This investigation constitutes a meaningful leap forward, providing a strategic direction for materials design aimed at augmented SPCs and fostering the progression of future sodium-ion battery technologies.",

        "abstract": "Anode-free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) are regarded as the \"ceiling\" for current sodium-based batteries. However, their practical application is hindered by the unstable electrolyte and interfacial chemistry at the high-voltage cathode and anode-free side, especially under extreme temperature conditions. Here, an advanced electrolyte design strategy based on electrolyte solvation engineering is presented, which shapes a weakly solvating anion-stabilized (WSAS) electrolyte by balancing the interaction between the Na+-solvent and Na+-anion. The special interaction constructs rich contact ion pairs (CIPs) /aggregates (AGGs) clusters at the electrode/electrolyte interface during the dynamic solvation process which facilitates the formation of a uniform and stable interfacial layer, enabling highly stable cycling of 4.0 V-class layered oxide cathode from -40 °C to 60 °C and excellent reversibility of Na plating/stripping with an ultrahigh average CE of 99.89%. Ultimately, industrial multi-layer anode-free pouch cells using the WSAS electrolyte achieve 80% capacity remaining after 50 cycles and even deliver 74.3% capacity at -30 °C.

The metallic feature of the BGe monolayer can be maintained after absorbing different numbers of Na atoms, ensuring good electronic conductivity during the charge/discharge process. The calculated migration energy barrier, open-circuit voltage, and theoretical specific capacity of the BGe monolayer are much better than those of some other two-dimensional (2D) materials. These findings render the BGe monolayer a potential candidate for reversible Na-ion battery anode materials with desirable performance.",

        "abstract": "Soft carbons have attracted extensive interests as competitive anodes for fast-charging sodium-ion batteries (SIBs); however, the high-rate performance is still restricted by their large ion migration barriers and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, we show a molecular design approach toward the fabrication of nitrogen and phosphorus codoped mesoporous soft carbon (NPSC). The key to this strategy lies in the chemical cross-linking reaction between polyphosphoric acid and p-phenylenediamine, associated with pyrolysis induced in-situ self-activation that creates mesoporous structures and rich heteroatoms within the carbon matrix. Thanks to the enlarged interlayer spacing, reduced ion diffusion length, and plentiful active sites, the obtained NPSC delivers a superb rate capacity of 215 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1 and an ultralong cycle life of 4,700 cycles at 5 A g−1. Remarkably, the full cell shows 99% capacity retention during 100 continuous cycles, and maximum energy and power densities of 191 Wh kg−1 and 9.2 kW kg−1, respectively. We believe that such a synthetic protocol could pave a novel venue to develop soft carbons with unique properties for advanced SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, great attention is being directed towards the development of promising electrode materials for non-lithium rechargeable batteries such as sodium and calcium ion batteries (SIBs and CIBs), due to their large abundance, storage capacity and charge/discharge rate. Using density functional theory (DFT) based computations we have predicted that the recently synthesized bilayer s-tetrazine based covalent organic framework (bilayer TZACOF) may be a promising anode material for sodium and calcium ion batteries. The electronic band structure calculations suggest that the bilayer TZACOF is an indirect band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 0.95 eV. The sodium and calcium atoms are adsorbed on the bilayer TZACOF at the most energetically favorable adsorption sites with adsorption energies of -1.37 eV and -2.27 eV, respectively. Moreover, the diffusion energy barriers for the migration of sodium and calcium atoms on the bilayer TZACOF are 0.19 eV and 0.63 eV, respectively, which indicates the fast ion mobility and charge/discharge rate. The theoretical specific capacity (TSC) of the bilayer TZACOF as the electrode material for SIBs and CIBs is 618.69 and 412.46 mA h g-1, respectively. Furthermore, the average voltage of the bilayer TZACOF as the electrode material for SIBs and CIBs is found to be 0.96 and 1.13 V, respectively. Based on the results of rich electronic properties, low diffusion barriers, high storage capacity, and low average voltage, we can reach at the conclusion that the bilayer TZACOF may be a suitable candidate for use as an anode material for sodium and calcium ion batteries (SIBs and CIBs).",

        "abstract": "In recent years, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted a lot of attention and are considered an ideal alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The hard carbon (HC) anode in SIBs presents a unique challenge for studying the formation process of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during initial cycling, owing to its distinctive porous structure. This study employs a combination of ultrasonic scanning techniques and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry to conduct an in-depth analysis of the two-dimensional distribution and composition of gases during the formation process. The findings reveal distinct gas evolution behaviors in SIBs compared to LIBs during formation. Notably, significant gas evolution is observed during the discharge phase of the formation cycle in SIBs, with higher discharge rates leading to increased gas evolution rates. This phenomenon is likely attributed to the adsorption of CO2 gas by the abundant pores in HC, followed by desorption during discharge. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the addition of 5A molecular sieves, which competitively adsorb gases, effectively reduces gas adsorption on the anode during formation, thereby significantly enhancing battery performance. This research elucidates the gas adsorption and desorption behavior at the battery interface, providing new insights into the SEI formation process in SIBs.",

        "abstract": "\n Anode materials based on hard carbon are the focus of research in the field of batteries, and bio-hard carbon is one of the most important materials. In this study, we use the invasive species Spartina alterniflora as raw material and doped with nano graphite to produce high-performance anode materials. It can achieve a first coulomb efficiency of 67%, which is nearly 10% higher than Spartina alterniflora without nano-graphite doped. The specific capacity is close to 300 mAh g−1 under the current of 20 mA g−1. Through comparison, it is found that the modified Spartina alterniflora has great sodium storage capacity, and the study also proved that Spartina alterniflora material can be modified to become a high-performance anode material with high economic value.",

However, the progress of mechanically robust anode materials with high electrochemical properties is still unsatisfactory for the flexible electrodes. Herein, the comprehensive design of the morphology with unique multi-channel hollow 1D/1D carbon nanotube/carbon nanofiber network and the lattice structure of carbon with S/N co-doping has been proposed. Benefiting from the enlarged interlayer spacing and the flexible fibrous network, the S/N doped carbon nanotube/carbon nanofiber composites (CNT/SNCF) possess not only high conductivity but also good structural stability during sodiation and potassiation processes. When used as anode materials in SIBs and PIBs, the free-standing CNT/SNCF electrodes exhibit high discharge capacities (274.1 and 212.5 mA h g-1 at 1 A/g after 1000 cycles, respectively), superior cycle stability (150.4 and 100.1 mA h g-1 at 5 A/g after 5000 cycles, respectively) and rate performance (109.3 mA h g-1 at 10 A/g and 108.7 mA h g-1 at 5 A/g, respectively), showing great prospects in flexible energy storage devices.",

One of the main challenges for sodium-ion batteries, however, is the poor electrolyte stability, which leads to rapid capacity fade during cycling. Recent advances in the lithium-ion-battery field have expanded our understanding of electrolyte compositions and stability, paving the way for better sodium-ion-battery electrolytes. Two of the most promising new classes of electrolytes are evaluated herein with a sodium layered-oxide cathode, for the first time: a localized high-concentration electrolyte (LHCE) composed of sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide, dimethyl ether, and tetrafluoropropyl ether and a \"highly fluorinated\" electrolyte (HFE) composed of 20% fluoroethylene carbonate with a lithium difluorophosphate additive. With a combination of electrochemical and post-mortem characterization techniques, the stability of each electrolyte is assessed with the O3-type Na(Ni0.3Fe0.4Mn0.3)O2 cathode and sodium metal anode. Both electrolytes significantly improve the surface and bulk stability of the cathode, but only the LHCE has a meaningful improvement on sodium metal stability. For the purpose of developing a long-lasting, sodium-ion full cell, both classes of electrolyte show great promise.",

        "abstract": "In recent times, few-layer black phosphorus (BP) has attracted tremendous attention as a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries due to its particular two-dimensional structure, good electron conductivity, and high theoretical capacity. The main disadvantages of BP-based materials are the lower practical specific capacity of the BP-based composite than expectation because of the low P atom utilization and the structural fracture due to the large volume expansion that occurs during sodiation/desodiation cycles. In this work, we report a ternary composite comprising BP, graphite, and polyaniline (BP-G/PANI) with a BP mass content of ∼65 wt %. The ternary composite provides an optimized ion pathway (electrolyte → PANI → BP-G → BP), which reduces the charge transfer resistance of the electrode. Also, further ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that the presence of graphite in the BP-G composite allows a deep sodiation of BP and also leads to a higher sodiation/desodiation reversibility. In addition, the uniformly coated PANI also restricts the huge volume expansion of the BP electrode through discharge/charge processes, which promise the stable cycling performance of BP-G/PANI. Thus, our composite shows a high reversible gravimetric capacity of 1530 mAh gcompo.-1 at 0.25 A g-1 and a capacity retention of 520 mAh gcompo.-1 after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 4 A g-1.",

However, the limited electronic conductivity and significant volume expansion have impeded their further advancement. In this work, we propose a rational design of cube‐like CoP @C composites with unique core‐shell structure via in situ phosphating and subsequent carbon coating processes. The uniform carbon coating serves as a physical buffering layer that effectively mitigates volume changes during charge/discharge processes, and prevents particle agglomeration and fragmentation, thereby enhancing the structural stability of electrode. Moreover, the nitrogen‐rich carbon layer not only provides additional active sites for sodium ion adsorption but also improves the electrode conductivity and accelerates charge transport dynamics. Consequently, the as‐synthesized CoP@C exhibits a remarkable capacity retention rate of 94.8% after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g‐1 and achieves a high reversible capacity of 146.7 mAh g‐1 even under a high current density of 4.0 A g‐1.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) offer several advantages over traditional lithium-ion batteries, including a more uniform sodium distribution, lower-cost materials, and safer transportation options. A promising development in SIBs is the use of hard carbons as anode materials due to their low insertion voltage and larger interlayer spacing, which improve sodium-ion insertion. Traditionally, hard carbons are made from costly carbon sources, but recent advancements have focussed on using abundant bio-waste, like coffee grounds. This approach reduces costs and helps manage global waste. This research investigates the electrochemical performance of bio-waste-derived hard carbons, which is significantly impacted by various pre-treatment methods. Techniques such as BET, XRD, TEM, and XPS are employed to examine the effects of pre-treatment variables, including washing solvents (organic, acidic, or distilled water), pre-oxidation temperatures, and post-heating processes. These factors influence the structural properties and purity of the hard carbon, impacting its effectiveness as an anode material in SIBs. A significant finding is a mesoporous hard carbon produced from coffee grounds that, after washing with distilled water, pre-oxidation at 150 °C, and thermal treatment at 1300 °C in argon, shows a 23% yield, a reversible capacity of 304 mA h g−1, and Initial coulombic efficiency of 78%.

ALD is known to improve the cycling performance, Coulombic efficiency of batteries, and maintain electrode integrity. Here, the electrochemical performance of uncoated P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 electrodes is compared to that of ALD-coated Al2O3 P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 electrodes. Given that ALD coatings are in the early stage of development for NIB cathode materials, little is known about how ALD coatings, in particular aluminum oxide (Al2O3), affect the electrode-electrolyte interface. Therefore, full characterizations of its effects are presented in this work. For the first time, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to elucidate the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on ALD-coated electrodes. It contains less carbonate species and more inorganic species, which allows for fast Na kinetics, resulting in significant increase in Coulombic efficiency and decrease in cathode impedance. The effectiveness of Al2O3 ALD coating is also surprisingly reflected in the enhanced mechanical stability of the particle which prevents particle exfoliation.",

These COFs feature two-dimensional crystalline structures, high porosity, good conductivity, and densely packed redox-active sites, making them suitable for energy storage devices. Among them, FPDC-TPT-COF demonstrates a remarkably high specific capacity of 420 mAh g-1 (0.2 A g-1), excellent cycling stability (~87% capacity retention after 3000 cycles, 1.0 A g-1) and high rate performance (339 mAh g-1 at 2.0 A g-1) as an anode for SIBs, surpassing most reported COF-based electrodes. The superior performance is attributed to the dithiole moieties enhancing the conductivity and the presence of redox-active carbonyl, imine, and triazine sites facilitating Na storage.

        "abstract": "The Fe‐based anode of sodium‐ion batteries attracts much attention due to the abundant source, low‐cost, and high specific capacity. However, the low electron and ion transfer rate, poor structural stability, and shuttle effect of NaS2 intermediate restrain its further development. Herein, the Fe3O4/Fe/FeS tri‐heterojunction node spawned N‐carbon nanotube scaffold structure (FHNCS) was designed using the modified MIL‐88B(Fe) as a template followed by catalytic growth and sulfidation process. During catalytic growth process, the reduced Fe monomers catalyze the growth of N‐doped carbon nanotubes to connect the Fe3O4/Fe/FeS tri‐heterojunction node, forming a 3D scaffold structure. Wherein the N‐doped carbon promotes the transfer of electrons between Fe3O4/Fe/FeS particles, and the tri‐heterojunction facilitates the diffusion of electrons at the interface, to organize a 3D conductive network. The unique scaffold structure provides more active sites and shortens the Na+ diffusion path. Meanwhile, the structure exhibits excellent mechanical stability to alleviate the volume expansion during circulation. Furthermore, the Fe in Fe3O4/Fe heterojunction can adjust the d‐band center of Fe in Fe3O4 to enhance the adsorption between Fe3O4 and Na2S intermediate, which restrains the shuttle effect. Therefore, the FHNCS demonstrates a high specific capacity of 436 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, 84.7% and 73.4% of the initial capacities are maintained after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 and 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1. We believe that this strategy gives an inspiration for constructing Fe‐based anode with excellent rate capability and cycling stability.",

        "abstract": "Silicon is a promising candidate for replacing graphite in anodes for advanced Li‐ion batteries due to its high theoretical gravimetric energy density. However, silicon as an active anode material suffers from significant volume changes upon lithiation/delithiation, causing fast capacity fading. The performance of silicon anodes depends on the polymeric binders used, which form well‐bound Si particles matrices that accommodate the strains developed during their repeated lithiation, thus maintaining their integrity.\nHerein, we investigated the effect of thermal treatment on the performance of polyimide P84 as a novel binder for composite Si anodes comprising metallurgical micron‐size silicon particles (80% silicon). The electrochemical behavior of metallurgical silicon‐based anodes heat‐treated to 120°C, 200°C, 300°C, and 400°C was examined in half (vs. Li electrodes) and full (vs. NCM622 cathodes) cells. An optimal performance was obtained after heat treatment at 400°C, related to the very good adhesion of the electrode’s active mass to the current collector, and the ability of the heat‐treated binder to enhance the active mass integrity upon cycling.\nA comparison between optimized anodes developed herein to other Si anodes containing frequently used binders like Sodium Alginate (SA) and Lithium Polyacrylate (LiPAA), demonstrated clear advantages of the heat‐treated Si anodes containing P84.",

        "abstract": "SnSb alloy, which can be used as an anode in a sodium-ion cell, was synthesized following a resource-efficient route at low temperature. This one-pot approach greatly reduces the energy consumption and maximizes the efficient use of raw materials. The reaction of elemental tin and antimony in the ionic liquid (IL) trihexyltetradecylphosphonium chloride ([P66614]Cl) at 200 °C led to a microcrystalline powder of single-phase SnSb within 10 h with very high yield (95%). Liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that the IL remains essentially stable during the reaction. It was recovered almost quantitatively by distilling off the organic solvent used for product separation. Composites of SnSb powder and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were fabricated by a simple ball milling process. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the Na‖SnSb/CNTs cell retains close to 100% of its initial capacity after 50 cycles at a current of 50 mA g−1, which is much better than the Na‖SnSb cell. The greatly increased capacity retainability can be attributed to the conductive network formed by CNTs inside the SnSb/CNTs electrode, providing 3D effective and fast electronic pathways during sodium intercalation and de-intercalation.",

Experimental results showed that the smallest powder sample which is synthesized, average 10 nm, exhibited excellent performances in both kinds of batteries. According to the results, the characteristics of batteries improved as the size of germanium powder decreased consistently. Pure germanium was thoroughly investigated as an anode of metal-ion batteries with regard to its powder size.

        "abstract": "Phosphorus doping is an effective strategy to simultaneously improve the electronic conductivity and regulate the ionic diffusion kinetics of TiO2 being considered as anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). However, efficient phosphorus doping with high concentration in well-crystallized TiO2 nanoparticles is still a big challenge. Herein, we propose a defect-assisted phosphorus doping strategy to selectively engineer the surface structure of TiO2 nanoparticles. The reduced TiO2-x shell layer that is rich of oxygen defects and Ti3+ species precisely triggered high concentration of phosphorus doping (~7.8 at%) and consequently a TiO2@TiO2-x-P core@shell architecture was produced. Comprehensive characterizations and first-principle calculations proved that the surface functionalized TiO2-x-P thin layer endowed the TiO2@TiO2-x-P with substantially enhanced electronic conductivity and accelerated Na ions transportation, resulting in great rate capability (167 mA h g-1 at 10000 mA g-1) and stable cycling (99% after 5000 cycles at 10 A g-1). Combining in/ex situ X-ray diffraction with ex situ electron spin resonance clearly demonstrated the high reversibility and robust mechanical behavior of the TiO2@TiO2-x-P upon long-term cycling. This work provides an interesting and effective strategy for precise heteroatoms doping to improve the electrochemical performance of nanoparticles.",

        "abstract": "Antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries due to its low cost and high theoretical specific capacity. However, poor stability and a complex preparation process limit its large-scale application. Herein, we prepare a binder-free composite electrode composed of amorphous (α-) Sb2S3 and copper antimony sulfide (CuSbS2) through a simple closed-space sublimation (CSS) method. When applied as the anode in sodium-ion batteries, the α-Sb2S3@CuSbS2 electrode exhibits excellent performance with a high discharge capacity of 506.7 mA h g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1 after 50 cycles. The satisfactory electrochemical performance could be ascribed to the α-Sb2S3–CuSbS2 composite structure and binder-free electrode architecture, which not only retain the structural stability of the electrode but also improve the electrical conductivity. Consequently, CSS, as a scalable and environmentally friendly method, can produce a binder-free electrode in just a few minutes, demonstrating its great potential in the industrial production of sodium-ion batteries. This study may open an avenue to preparing binder-free commercial electrodes.",

In this work, we employed differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and ex situ powder X-ray diffraction to study the thermal stability of several types of sodium-ion electrolytes (NaClO4 and NaPF6 solutions in PC, EC, DEC, and their mixtures) and various cathode and anode materials (Na3V2(PO4)3, Na3(VO)2(PO4)2F, β-NaVP2O7, and hard carbon) in combination with electrolytes. The obtained results indicate, first, the satisfactory thermal stability of liquid Na-ion electrolytes, which start to decompose only at 270~300 °C. Second, we observed that charged vanadium-based polyanionic cathodes, which appear to be very stable in the “dry” state, demonstrate an increase in decomposition enthalpy and a shift of the DSC peaks to lower temperatures when in contact with 1 M NaPF6 in the EC:DEC solution. However, the greatest thermal effect from the “electrode–electrolyte” interaction is demonstrated by the anode material: the heat of decomposition of the soaked electrode in the charged state is almost 40% higher than the sum of the decomposition enthalpies of the electrolyte and dry electrode separately.",

However, its practical application is hindered by its low conductivity. In addition, due to the loss of fluorine during synthesis, Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) impurity is often easily generated, resulting in a decrease in actual operating voltage. Herein, a bifunctional carbon network composed of an N-doped carbon layer and carbon bridge is constructed around NVPF particles. Through pyrolysis of polydopamine (PDA), the NVPF particles are covered in situ by an N-doped carbon layer, and the carbon bridge generated by polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is also coated with N-doped carbon. Besides, PTFE also serves as a fluorine supplement to ensure that pure NVPF is obtained. As a result, the bifunctional N-doped carbon network-modified NVPF delivers a high reversible capacity (125.7 mA h g-1 at 0.2 C) and appreciable cycle stability (92.7% at 1 C over 300 cycles, and 89.8% at 10 C over 1500 cycles).

        "abstract": "Nickle sulfides as promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries have attracted tremendous attention owing to their large specific capacity and good electrical conductivity. However, the relative large volume changes during the sodiation/desodiation process usually result in a fast capacity decay, poor cycling stability, and sluggish electrode kinetics which hinder their practical applications. Herein, NiS1.03 porous hollow spheres (NiS1.03 PHSs) and porous NiS1.03 hollow cages (NiS1.03 PHCs) with high yield are designed and selectively fabricated via a simple solvothermal and subsequent annealing approach. The obtained NiS1.03 PHSs display long-term cycling stability (127 mAh g-1 after 6000 cycles at 8 A g-1) and excellent rate performance (605 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 and 175 mAh g-1 at 15 A g-1). NiS1.03 PHCs also show high rate capability and outstanding cycling stability. In addition, the analyses results of in situ and ex situ XRD patterns and HRTEM images reveal the reversible Na-ion conversion mechanism of NiS1.03. It is also worth noting that the NiS1.03 PHSs//FeFe(CN)6 full cell is successfully assembled and exhibits an initial reversible capacity of 460 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1, which further evidence that NiS1.03 is a kind of prospective anode material for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium titanate Na2Ti3O7 (NTO) has superior electrochemical properties as an anode material in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), and Nb or V doping is suggested to enhance the electrode performance. In this work, we carry out systematic first-principles calculations of the structural, electronic and electrochemical properties of NTO and Na2Ti2.75M0.25O7 (M = Nb, V), using supercells to reveal the effect of Nb or V NTO-doping on its anode performance. It is found that Nb doping gives rise to the expansion of cell volume but V doping induces the shrinkage of cell volume due to the larger and smaller ionic radius of the Nb and V ions, respectively, compared to that of the Ti ion. We perform structural optimization of the intermediate phases of Na2+xM3O7 with increasing Na content x from 0 to 2, revealing that the overall relative volume expansion rate is slightly increased by Nb and V doping but remains lower than 3%. Our calculations demonstrate that the electrode potential of NTO is slightly raised and the specific capacity is reduced, but the electronic and ionic conductivities are improved by Nb or V doping. With the revealed understanding and mechanisms, our work will contribute to the search for advanced electrode materials for SIBs.",

The details of electrochemical redox reactions, rate performance and cycled life were investigated using relatively high mass loading electrodes in two- and three-electrode full-cells. It demonstrated that the rate capability of bismuth anodes with high mass loading are not as good as indicated in previous literatures where low mass loading electrodes were used. It also indicated that the resistances causing a faltering rate performance may be connected to a loss in particle contact during desodiation. Efforts were also made to study the different electrochemical processes that occur during early cycles. Less advantageous characteristics of bismuth electrodes are also discussed. For example, several different electrolyte solutions were tested for compatibility with the bismuth system, where only glyme-based solutions seemed to facilitate robust cycling.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have gradually become one of the most promising energy storage techniques in the current era of post-lithium-ion batteries. For anodes, transitional metal selenides (TMSe) based materials are welcomed choices , owing to relatively higher specific capacities and enriched redox active sites. Nevertheless, current bottlenecks are blamed for their poor intrinsic electronic conductivities, and uncontrollable volume expansion during redox reactions. Given that, an interfacial-confined isochronous conversion strategy is proposed, to prepare orthorhombic/cubic biphasic TMSe heterostructure, namely CuSe/Cu3 VSe4 , through using MXene as the precursor, followed by Cu/Se dual anchorage. As-designed biphasic TMSe heterostructure endows unique hierarchical structure, which contains adequate insertion sites and diffusion spacing for Na ions, besides, the surficial pseudocapacitive storage behaviors can be also proceeded like 2D MXene. By further investigation on electronic structure, the theoretical calculations indicate that biphasic CuSe/Cu3 VSe4 anode exhibits well-enhanced properties, with smaller bandgap and thus greatly improves intrinsic poor conductivities. In addition, the dual redox centers can enhance the electrochemical Na ions storage abilities. As a result, the as-designed biphasic TMSe anode can deliver a reversible specific capacity of 576.8 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 , favorable Na affinity, and reduced diffusion barriers. This work discloses a synchronous solution toward demerits in conductivities and lifespan, which is inspiring for TMSe-based anode development in SIBs systems.",

Herein, we synthesized three halogenated carboxylate-based organic anode materials to exploit the impact of halogen atoms (F, Cl, and Br) on the electrochemical performance of carboxylate anodes in NIBs. The fluorinated carboxylate anode, disodium 2, 5-difluoroterephthalate (DFTP-Na), outperforms the other carboxylate anodes with H, Cl, and Br, in terms of high specific capacity (212 mA h g-1), long cycle life (300 cycles), and high rate capability (up to 5 A g-1). As evidenced by the experimental and computational results, the two F atoms in DFTP reduce the solubility, enhance the cyclic stability, and interact with Na+ during the redox reaction, resulting in a high-capacity and stable organic anode material in NIBs. Therefore, this work proves that fluorinating carboxylate compounds is an effective approach to developing high-performance organic anodes for stable and sustainable NIBs.",

        "abstract": "While cost‐effective sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) with crystalline silicon anodes promise high theoretical capacities, they perform poorly because silicon stores sodium ineffectively (capacity <40 mAh g−1). To address this issue, herein an atomic‐order structural‐design tactic is adopted for obtaining unique multilevel gradient‐ordered silicon (MGO‐Si) by simple electrochemical reconstruction. In situ‐formed short‐range‐, medium‐range‐, and long‐range‐ordered structures construct a stable MGO‐Si, which contributes to favorable Na–Si interaction and fast ion diffusion channels. These characteristics afford a high reversible capacity (352.7 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1) and stable cycling performance (95.2% capacity retention after 4000 cycles), exhibiting record values among those reported for pure silicon electrodes. Sodium storage of MGO‐Si involves an adsorption–intercalation mechanism, and a stepwise construction strategy of gradient‐ordered structure further improves the specific capacity (339.5 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1). Reconstructed Si/C composites show a high reversible capacity of 449.5 mAh g−1, significantly better than most carbonaceous anodes. The universality of this design principle is demonstrated for other inert or low‐capacity materials (micro‐Si, SiO2, SiC, graphite, and TiO2), boosting their capacities by 1.5–6 times that of pristine materials, thereby providing new solutions to facilitate sodium storage capability for better‐performing battery designs.",

        "abstract": "Currently, the limited availability of lithium sources is escalating the cost of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Considering the fluctuating economics of LIBs, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have now drawn attention because sodium is an earth-abundant, low-cost element that exhibits similar chemistry to that of LIBs. Despite developments in different anode materials, there still remain several challenges in SIBs, including lighter cell design for SIBs. The presented work designs a facile strategy to prepare nitrogen-doped free-standing pseudo-graphitic nanofibers via electrospinning. A structural and morphological study implies highly disordered graphitic structured nanofibers having diameters of ∼120–170 nm, with a smooth surface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed that nitrogen was successfully doped in carbon nanofibers (CNFs). When served as an anode material for SIBs, the resultant material exhibits excellent sodium-ion storage properties in terms of long-term cycling stability and high rate capability. Notably, a binder-free self-standing CNF without a current collector was used as an anode for SIBs that delivered capacities of 210 and 87 mA h g–1 at 20 and 1600 mA g–1, respectively, retaining a capacity of 177 mA h g–1 when retained at 20 mA g–1. The as-synthesized CNFs demonstrate a long cycle life with a relatively high Columbic efficiency of 98.6% for the 900th cycle, with a stable and excellent rate capacity. The sodium storage mechanisms of the CNFs were examined with various nitrogen concentrations and carbonization temperatures. Furthermore, the diffusion coefficients of the sodium ions based on the electrochemical impedance spectra measurement have been calculated in the range of 10–15–10–12 cm2 s–1, revealing excellent diffusion mobility for Na atoms in the CNFs. This study demonstrates that optimum nitrogen doping and carbonization temperature demonstrated a lower Warburg coefficient and a higher Na-ion diffusion coefficient leads to enhanced stable electrochemical performance. Thus, our study shows that the nitrogen-doped CNFs will have potential for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Electrochemical performance of the layered compound CrPS4 for the usage as anode material in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) was examined and exceptional reversible long-term capacity and capacity retention were found. After 300 cycles, an extraordinary reversible capacity of 687 mAh g-1 at a current rate of 1 A g-1 was achieved, while rate capability tests showed an excellent capacity retention of 100%. Detailed evaluation of the data evidence a change of the electrochemical reaction upon cycling leading to the striking long-term performance. Further investigations targeted the reaction mechanism of the first cycle by applying complementary techniques, i.e., powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), pair distribution function (PDF) analysis, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and 23Na/31P magic-angle-spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The results indicated an unexpectedly complex reaction pathway including formation of several intercalation compounds, depending on the amount of Na inserted at the early discharge states and subsequent conversion to Na2S and strongly disordered metallic Cr at the completely discharged state. While XAS measurements suggest no further presence of intermediates after formation of Na intercalation compounds, several different phases are detected via MAS NMR upon continued discharging. Especially the data obtained from the MAS NMR investigations therefore point toward a very complex reaction pathway. Furthermore, solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation, resulting in the presence of NaF, was observed. After recharging the anode material, no structural long-range order occurred, but short-range order indeed resembled the local environment of the starting material, to a certain extent.",

        "abstract": "MnFe2O4 nanodots (∼3.3 nm) homogeneously dispersed in porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (denoted as MFO@C) were prepared by a feasible electrospinning technique. Meanwhile, MFO@C with the character of flexible free-standing membrane was directly used as binder- and current collector-free anode for sodium-ion batteries, exhibiting high electrochemical performance with high-rate capability (305 mA h g(-1) at 10000 mA g(-1) in comparison of 504 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1)) and ultralong cycling life (ca. 90% capacity retention after 4200 cycles). The Na-storage mechanism was systematically studied, revealing that MnFe2O4 is converted into metallic Mn and Fe after the first discharge (MnFe2O4 + 8Na(+) + 8e(-) → Mn + 2Fe + 4Na2O) and then to MnO and Fe2O3 during the following charge (Mn + 2Fe + 4Na2O → MnO + Fe2O3 + 8Na(+) + 8e(-)). The subsequent cycles occur through reversible redox reactions of MnO + Fe2O3 + 8Na(+) + 8e(-) ↔ Mn + 2Fe + 4Na2O, of which the reduction/oxidation of MnO/Mn takes place at a lower potential than that of Fe2O3/Fe. Furthermore, a soft package sodium-ion full battery with MFO@C anode and Na3V2(PO4)2F3/C cathode was assembled, delivering a stable capacity of ∼400 mA h g(-1) for MFO@C (with 100 cycles at 500 mA g(-1)) and a promising energy density of 77.8 Wh kg(-1) for the whole battery. This is owing to the distinctive structure of very-fine MnFe2O4 nanodots embedded in porous N-doped carbon nanofibers, which effectively improves the utilization rate of active materials, facilitates the transportation of electrons and Na(+) ions, and prevents the particle pulverization/agglomeration upon prolonged cycling.",

The analysis of the composition, structure, and microstructure of the samples reveals the presence of a major hematite phase, which is accompanied by a certain concentration of an oxyhydroxide phase, which can act as a “lithium-reservoir”. By using sodium alginate as a binder, the synthesized anodes display superior electrochemical response, i.e., high specific capacity values and high stability, not only versus Li but also versus a high voltage cathode in a full cell. From these bare materials, clay-supported anodes are further obtained using sepiolite and bentonite natural silicates. The electrochemical performance of such composites is improved, especially for the sepiolite-containing one treated at 400 °C. The thermal treatment at this temperature provides the optimal conditions for a synergic nano-architecture to develop between the clay and the hematite nanoparticles. High capacity values of ~2500 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles at 1 A g−1 and retentions close to 92% are obtained. Moreover, after 450 cycles at 2 A g−1 current rate, this composite electrode displays values as high as ~700 mA h g−1. These results are interpreted taking into account the interactions between the iron oxide nanoparticles and the sepiolite surface through hydrogen bonds. The electrochemical performance is not only dependent on the oxidation state and particle morphology, but the composition is revealed as a key feature.",

        "abstract": "A prime challenge in the development of new battery chemistries is the fundamental understanding of the generation of the electrode–electrolyte interface (EEI) and its evolution upon cycling. Tip‐enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) under an inert gas atmosphere is employed to study the chemical components of the anode/cathode electrolyte interface in a sodium‐ion battery. After the first cycle, TERS reveals that the EEI mostly consists of organic carbonate/dicarbonate, oligoethylene oxides, α,β‐unsaturated vinyl ketones/acetates, and inorganic species ClO4−, ClO3−, and Na2CO3. Whereas after 5× cycling, the EEI composition has evolved to contain long chain monodentate or bridging/bidentate carboxylates and alkoxides. The TERS map reveals the nano‐scale heterogeneity present in the EEI layers and elucidates a multilayered nano‐mosaic coating structure. The sheer volume of Raman signature present in the TERS signal can completely unravel the mysteries regarding the chemical composition and may shed light to the physicochemical behavior of the EEI.",

        "title": "Chemically Stabilized Nasicon-Na1.5V0.5Nb1.5(PO4)3 Anode for Long-Life Sodium-Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as a potential solution for low cost and grid storage applications due to the more abundance of Na precursors compared to their Li analogues. For SIBs, several attractive candidates are available as cathodes such as layered oxides, Prussian blue analogues and polyanionic compounds but for the anodes hard is used as the primary choice for the fabrication of full SIBs.1-3 The NASICON (Natrium Super-Ionic CONductor) framework can be an efficient electrode material for SIBs due to its high structural and thermal stability along with superior sodium ion mobility. Recently, NASICON compounds are widely explored as cathode and solid-state electrolyte for SIBs and largely ignored as anodes due to their low capacity and high voltage. The general molecular formula for NASICON structure is NaxM2(PO4)3, where a maximum of four sodium can accommodate into the structure, which is built by lantern units, consisting of two MO6 and three PO4 corner shared with each other. We have studied the electrochemical (de)intercalation of sodium in empty NASION-Nb2(PO4)3 for the first time and showed its potential application in the anodes for SIBs.4 Nb2(PO4)3 is attracts lot of attention due to its high capacity (150 mAh g-1) and low voltage (1.4 V vs. Na+/Na0) which make it suitable candidate for SIBs anode. However, it suffers from rapid capacity decay due to the structural degradation, which is triggered by a lack of sufficient sodium ions at the Na (1) site (39% capacity retention after 200 cycles).\n To overcome this issue, we introduce extra sodium ions at Na(1) site via V3+ substitution gives the composition of Na1.5V0.5Nb1.5(PO4)3, which can act as the stabilizing agent to hold lantern units together during cycling.6 The Na-filled anode delivers reversible capacity of ~140 mAh g-1 at 1.2 V vs. Na+/Na0 through Nb5+/Nb4+/Nb3+ and V3+/V2+ redox activities, as predicted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and confirmed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Additionally, the Na (de)intercalation mechanism changes from the multiple two-phase reactions (observed in the Nb2(PO4)3) to complete solid-solution formation in the sodium filled anode demonstrates the critical role of Na(1) site in the NASICON framework, in-line with DFT calculations, and enhances sodium diffusivity (≈ 10-9 cm2s-1), as deduced from in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) experiments. The anode retains 89% of its initial capacity retention at 5C after 500 cycles and extraordinary rate performances (105 mAh g-1 at 5C). When the NASICON-Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode paired with the sodium filled anode, the full Na-ion cell delivers a remarkable energy density of 98 Wh kg-1 (based on the mass of anode and cathode) compared to the state-of-the-art NASICON-based Na-ion full cells and provides 80% capacity retention at 5C rate over 1000 long cycles. This work creates new opportunities for chemical and structural modifications that improve the electrochemical performance of NASICON anodes.\n \n References:\n \n \n C. Masquelier and L.

The transition to commercialization of room temperature, rechargeable sodium-ion batteries is ramping up, with several products already on the market. However, the safety characteristics of sodium-ion cells are not well known. This talk will address the gap by presenting findings from safety testing conducted on commercially available 18650 sodium-ion cells composed of a NaNiMnFeO cathode and a hard carbon anode.\n Safety testing included a range of temperature, mechanical, and electrical abuse conditions, including nail penetration, crush test, external short circuit, overcharging, and overtemperature. Furthermore, the heat flows associated with materials-level degradation and subsequent reactions were characterized through techniques including differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. The thermal characterization was used to delineate the underlying reaction pathways and support explanations of the, sometimes, dramatic outcomes observed in 18650 safety testing.\n Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc. for the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",

The electrochemical performances of sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles are studied as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. The galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements have been performed in a voltage range of 0.01-2.6 V vs. Na(+)/Na under different current densities, using the as-prepared sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles as a working electrode. Typically, the initial discharge and charge capacities of sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles are 475 and 380 mA h g(-1), respectively, at a current density of 20 mA g(-1). The sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles exhibit high capacity with a reversible discharge capacity of about 190 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles. It should be emphasized that the discharge reaction consists of two steps which correspond to voltage plateaus of 0.93 V and 0.85 V vs. Na(+)/Na in the first discharge curve of the Na/MoS2 battery, respectively. But there is only one apparent voltage plateau in the Na/Na-Mo-S battery, and it reduces to below 0.5 V vs. Na(+)/Na, which can enhance the power density. All of the findings demonstrate that sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles have steady cycling performance and environmental and cost friendliness as next generation secondary batteries.",

        "abstract": "Developing flexible power sources is crucially important to fulfill the need for wearable electronic devices, but state-of-the-art flexible electrodes cannot meet the requirements of practical applications because of their heavy weight and unsatisfactory mechanical properties. Here, we highlight a design strategy for constructing a novel robust three-dimensional (3D) flexible electrode with a unique sandwichlike N-doped carbon sponge/TiO2-δ/reduced graphene oxide (NCS/TiO2-δ/RGO) configuration. In this electrode architecture, ultrafine defect-rich TiO2-δ nanocrystals are spatially sandwiched by a 3D conformal carbon hybrid matrix, where the 3D porous NCS provides an interconnected open diffusion channel for efficient ionic accessibility while the conformal RGO coating layer serves as an additional upper current collector, resulting in a double continuous conductive network for fast electronic transport and guaranteeing excellent electrochemical reaction kinetics. Hence, the as-built NCS/TiO2-δ/RGO flexible electrodes exhibit high-rate capabilities and long-cycling life in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), and they also exhibit outstanding thermal stability under cycling at 55 °C. More remarkably, a flexible soft-package full battery based on a NCS/TiO2-δ/RGO anode and a LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (for LIBs) or Na0.67Fe0.3Mn0.3Co0.4O2 (for SIBs) cathode shows stable electrochemical characteristics under bending and folding, holding great potential for flexible energy storage devices.",

Herein, the micro/nanostructural Sb/graphene composite (Sb-O-G) is successfully prepared with the uniform Sb nanospheres (∼100 nm) bound on the graphene via oxygen bonds. It is revealed that the in-situ-constructed oxygen bonds play a significant role on enhancing Na-storage properties, especially the ultrafast charge/discharge capability. The oxygen-bond-enhanced Sb-O-G composite can deliver a high capacity of 220 mAh/g at an ultrahigh current density of 12 A/g, which is obviously superior to the similar Sb/G composite (130 mAh/g at 10 A/g) just without Sb-O-C bonds. It also exhibits the highest Na-storage capacity compared to Sb/G and pure Sb nanoparticles as well as the best cycling performance. More importantly, this Sb-O-G anode achieves ultrafast (120 C) energy storage in SIB full cells, which have already been shown to power a 26-bulb array and calculator.

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) materials are suitable anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) but still suffer from insufficient initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). Promoting sodium storage via the pore filling mechanism is an effective way to improve the ICE, and the key here is regulating the pore structures of HC. In this work, coal-derived HC is successfully engineered with abundant accessible closed nanopores by treating the coal precursors with a facile destructive oxidation strategy. Investigations demonstrate that the destructive oxidation strategy can not only introduce abundant oxygen-containing functional groups (OFGs) but also decrease the size of graphitic microcrystals. Thus, the OFGs significantly enhance the crosslinking of small graphitic microcrystals and stimulate the formation of accessible closed nanopores during carbonization, which eventually improves the ICE by promoting the pore filling mechanism. The optimized HC exhibits so far the highest ICE (92.2%) among coal-derived SIB anode materials, together with a considerable capacity of 328.5 mAh g-1 at 90 mA g-1 and a capacity retention of 95.1% after 150 cycles. The results provide guidelines for developing high-performance HC materials toward the large-scale application of SIBs, which is of great significance for future energy storage systems.",

To investigate the electrochemical reaction mechanism of ZnP2-C during sodiation/desodiaiton, various ex-situ analytical techniques were employed. During sodiation, ZnP2 in the composite was transformed into NaZn13 and Na3P phases, exhibiting a one-step conversion reaction. Conversely, Zn and P in the NaZn13 and the Na3P, respectively, were fully recombined to the original ZnP2 phase during desodiation. Owing to the one-step conversion/recombination of ZnP2 in the composite during cycling, ZnP2-C showed high electrochemical performance with a highly reversible capacity of 883 mAh g-1 after 130 cycles with no capacity deterioration and a fast C-rate capability of 500 mAh g-1 at 1C and 350 mAh g-1 at 3C.",

The major obstacle for the practical application of SIBs is the absence of suitable negative electrode materials with long cycling stability and high rate performance. Here, sulfur‐doped double‐shell sodium titanate (Na2Ti3O7) microspheres constructed from 2D ultrathin nanosheets are synthesized via a templating route combined with a low‐temperature sulfurization process. The resulting double‐shell microspheres deliver a high specific capacity (≈222 mAh g−1 at 1 C), excellent cycling stability (162 mAh g−1 after 15 000 cycles at 20 C), and superior rate capability (122 mAh g−1 at 50 C) as anode for SIBs. The improved electrochemical properties originate from synergistic effects between the unique double‐shell nanostructures built from 2D nanosheets architecture and sulfur doping. This synergistic effect not only stabilize Na2Ti3O7‐based electrode during the cycling, but also improve the sluggish Na insertion/extraction kinetics by narrowing the bandgap of Na2Ti3O7. The synthesis strategy proposed here can be developed into a technical rationale for generating high‐performance sodium‐storage devices.",

        "abstract": "Carbonaceous materials are considered strong candidates as anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), which are expected to play an indispensable role in the carbon‐neutral era. Herein, novel braided porous carbon fibres (BPCFs) are prepared using the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method. The BPCFs possess interwoven porous structures and abundant vacancies. The growth mechanism of the BPCFs can be attributed to the polycrystalline transformation of the nanoporous copper catalyst in the early stage of CVD process. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the Na+ adsorption energies of the mono‐vacancy edges of the BPCFs (−1.22 and −1.09 eV) are lower than that of an ideal graphene layer (−0.68 eV), clarifying in detail the adsorption‐dominated sodium storage mechanism. Hence, the BPCFs as an anode material present an outstanding discharge capacity of 401 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 500 cycles. Remarkably, this BPCFs anode, under high‐mass‐loading of 5 mg cm−2, shows excellent long‐term cycling ability with a reversible capacity of 201 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1 over 1000 cycles. This study provided a novel strategy for the development of high‐performance carbonaceous materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Metal phosphorus trichalcogenides have been regarded as promising high-capacity anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high reversible capacity. Nevertheless, their practical application is plagued by poor diffusion kinetics and dramatic volume fluctuations during the charge-discharge process, resulting in no satisfactory rate and life span so far. Herein, we propose a space-confinement strategy to remarkably promote the cycling stability and rate capacity by embedding FePS3 particles in the interlayer of expanded graphite (EG), which are derived from in situ transformation of graphite intercalation compounds. The layered EG not only greatly alleviates the volume fluctuations of FePS3 by the space confinement effect so as to maintain the stability of the electrode microstructure, but it also ensures rapid Na+ and electron transfer during cycling. When acting as an anode for SIBs, the hybrid electrode delivers a highly reversible capacity of 312.5 mAh g-1 at an ultrahigh rate of 50 A g-1 while retaining an ultralong life span of 1300 cycles with a retention of 82.4% at 10 A g-1. Moreover, the excellent performance of the assembled full battery indicates the practical application potential of FPS/EG.",

        "abstract": "Optimisation of the annealing time for the fabrication of nitrogen-doped graphitic-spheres (NDGSs), formed from a nitrogen-functionalised aromatic precursor at 800 °C, to give high nitrogen doping has been performed. Thorough analysis of the NDGSs, approximately 3 μm in diameter, pinpointed an optimum annealing time of 6 to 12 hours to obtain highest nitrogen content at the surface of the spheres (reaching a stoichiometry of around C3N at the surface and C9N in the bulk), with the quantity of sp2 and sp3 surface nitrogen varying with annealing time. The results suggest that changes in the nitrogen dopant level occur through slow diffusion of the nitrogen throughout the NDGSs, along with reabsorption of nitrogen-based gases produced during annealing. A stable bulk nitrogen dopant level of 9% was revealed in the spheres. The NDGSs performed well as anodes in lithium-ion batteries, providing a capacity of up to 265 mA h g−1 at a charging rate of C/20, but did not perform well in sodium-ion batteries without the use of diglyme, consistent with the presence of graphitic regions, but with low internal porosity.",

Herein, we decorated multilayer MXene (Ti3C2Tx) with Sb nanoparticles (NPs) via a facile solution-phase method, in which Sb NPs with a diameter of about 5–10 nm are absorbed on the surface of MXene layers by the electrostatic attraction action. The hybrid material Ti3C2Tx@Sb-0.5 delivers a higher reversible capacity of 200 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 than that of pure Ti3C2Tx (90 mA h g−1), and shows a much better capacity retention of nearly 98% after 500 cycles compared with Sb NPs. Also, it achieves superior rate performance (remaining a capacity of 127 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1) and excellent long-term stability (a capacity retention of almost 92.3% after 8000 cycles).

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfides are recognized as an excellent alternative to sodium ion anodes ascribed to the outstanding theoretical capacity. The unique crystal arrangement of VS4 gives it exceptional theoretical capacity, despite challenges like insufficient electrical conductivity and undesirable volume expansion. Herein, a novel stabilized anode featuring a distinctive 3D hollow spherical structure is proposed, providing a simple strategy to synthesize such anodes for VS4-HCMSs bonded via C-O-S and V-O-C interfaces. The kinetic investigations and density functional theory reveal that the unique structure connected by interfacial bonds enhances Na+ transport rate and charge transfer efficiency, while carbon greatly mitigates the volume expansion. Unsurprisingly, the VS4-HCMSs exhibit an impressive first-cycle Coulombic efficiency of 91.31% and an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 612 mAh g-1 after 300 cycles at 0.5 A g-1, even exhibit the reversible capacity of 498.8 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 5 A g-1. Additionally, the NaFePO4//VS4-HCMSs full cell is cycled for 200 cycles at 0.2 C and powered the light-emitting diodes for up to 30 minutes afterward. Overall, this work enhances the conductivity and stability of the material by combining VS4 with hollow carbon mesoporous spheres through interfacial bonding, offering an efficient strategy to anode materials in sodium-ion batteries.",

Herein, an \"embryo\" strategy is proposed for synthesis of nanorod-embedded MoO2 /MoS2 /C network nanoarchitecture as anode for SIBs with high-rate performance. Interestingly, L-cysteine which plays triple roles including sulfur source, reductant, and carbon source can be utilized to produce the sulfur vacancy-enriched heterostructure. Specifically, L-cysteine can combine with metastable monoclinic MoO3 nanorods at room temperature to encapsulate the \"nutrient\" of MoOx analogues (MoO2.5 (OH)0.5 and MoO3 ·0.5H2 O) and hydrogen-deficient L-cysteine in the \"embryo\" precursor affording for subsequent in situ multistep heating treatment. The resultant MoO2 /MoS2 /C presents a high-rate capability of 875 and 420 mAh g-1 at 0.5 and 10 A g-1 , respectively, which are much better than the MoS2 -based anode materials reported by far. Finite element simulation and analysis results verify that the volume expansion can be reduced to 42.8% from 88.8% when building nanorod-embedded porous network structure. Theoretical calculations reveal that the sulfur vacancies and heterointerface engineering can promote the adsorption and migration of Na+ leading to highly enhanced thermodynamic and kinetic reaction.

Modification of Y5−xPrxSb3−ySny alloys by carbon nanotubes allowed us to significantly increase the discharge capacity of both types of batteries, which reaches 280 mAh · g−1 (for LIBs) and 160 mAh · g−1 (for SIBs), respectively.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted tremendous attention as potential low-cost energy storage alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to the intrinsic safety and great abundance of sodium. For developing competitive SIBs, highly efficient anode materials with large capacity and rapid ion diffusion are indispensable. In this study, a two-dimensional (2D) Dirac monolayer, that is, borophosphene, is proposed as a promising anode material for high performance SIBs on the basis of density functional theory calculations. The performances of Na adsorption and diffusion, maximum specific capacity, open circuit voltage, cyclical stability and electronic properties combined with Bader charge analysis are explored. It is found that borophosphene can spontaneously adsorb a Na atom with a binding energy of -0.838 eV. A low diffusion energy barrier of 0.221 eV suggests rapid ion conductivity. More intriguingly, a maximum specific capacity of 1282 mA h g-1 can be achieved in borophosphene, which is one of the largest values reported for 2D anode materials for SIBs. A low average voltage of 0.367 V is estimated, implying a suitable operating voltage of the anode material. The metallic properties, tiny surface expansion, and good kinetic stability of sodiated borophosphene give rise to high electrical conductivity and favorable cyclability. These abovementioned advantages suggest that borophosphene can be used as a Dirac anode material for SIBs with excellent performance including a large specific capacity, high-rate capability, and favorable cyclability.",

In addition, a new kind of polysulfonamide-supported poly(ethylene glycol) divinyl ether based polymer electrolyte is also demonstrated for monolithic sodium ion battery via in situ preparation.

Nonetheless, the implementation of NIBs is seriously hindered because of their low rate capability and cycling stability. This is mainly because the large ionic size of Na+ can reduce the structural stability and cause sluggish reaction kinetics of electrode materials. Herein, three-dimensional nanoarchitectured coral-like CoSe2@N-doped carbon (CL-CoSe2@NC) was synthesized through solvothermal and selenizing techniques. As a result, CL-CoSe2@NC for NIBs at 2 A g-1 exhibits an ultrahigh specific capacity of 345.4 mA h g-1 after 2800 cycles and a superhigh initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 93.1%. Ex situ XRD, HRTEM, SAED and XPS were executed to study the crystal structure evolution between Na and CoSe2 during sodiation/de-sodiation processes. The aforementioned results indicate that the improved sodium storage property of CL-CoSe2@NC could be attributed to better electrode kinetics and a stable SEI film because of the 3D nanoarchitecture and the existence of the NC layer.",

As a result, the OHTAPQ@Na||OHTAPQ@Na symmetric cell shows a long‐term cycle lifespan (over 1500 h at 2 mA cm−2), and the OHTAPQ@Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 cells deliver a capacity retention of 82% after 1600 cycles. This research provides a handy way for anode protection with functional conjugated organics in SMBs.",

        "abstract": "Heterojunction, with the advantage of fast charge transfer dynamics, is considered to be an effective strategy to address the low capacity and poor rate capability of anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). As well, carbonaceous materials, as a crucial additive, can effectively ameliorate the ion/electron conductivity of integrated composites, realizing the fast ion transport and charge transfer. Here, motivated by the enhancement effect of carbon and heterojunction on conductivity, it is proposed that the CoSe2 /WSe2 heterojunction as inner core is coated by carbon outer shell and uniformly embedded in porous carbon nanosheets (denoted as CoSe2 /WSe2 @C/CNs), which is used as anode material for SIBs. Combining with density functional theoretical calculations, it is confirmed that the structure of heterojunction can introduce built-in electric-field, which can accelerate the transportation of Na+ and improve the conductivity of electrons. Moreover, the introduction of porous carbon nanosheets (CNs) can provide a channel for the transportation of Na+ and avoid the volume expansion during Na+ insertion and extraction process. As it is expected, CoSe2 /WSe2 @C/CNs anode displays ultrastable specific capacity of 501.9 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 over 200 cycles, and ultrahigh rate capacity of 625 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Zn anode is confronted with serious Zn dendrite growth and water-induced parasitic reactions, which severely hinders the rapid development and practical application of aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs). Herein, inspired by sodium hyaluronate (SH) biomolecules in living organisms featured with the functions of water retention, ion-transport regulation, and film-formation, the SH working as a dynamic and self-adaptive \"mask\" is proposed to stabilize Zn anode. Benefiting from the abundant functional groups with high hydrophilicity and zincophilicity, SH molecule can constrain active water molecules on the Zn-electrolyte interface and participate in Zn2+ solvation structure to suppress parasitic reactions. Furthermore, the dynamical adsorption of SH with high-density negative charge on the Zn surface could serve as Zn2+ reservoirs to guide uniform Zn deposition. Consequently, stable Zn plating and an ultrahigh cumulative plating capacity (CPC) of 4.8 Ah cm-2 are achieved even at 20 mA cm-2 (20 mAh cm-2 ) in a Zn||Zn symmetric battery, reaching a record level in AZMBs. In addition, the Zn||β-MnO2 full battery exhibits a substantially improved cycle stability.

        "abstract": "Graphene-like graphite (GLG) is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries, which is believed to have unique kinetic properties compared to hard carbon due to its different intercalation mechanism. In this study, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to investigate the kinetic properties of sodium-ion intercalation in GLG. Our results indicated that the activation energies for interfacial sodium-ion transfer of GLGs were nearly identical to those reported for graphite, regardless of the heat treatment temperature of the GLGs. Furthermore, these activation energies were lower than those observed for hard carbon, suggesting better sodium-ion intercalation kinetics. In addition, the diffusion coefficient of sodium ions in the GLG was similar to that of graphite, with the highest value observed for GLG800, the GLG heat-treated at the highest temperature of 800 °C. This may indicate that the diffusion coefficient increases with the presence of nanopores in the graphene layer of GLG. It has also been reported that GLG800 is superior in terms of reversible capacity and working potential compared to GLGs synthesized at other temperatures. Consequently, the results clearly demonstrated that GLG800 has the best electrochemical properties in terms of both thermodynamics and kinetics among the GLGs investigated in this study.",

The hierarchical architecture is characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. The as-obtained MgMoO4 nanoplates showed a porous structure with a pore-size distribution ranging from 50 to 70 nm. This porosity provides an electron transport pathway and enhanced surface reaction kinetics. The binding energies measured for Mg 2p, Mo 3d, 3p and O 1s are consistent with the literature, and with the metal ions being present as M(ii) and M(vi) states, respectively. This indicates that the oxidation states of the metal cations are as expected. The electrochemical behaviour of MgMoO4 was investigated using aqueous (NaOH) and non-aqueous solvents (NaClO4 in EC : DMC : FEC) for supercapacitor and battery applications. The sodium-ion capacitor involves ion absorption and insertion into the MgMoO4 electrodes resulting in superior power and energy densities. However, the cycling stability was found to be stable only for an aqueous system. The formation of a solid electrolyte surface layer restricted the reversible capacity of the MgMoO4 in the sodium-battery. Nevertheless, it does offer some promise as an anode material for storing energy with high rate performance and excellent capacity retention. Detailed comparative analyses of various electrolytes in storage devices such as hybrid sodium-ion capacitors and sodium-ion batteries are vital for the integration of hierarchical structured materials into practical applications.

        "abstract": "Conversion electrodes, which can realize high capacities by employing the wider valence states of transition metals, are investigated for sodium storage and applied for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Importantly, this work is a first report for the sodium storage ability and related storage mechanism in oxalate compounds, specifically cobalt oxalate (CoC2O4) nanorods. The nanorods are intimately blended with acetylene black powders to achieve sufficient electrical conductivity (∼10-3 S cm-1). The resulting C-CoC2O4 electrode delivers an initial capacity of about 330 mA h (g-CoC2O4)-1 at a rate of 0.2 C (60 mA g-1) and preserves 75% of the initial capacity over 200 cycles. A high charge (oxidation) capacity, ∼111 mA h g-1, was achieved even at 30 C (9000 mA g-1). This remarkable electrode performance is reported for the first time for metal oxalate compounds tested for Na cells, to the best of our knowledge. X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy analyses lead to the proposal of a new sodium storage mechanism. For this mechanism, CoC2O4 is converted into Co metal involving with the creation of Na2C2O4 on discharge (reduction), and the Co metal is recovered to CoC2O4 on charge. The employed electroconducting carbon is likely to provide good electron conduction paths, which enables fast conversion on both discharge and charge. A full cell comprised of the C-CoC2O4 anode and carbon-coated NaCrO2 cathode exhibits good retention capacity over prolonged cycling, with retention of about 84.7% of the first capacity [107 mA h (g-NaCrO2)-1] for 300 cycles, and is active at a rate of 5 C (550 mA g-1), with a capacity of 79.5 mA h g-1. This result demonstrates the potential of applying C-CoC2O4 as an anode material for rechargeable SIBs.",

Structural and morphological features are analyzed through various characterization techniques such as XRD, FE-SEM, HR-TEM, and XPS.

Herein, a functional electrolyte containing 1.0 m NaCF3 SO3 in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME) (1.0 m NaCF3 SO3 -DEGDME) is developed, which can be readily used for NiCo2 S4 anode with high initial coulomb efficiency (96.2%), enhanced cycling performance, and boosted capacities (341.7 mA h g-1 after 250 continuous cycles at the current density of 200 mA g-1 ). The electrochemical tests and related phase characterization combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicate the ether-based electrolyte is more suitable for the NiCo2 S4 anode in SIBs due to the formation of a stable electrode-electrolyte interface.

        "abstract": "LiNixMnyCozO2 cathode materials combined with Si‐based anode materials are current state‐of‐the‐art high energy density chemistries for lithium ion batteries. Increasing the upper cut‐off voltage is an intriguing approach to achieve even higher energy density in lithium ion batteries. However, poor oxidation stability of the state‐of‐the‐art electrolytes leads to transition metal dissolution (TMD), migration, and deposition (TMDMD) on the negative electrode, followed by sudden and rapid capacity fade. Furthermore, the chemical instability of the lithium hexafluorophosphate causes hydro‐fluoric acid to develop, which targets the native SiOx layers on silicon anodes and breaks the chemical bond to the carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt binder. Herein, a fluorine‐rich electrolyte formulation consisting of lithium‐bis(fluorsulfonyl)imide with fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC): bis(2,2,2,) trifluoroethyl carbonate (BFEC) was applied in NMC811||10%SiOx‐90%graphite cells to achieve high oxidation stability and prevent TMD and deposition. Up‐to‐date, this is the premier electrochemical performance reported in literature with a capacity retention of 94.5% and 92.2% with 0.5 °C and 4.5 V upper cut‐off voltage cycling at 20 and 40 °C after 100 cycles, respectively. The post mortem analysis showed that stabilization is achieved by forming inorganic‐ and salt‐rich interphases that protect the electrolyte versus decomposition at the electrode.",

        "title": "(Best Student Presentation) Uncovering the Electrochemical Sodium-Solvent Co-Intercalation Reaction with Graphite",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is on the verge of commercialisation, with several companies announcing large scale production during 2023. SIBs have many similarities with lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), and offers comparable cycle life, as well as specific energies and power as LIBs while often being made with more abundant materials.[1] There is, however, a clear difference between LIBs and SIBs when it comes to the ions interaction with graphite – the standard anode in LIBs. Sodium-ions are unable to form thermodynamically stable structures inside graphite with high specific capacities,[2] often showing less than 20 mAh/g. But, in 2014 it was shown that when a diglyme (G2) based electrolyte was used suddenly 110 mAh/g of sodium-ion could be stored inside graphite through a solvent co-intercalation mechanism, i.e., solvated sodium-ions can be stored in much larger quantities in graphite than bare ions.[3] Surprisingly, even if the reaction is accompanied by a large expansion of the graphite to accommodate the solvated ions, the reaction is highly reversible and very fast, with thousands of cycles having been reported and current densities of several A/g seem to have no large impact on the storage capability.[4] The system is also able to operate at low temperatures, and shows a great deal of tunability through small changes in the electrolyte composition.[5-7] These properties opens up for applications in grid energy storage, as the system is able to deliver a moderate amount of energy, but at high power over a wide temperature range and over many cycles, while also being made by cheap and available resources.\n Even if several articles have been published on the subject, many fundamental questions about the reaction remain debated, such as the existence of and possible properties of an SEI that allows solvated ions through, or the stoichiometry of the reaction itself. It is often argued that either the entire solvation shell, consisting of 2 G2 molecules, is intercalated along with Na+, or partial desolvation occurs and only a part of the solvation shell enters the graphite, Figure 1. Yet, there is very little evidence for either case. Here, we report on two independent methods, one relying on ex-situ analysis of the graphite weight at different potentials and one on in-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, that shows that the reaction when using a G2 or monoglyme (G1) based electrolyte is far more complicated than previously thought and changes drastically during the sodiation process. We show that at high voltages the system is opened up by solvated ions and is subsequently flooded with solvent molecules, and these flooding events occur again during parts of the sodiation process. After the system has successfully formed a stage I compound the system enters a non-faradaic process where the free glyme molecules inside the graphite is preferentially replaced by solvated ions until the graphite reach its full storage capacity of solvated ions.\n The mass measurements and impedance measurements are supplemented with ab initio molecular dynamics of the electrolytes, and density functional theory simulations of solvated ions inside of graphite. The proposed electrochemical process is also compared with and corroborated by material characterisation techniques, such as electrochemical dilatometry and operando X-ray techniques, as well as NMR measurements.\n \n References:\n \n [1] P.

        "abstract": "\n Tin oxide (SnO2) is a useful anode material due to its high capacity (1493 and 1378 mAh g-1 vs Li/Li+ and vs Na/Na+, respectively) and natural abundance (tin is one of the 30 most abundant elements on earth). Unfortunately, only moderate electrical conductivity and significant volume expansion of up to 300% for Li-ion, and as much as 520% for Na-ion can occur. Here, we use an ordered macroporous interconnected inverse opal (IO) architectures to enhance rate capability, structural integrity, and gravimetric capacity, without conductive additives and binders. Excellent capacity retention is shown during cycling vs Na/Na+ relative to Li/Li+. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis, galvanostatic cycling, and differential capacity analysis extracted from rate performance testing evidence the irreversibility of the oxidation of metallic Sn to SnO2 during charge. This behavior allows for a very stable electrode during cycling at various rates. A stable voltage profile and rate performance is demonstrated for both systems. In a Na-ion half cell, the SnO2 retained >76% capacity after 100 cycles, and a similar retention after rate testing.",

        "abstract": "A tin-decorated reduced graphene oxide, originally developed for lithium-ion batteries, has been investigated as an anode in sodium-ion batteries. The composite has been synthetized through microwave reduction of poly acrylic acid functionalized graphene oxide and a tin oxide organic precursor. The final product morphology reveals a composite in which Sn and SnO2 nanoparticles are homogenously distributed into the reduced graphene oxide matrix. The XRD confirms the initial simultaneous presence of Sn and SnO2 particles. SnRGO electrodes, prepared using Super-P carbon as conducting additive and Pattex PL50 as aqueous binder, were investigated in a sodium metal cell. The Sn-RGO showed a high irreversible first cycle capacity: only 52% of the first cycle discharge capacity was recovered in the following charge cycle. After three cycles, a stable SEI layer was developed and the cell began to work reversibly: the practical reversible capability of the material was 170 mA·h·g−1. Subsequently, a material of formula NaLi0.2Ni0.25Mn0.75Oδ was synthesized by solid-state chemistry. It was found that the cathode showed a high degree of crystallization with hexagonal P2-structure, space group P63/mmc. The material was electrochemically characterized in sodium cell: the discharge-specific capacity increased with cycling, reaching at the end of the fifth cycle a capacity of 82 mA·h·g−1. After testing as a secondary cathode in a sodium metal cell, NaLi0.2Ni0.25Mn0.75Oδ was coupled with SnRGO anode to form a sodium-ion cell. The electrochemical characterization allowed confirmation that the battery was able to reversibly cycle sodium ions. The cell’s power response was evaluated by discharging the SIB at different rates. At the lower discharge rate, the anode capacity approached the rated value (170 mA·h·g−1). By increasing the discharge current, the capacity decreased but the decline was not so pronounced: the anode discharged about 80% of the rated capacity at 1 C rate and more than 50% at 5 C rate.",

The microstructure evolution studied using X-ray diffraction, Raman, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, along with electrochemical measurements, reveals the optimal carbonization condition of the mangosteen shell: HC carbonized at 1500 °C for 2 h delivers the highest reversible capacity of ∼330 mA h g–1 at a current density of 20 mA g–1, a capacity retention of ∼98% after 100 cycles, and an ICE of ∼83%.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion hybrid capacitors are known for their high power densities and superior cycle-life compared to Na-ion batteries. However, low energy densities (˂ 100 Wh kg-1) due to the lack of high capacity (˃ 150 mAh g-1) anodes capable of fast-charging are delaying their practical implementation. Herein, we report a high-performance Na-ion hybrid capacitor based on interface engineered hierarchical TiO2 nanosheet anode consisting of bronze (~ 15%) and anatase (~ 85%) crystallites (~ 10 nm). This pseudocapacitive dual-phase anode demonstrated exceptional specific capacity of 289 mAh g-1@ 0.025 A g-1, and excellent rate capability (110 mAh g-1@ 1.0 A g-1). Na-ion hybrid capacitor integrating dual-phase hierarchical TiO2 nanosheet anode and activated carbon cathode exhibited a high energy density of 200 Wh kg-1 (based on the total mass of active materials in both electrodes) and power density of 6191 W kg-1. These values are in the energy and power density range of Li-ion batteries (100-300 Wh kg-1) and supercapacitors (5000-15000 W kg-1) respectively. Furthermore, exceptional capacity retention of 80% is observed after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. Outstanding electrochemical performance of the demonstrated Na-ion hybrid capacitor is credited to the enhanced pseudocapacitive Na-ion intercalation of two-dimensional TiO2 anode resulting from nanointerfaces between bronze and anatase crystallites. Mechanistic investigations evidenced Na-ion storage through intercalation pseudocapacitance with minimal structural changes. This approach of nanointerfaces induced pseudocapacitance presents great opportunities towards developing advanced electrode materials for next-generation Na-ion hybrid capacitors.",

        "abstract": "Anatase TiO2 is a promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high specific capacity, low cost, and excellent cycle stability. However, low electrical conductivity and poor Na+ ion transport in TiO2 limit its practical applications. Here, substantially boosted Na+ ion transport and charge transfer kinetics are demonstrated by constructing a near-ideal non-rectifying titanium carbonitride/nitrogen-doped TiO2 (TiCx N1- x /N-TiO2 ) heterostructure. Owing to the fast plasma effects and metastable hybrid phases, the TiCx N1- x is epitaxially grown on TiO2 . Energy band engineering at the interface induces high electron densities and a strong built-in electric field, which lowers the Na+ diffusion barrier by a factor of 1.7. As a result, the TiCx N1- x /N-TiO2 electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. The reversible specific capacities at rates of 0.1 and 10 C reach 312.3 and 173.7 mAh g-1 , respectively. After 600 cycles of charge and discharge at 10 C, the capacity retention rate is 98.7%. This work discovers an effective non-equilibrium plasma-enabled process to construct heterointerfaces that can enhance Na+ ion transport and provides generic guidelines for the design of heterostructures for a broader range of energy storage, separation, and other devices that rely on controlled ionic transport.",

However, the achievement of superior initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and high Na‐storage capacity via low‐temperature carbonization remains challenging due to the presence of tremendous defects with few closed pores. Here, a facile hybrid carbon framework design is proposed from the polystyrene precursor bearing distinct molecular bridges at a low pyrolysis temperature of 800°C via in situ fusion and embedding strategy. This is realized by integrating triazine‐ and carbonyl‐crosslinked polystyrene nanospheres during carbonization. The triazine crosslinking allows in situ fusion of spheres into layered carbon with low defects and abundant closed pores, which serves as a matrix for embedding the well‐retained carbon spheres with nanopores/defects derived from carbonyl crosslinking. Therefore, the hybrid hard carbon with intimate interface showcases synergistic Na ions storage behavior, showing an ICE of 70.2%, a high capacity of 279.3 mAh g−1, and long‐term 500 cycles, superior to carbons from the respective precursor and other reported carbons fabricated under the low carbonization temperature.

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) stands out as the most prospective anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) with significant potential for commercial applications. However, some long-standing and intractable obstacles, like low first coulombic efficiency (ICE), poor rate capability, storage capacity, and cycling stability, have severely hindered the conversion process from laboratory to commercialization. The above-mentioned issues are closely related to Na+ transfer kinetics, surface chemistry, and internal pseudo-graphitic carbon content. Herein, constructing molybdenum-modified hard carbon solid spheres (Mo2C/HC-5.0), both the ion transfer kinetics, surface chemistry, and internal pseudo-graphitic carbon content are comprehensively improved. Specifically, Mo2C/HC-5.0 with higher pseudo-graphitic carbon content provides a large number of active sites and a more stable layer structure, resulting in improved sodium storage capacity, rate performance, and cycling stability. Moreover, the lower defect density and specific surface area of Mo2C/HC-5.0 further enhance ICE and sodium storage capacity. Consequently, the Mo2C/HC-5.0 anode achieves a high capacity of 410.7 mA h g-1 and an ICE of 83.9% at 50 mA g-1. Furthermore, the material exhibits exceptional rate capability and cycling stability, maintaining a capacity of 202.8 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1 and 214.9 mA h g-1 after 800 cycles at 1 A g-1.",

The intrinsic in-plane cavities in GDY shells offer three-dimensional Na+ transporting channels, enabling fast Na+ diffusion through the GDY shells. Electrochemical kinetics analyses show that the Sb@Void@GDY NBs exhibit faster Na+ transport kinetics than traditional Sb@C NBs. In situ transmission electron microscopy analysis reveals that the hollow structure and the void space between Sb and GDY successfully accommodate the volume change of Sb during cycling, and the plastic GDY shell maintains the structural integrity of NBs. Benefiting from the above structural merits, the Sb@Void@GDY NBs exhibit excellent rate capability and extraordinary cycling stability.",

        "abstract": "Organic compounds have become a potentially important choice for a new generation of energy-storage electrode materials due to their designability, flexibility, green sustainability, and abundance. However, the applications of organic electrode materials are still limited because of their dissolution in electrolytes and low electrical conductivity, which in turn cause poor cycling stability. Here, for the first time, we report 2-amino-4-thiazole-acetic acid (ATA) and its sodium salt, sodium 2-amino-4-thiazol-derived polymer (PATANa), as an anode. The PATANa showed a two-dimensional (2D) nanosheet structure, offering a larger contact area with the electrolyte and a shorter ion-migration path, which improved the ion-diffusion kinetics. The polymer showed excellent cycling stability and outstanding rate capability when tested as an anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). It could deliver a high reversible specific capacity of 303 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 for 100 cycles and maintain a high discharge capacity of 190 mA h g-1 after 1000 long cycle numbers even at a high current density of 1000 mA g-1. This approach of salinizing the polymer opens a new way to develop anode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

However, the design and development of highly efficient SIBs represent a great challenge. Here, a unique and reliable approach is reported to prepare carbon nitride (CN) hybridized with nickel iron sulfide (NFCN) using simple reaction between Ni-Fe layered double hydroxide and dithiooxamide. The characterization results demonstrate that the hybridization with optimal amount of CN induces local distortion in the crystal structure of the hybrid, which would benefit SIB performance. Systematic electrochemical studies with a half-cell configuration show that the present hybrid structure exhibits a promising reversible specific capacity of 348 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles with good rate capability. Simulation result reveals that the iron atoms in nickel iron sulfide act as a primary active site to accommodate Na+ ions. At last, with a full cell configuration using NFCN and Na3 V2 (PO4 )2 O2 F as the anode and cathode, respectively, the specific capacity appears to be ≈95 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 condition. This excellent performance of these hybrids can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the incorporated CN species and the high conductivity of nickel-iron sulfide.",

        "abstract": "Graphene/metal oxides (G/MO) composite materials have attracted much attention as the anode of sodium ion batteries (SIBs), because of the high theoretical capacity. However, most metal oxides operate based on the conversion mechanism and the alloying mechanism has changed to Na2O after the first cycle. The influence of G/Na2O (G/N) on the subsequent sodiation process has never been clearly elucidated. In this work, we report a systematic investigation on the G/N interface from both aspects of theoretical simulation and experiment characterization. By applied first-principles simulations, we find that the sluggish kinetics in the G/MO materials is mainly caused by the high diffusion barrier (0.51 eV) inside the Na2O bulk, while the G/N interface shows a much faster transport kinetics (0.25 eV) via unique double-interstitialcy mechanism. G/N interface possesses an interfacial storage of Na atom through the charge separation mechanism. The experimental evidence confirms that high interfacial ratio structure of G/N greatly improves the rate performance and endows G/MO materials the interfacial storage. Furthermore, the experimental investigation finds that the high interfacial ratio structure of G/N also benefits from the reversible reaction between SnO2 and Sn during cycling. Lastly, the effects of (N, O, S) doping in graphene systems at the G/N interface were also explored. This work provides a fundamental comprehension on the G/MO interface structure during the sodiation process, which is helpful to design energy storage materials with high rate performance and large capacity.",

Here, Sn-Sb electrodes were synthesized with compositional control by optimizing electrodeposition parameters and stoichiometry in solution and the alloys were cycled in sodium-ion half-cells to investigate the effects of stoichiometry on both performance and electrochemical phenomena. Higher concentrations of antimony deposited into the films were found to best maintain specific capacity over 270 cycles in the tin-antimony alloys, with each cell showing a slow, gradual decrease in capacity. We identified that a 1:3 ratio of Sn:Sb retained a specific capacity of 486 mAh/g after 270 cycles, highlighting a need to explore this material further. These results demonstrate how control over stoichiometry in Sn-Sb electrodes is a viable method for tuning performance.",

Density functional theory and finite element analysis indicate that Sn/NaSn3 is the crucial phase transition highly responsible for inducing surface cracks, particle aggregations, and cell failures. Eliminating this phase transition by the control of cutoff voltages successfully extends the cycle life of μ-Sn to 2500 cycles at 2 A g-1, much longer than ∼40 cycles in a regular voltage window. The specific capacity is still retained at ∼455 mAh g-1, leading to a capacity decay of only ∼0.0088% per cycle.

However, poor conductivity, severe volume change, and harmful aggregation of the material during charge/discharge lead to unsatisfying electrochemical performance. Herein, a facile and green strategy for yolk-shell structure based on the principle of metal evaporation is proposed. SnS2 nanoparticle is encapsulated in nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanobox (SnS2 @C). The carbon nanoboxes accommodate the volume change and aggregation of SnS2 during cycling, and form 3D continuous conductive carbon matrix by close contact. The well-designed structure benefits greatly in conductivity and structural stability of the material. As expected, SnS2 @C exhibits considerable capacity, superior cycling stability, and excellent rate capability in both SIBs and PIBs. Additionally, in situ Raman technology is unprecedentedly conducted to investigate the phase evolution of polysulfides. This work provides an avenue for facilely constructing stable and high-capacity metal dichalcogenide based anodes materials with optimized structure engineering.

Herein, a conceive of nanoflowers, assembled with Bi2S3 nanorods, is demonstrated to construct the multiphase composition involving TiO2 coating and polypyrrole (PPy) encapsulation. Bi2S3 acted as the dominating active material, in consideration of the low content of TiO2, which ensured the high capacity of the composite. The dual-structural restrain of the TiO2 and PPy coatings can effectively alleviate volume variation based on the pseudo-\"zero-strain\" effect of TiO2 and high flexibility of PPy shells. Meanwhile, the heterointerface greatly enhanced the coupling effect between Bi2S3 and TiO2 and thus improved the electrochemical performance, which was proved by the results of density functional theory calculation and electrochemical tests. Combining the regulation from the Bi2S3/TiO2 heterojunction and the dual-structural restrain effect, the Bi2S3/TiO2@PPy electrode exhibited excellent rate performance and superior cycle stability (275.8 mA h g-1 over 500 cycles at 10 A g-1).

Custom-designed organic materials have been pursued as sustainable alternative electrodes for sodium-ion batteries, offering a solution that bypasses the need for traditional high-temperature synthesis. However, the challenge lies in achieving the desired electrochemical properties through precise structural modulation and the incorporation of redox-active functional groups. In this study, a triptycene-based microporous organic ladder polymer is developed featuring redox-active quinone moieties, designed as an anode material for high-performance sodium-ion batteries. The vertically aligned quinone moieties in the porous ladder polymer prevent the eclipsed stacking of layers, thereby enhancing the exposure of electroactive sites to electrolyte ions. Additionally, the ladder polymer exhibits almost unimodal pores due to its structural rigidity, facilitating fast Na+ ion diffusion. The redox-active quinone moieties host Na+ ions, and the microporosity supports capacitive ion storage. Consequently, a high reversible specific capacity of 316 mAh g-1 has been achieved.

The control of surface chemistry is an effective approach for preparing novel MXenes and modifying their electrochemical properties. However, an in-depth and systematic atomic-scale study of the effect of surface termination on MXene stability and electrochemical performance is scarce and thus is highly desired. Here, through high-throughput first-principles calculations, 28 stable chalcogen-functionalized M2 CTz (M = V, Nb, and Ta, T = S, Se, and Te) under different chemical environments are identified. The reduction of termination coverage improves electrical conductivity but weakens in-plane stiffness. Intriguingly, based on charge transfer mechanism, the diffusion barrier of lithium/sodium atoms on the M2 CTz exhibits a volcano-like relationship with termination coverage, and the ion diffusion channel formed in half termination coverage greatly accelerates lithium ion diffusion and returns to or exceeds sodium ion diffusion rate at full termination coverage. V2 CSe2 /Nb2 CSz not only displays the large lithium/sodium capacity (592/409-466 mAhg-1 ) but also exhibits low barrier energy and open-circuit voltage, suggesting a promising candidate anode material for lithium/sodium-ion batteries.

As such, remarkable cycling stability is achieved for 4.3‐V Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) cathodes with 83.3% capacity retention over 3000 cycles at 1 C, significantly outperforming the carbonate counterpart (41.6% capacity retention). Meanwhile, the restrained SEI growth via reducing the formation of electron‐leaking Na2CO3 stabilizes the long‐term cycling of the hard carbon (HC) anode. The assembled NVOPF||HC full cells achieve superior rate capability (up to 15 C) and stable cycling stability over 500 cycles.

        "abstract": "Organic compounds have been utilized in rechargeable batteries as electrode materials on account of their designable structures and reversible redox properties. However, most of them suffer from problems with dissolution resulting in poor electrochemical performance. In this work, we adapt a sodium salt of tetracyanoquinodimethane (NaTCNQ) to work as a high redox potential cathode material in sodium ion batteries (SIBs). A porous carbon coated separator is demonstrated to be an adsorption layer and prevents the dissolved active material from migrating to the anode side. The NaTCNQ cell assembled with a carbon layer containing 5% activated carbon (AC) exhibits a higher initial capacity and greatly improved cycling stability. Using a conductive adsorption layer in organic redox batteries is a promising pathway to develop high performance organic electrode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) offer several benefits, including cost-efficiency and fast-charging characteristics, positioning them as attractive substitutes for lithium-ion batteries in energy storage applications. However, the inferior capacity and cycling stability of electrodes in SIBs necessitate further enhancement due to sluggish reaction kinetics. In this respect, the utilization of heterostructures, which can provide an inherent electric field and abundant active sites on the surface, has emerged as a promising strategy for augmenting the cycling stability and rate features of the electrodes. This work delves into the utilization of V1.13Se2/V2O3 heterostructure materials as anodes, initially fabricated via a simplified one-step solid-state sintering technique. The high pseudocapacitance and low characteristic relaxation time constant give the V1.13Se2/V2O3 heterostructure impressive properties, such as a high capacity of 328.5 mAh g-1 even after 1500 cycles at a high current density of 2 A g-1 and rate capability of 278.9 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1. Moreover, the assembled sodium-ion full battery delivers a capacity of 118.5 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1. These findings provide novel insight and guidance for the rapid synthesis of heterojunction materials and the advancement of SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The development of sodium ion battery (SIBs) is hindered by the rapid reduction in reversible capacity of the carbon-based anode materials. The outside-in doping on carbon-based anode has been extensively explored. Whereas nickel and NiS2 particles embedded nitrogen and sulfur co-doped porous graphene can significantly improve the electrochemical performance, we report a build-in heteroatom \"self-doping\" on albumen derived graphene for sodium storage. The build-in sulfur and nitrogen in albumen act as the doping source during the carbonization of proteins. The S-rich proteins in the albumen can also guide the doping and nucleation of the nickel sulfide nanoparticles. Besides, the porous architecture of the carbonized proteins is achieved through the removable KCl/NaCl salts (medium) at high-temperature melting conditions. And during the carbonization process, the nitrogen can reduce the carbonization temperature of thermally stable carbon materials. In this work, the NS- grapheme delivered a specific capacity of 108.3 mAh g-1 after 800 cycles under a constant current density of 500 mA g-1, In contrast, the Ni/NiS2/NS-graphene maintained a specific capacity of 134.4 mAh g-1.

        "abstract": "The number of MXene layers plays a crucial role in their performance when they are used as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Herein, Ti-based nitride MXenes with different layers, Ti x N x−1O2 MXene (x = 2, 3, 4) structures, were constructed to calculate the structural stability of their precursor, electronic properties after etching, and sodium storage behavior compared with the common Ti2CO2 and Ti3C2O2 MXene. First-principles calculations indicate that nitride MXenes possess a better rate capability than carbide MXenes of the same thickness. Moreover, the barrier for Na diffusion on the Ti2NO2 MXene surface (0.114 eV) is lowest. Meanwhile, comparing the properties of three nitride MXenes with different thicknesses, Ti2NO2 MXene performs relatively well with a high theoretical capacity with 756 mAh g−1 and a lower open circuit voltage of 1.1 V. In conclusion, the performance improvement of nitride MXene is not linear with thickness, because that of Ti3N2O2 MXene is relatively weaker. This work lays the foundation for the feasibility of Ti3N2T x experimental preparation and provides corresponding evidence on the choice of MXene thickness. More attention should be paid to the etching method for Ti2NT x MXene.",

Nonetheless, binary metal oxides still endure low electronic conductivity and huge volume expansion during the charge/discharge processes.

The X-ray diffraction analyses revealed pure-phased CoV2O4 (CVO) rGO-wrapped CoV2O4 (CVO/rGO) nanoparticles. The capacity retention of the CVO/rGO composite anode demonstrated 81.6% at the current density of 200 mA/g for more than 1000 cycles, which was better than that of the bare one of only 73.5% retention. The as-synthesized CVO/rGO exhibited remarkable cyclic stability and rate capability. The reaction mechanism of the CoV2O4 anode with sodium ions was firstly studied in terms of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and ex situ XRD analyses. These results articulated the manner of utilizing the graphene oxide-coated spinel-based novel anode-CoV2O4 as a potential anode for sodium ion batteries.",

Moreover, an effective strategy was designed to fabricate RPQDs/rGO nanohybrids for addressing the intrinsic issues of red P as anode materials for SIBs. Benefiting from the nanostructuring of red P and the coupling of RPQDs with rGO, the obtained nanohybrids not only promote electron and ion transfer, but also effectively enhance the electronic conductivity, restrain the aggregation of RPQDs and buffer the large volume changes of red phosphorus during the charge-discharge process. The nanohybrids deliver an initial specific capacity of 1161 mA h g-1 and a low capacity deterioration rate of less than 0.12% per cycle even after 250 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g-1. The feasibility of large-scale production of the RPQDs/rGO nanohybrid, associated with its outstanding Na-ion storage properties and low cost, demonstrates that the RPQDs/rGO hybrid is a very promising anode material for SIBs.",

However, many challenges remain for development of SIBs with high specific capacity, high rate capability, and long cycle life. Therefore, CuS as an important earth-abundant, low-cost semiconductor was applied as anode of SIBs with ether-based electrolyte instead of conventional ester-based electrolyte. By incorporating reduced graphene oxide (RGO) into CuS nanosheets and optimizing the cutoff voltage, it is found that the sodium-ion storage performance can be greatly enhanced using ether-based electrolyte. The CuS-RGO composites deliver an initial Coulombic efficiency of 94% and a maximum specific capacity of 392.9 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g-1. And a specific capacity of 345 mAh g-1 is kept after 450 cycles at a current density of 1 A g-1. Such an excellent electrochemical performance is ascribed to the conductive network construction of CuS-RGO composites, the suppression of dissolved polysulfide intermediates by using ether-based electrolyte, and the avoidance of conversion-type reaction by optimizing the cutoff voltage.",

        "abstract": "Developing efficient sodium-ion-storage mechanisms to increase the energy capacity in organic electrodes is a critical issue even after this period of prolonged effort. Uric acid (UA), a simple organic compound with three carbonyl groups is demonstrated to be electrochemically active in the insertion/extraction of Na ions. Theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations reveal that the sodium-ion storage by UA is a result of the stepwise mechanisms of p-π conjugation and the carbon anion. Aside from C═O, the functional group C═C(NH-)2 also provides an efficient Na-storage activated site in which the lone-pair electrons is stabilized through the planar-to-tetrahedral structural transition and low-energy orbital hybridization of N atoms. For further improvement of the electrochemical performance, a uric acid and carbon nanotube (UA@CNT) composite is prepared via a vacuum solution impregnation method. When employed as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries, the UA@CNT composite exhibits high specific capacity, excellent rate capability, and long cycling life even at high current densities. A reversible capacity of over 163 mA h g-1 is maintained even after 150 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g-1. The present study paves a way to develop reversible high-capacity organic electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries by a carbon-anion stabilization mechanism.",

        "abstract": "A sol-gel process followed by heat treatment derived a layered P2-type NaCoO2 cathode, which depicted unit cell parameters values of a = 2.8389 Å, c = 10.9899 Å, and V = 76.71 Å3 in powder X-ray diffraction pattern. The synthesized cathode exhibited hexagonal, 2D platelets with an ∼300 nm thickness. During the anodic and cathodic sweeps, the cyclic voltammograms revealed multiple redox peaks with the same current densities, shapes, and peak positions, associated with the highly reversible phase transition mechanism of the layered P2-type NaCoO2 cathode. The sodium cells yielded the capacities of 93/92 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C and 87/87 mAh g-1 at 1 C for the 50th charge-discharge cycles. The in situ multimode calorimetry (MMC) studies of sodium cells demonstrated a thermal explosion event, which occurred by sodium melting, short-circuit, electrode decomposition reaction, gas generation, exothermic reaction, released heat energy ,and cell gasket melting. Ultimately, the calculated released total heat energies of ∼550/740 J g-1 for in situ MMC studies and ∼312/594 J g-1 for ex situ DSC analyses (charge state at 4 V and discharge state at 2 V) show that the discharged state of sodiated layered P2-type NaCoO2 cathode material is more unsafe than the charge state. Furthermore, the ex situ differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) spectrum of a discharge state at 2 V of layered P2-type NaCoO2 revealed a decreased onset temperature (DOT) at 141 °C with two pronounced exothermic peaks at 197 and 266 °C with a released higher total heat energy of 594 J g-1 than the charge state heat energy at 312 J g-1, attributed to the higher charge onset temperature (COT) at 191 °C. Thus, the observed higher heat energy and decreased onset temperature for the discharge state at 2 V is associated with the higher Na+ ion in the discharge state of the layered P2-type NaxCoO2 cathode than that of the pristine cathode, showcasing that the layered P2-type NaCoO2 cathode is unsafe at the discharged condition for sodium-ion batteries.",

The as-obtained MCNO@DC nanofibers present superior sodium storage performance and retain an especially high specific capacity of 230 mAh g-1 with a large capacity retention of about 96% at 0.1 A g-1 after 500 cycles and a specific capacity of 107 mAh g-1 with capacity retention of about 89% at 1 A g-1 after 6500 cycles. The outstanding cycle characteristic is mainly due to the tiny MCNO nanoparticles, which shorten the ion migration distance, and the three-dimensional DC framework, which remarkably promotes the electronic transfer and efficiently limits the volume expansion during the progress of insertion and extraction of Na+ ions. Moreover, nitrogen doped in carbon is able to improve the electrochemical capability as well. Finally, kinetic analysis of the redox reactions is used to verify the pseudocapacitive mechanism in charge storage and the feasibility of using MCNO@DC composite nanofibers as an anode for sodium-ion batteries with the above-mentioned behavior.",

        "abstract": "Seeking an optimal catalyst to accelerate conversion reaction kinetics of room‐temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries is crucial for improving their electrochemical performance and promoting the practical applications. Herein, theoretical calculations of interfacial interactions of catalysts and polysulfides in terms of the surface adsorption state, interfacial ions migration, and electronic concentration around the Fermi level are systematically proposed as guiding principles of catalyst selection for RT Na–S batteries. As a case, MoN catalyst is accurately selected from transition metal nitrides with different d orbital electrons, and for experiment, it is introduced into the carbon nanofibers as a dual‐functioning host (MoN@CNFs). The MoN@CNFs can effectively anchor polysulfides and accelerate their conversion reaction. In addition, for the sodium anode, the MoN@CNFs can also induce uniform deposition of Na and inhibit dendrite growth, which are supported by in situ characterizations and finite element simulation technique. As a result, the as‐prepared RT Na–S battery displays high reversible capacity of 990 mAh g–1 at 0.2 A g–1 after 100 cycles and long lifespan over 1500 cycles at 2 A g–1. Even with high S loading of 5 mg cm–2, the RT Na–S battery still exhibits a high areal capacity of 2.5 mAh cm–2.",

        "abstract": "Heteroatom doping is an effective method to improve the electrochemical properties of hard carbon anodes for sodium-ion batteries. However, the different roles of surface and bulk heteroatoms in Na storage have not been explored much. Herein, N, P dual-doped carbon nanofibers (NP-CNFs) with high doping contents and low surface area are designed to clarify the above issue. It is confirmed that P plays a more crucial role in Na storage compared with N. In addition, surface and bulk P not only possess different configurations but also show distinct Na storage activity. There are only oxidized POx groups on the surface, which are inactive for Na storage but promote the stability of electrochemistry interphase, while in the bulk phase, unoxidized P-C bonds also emerge except POx, which shows preeminently reversible Na storage activity, and the POx groups are activated simultaneously. Furthermore, P-doping changes the reactivity of N-configurations with Na both on the surface and in the bulk phase, exhibiting interesting synergism. As expected, the surface stability, bulk activity, and synergism enable NP-CNFs to achieve superior performance. It could deliver a prominent capacity of 105.6 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 after 3000 cycles in half cells and 164.3 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 200 cycles in full cells.",

However, the intrinsic tight lignocellulosic structure in biomass hinders the formation of sufficient closed pores, limiting the specific capacity of obtained hard carbons. In this contribution, a mild, industrially mature pretreatment method is utilized to selectively regulate biomass components. The hard carbon with a rich closed pore structure is prepared by optimizing the appropriate ratio of biomass composition. Optimized etching conditions enhanced the closed pore volume of hard carbon from 0.15 to 0.26 cm3 g-1. Consequently, the engineered hard carbon exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, including a high reversible capacity of 346 mAh g-1 with a high plateau capacity of 254 mAh g⁻¹ at 50 mA g⁻¹, robust rate capability, and cycling stability. The optimized hard carbon shows an 88 mAh g⁻¹ increase in plateau capacity compared to hard carbon from directly carbonizing bamboo fibers.

        "abstract": "Interest in solid-state sodium-ion batteries (SSIBs) have resurged remarkably as a means of diversification in energy storage devices to address climate issues and further propelled by the movement of ‘Beyond-Li’. State of the art SSIBs not only offer energy security and sustainability but also comparable power and energy densities to their counter-parts. Yet to fully capitalise on the technology, the fundamental processes taking place between the anode and interface or ‘point of contact’ needs to be understood. Previous iterations of SSIBs have employed various solid-electrolyte candidates – most notable being beta-alumina – however with the recent advancements in synthesis and dopants more prominent solid-electrolytes have become interesting, one in particular being NaSICON (Sodium Super Ionic Conductor). NaSICON has several advantages, one of which is the reduction in operating temperatures of SSIBs due to its inherent fast sodium-ion transport1. This would broaden the potential applications of SSIBs, making the technology more accessible to a wider range of markets.\n Current perspectives on NaSICON solid-electrolytes have focused on optimising conductivity through means of additive dopants2 and synthesis procedures3. Yet at present, the understanding of the fundamentals of interfacial inhomogeneities that affect the performance of these materials in SSIBs is limited. With consideration of the direct implications on performance that surface chemistry has, understanding of this is paramount.\n Evaluation of the chemical evolution of the Na metal/NaSICON interface has been achieved through assessing the changes of the chemical landscape that take place at the surface and near-surface, through surface characterisation techniques that probe the area of interest at varying depths – X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). This has been conducted on samples that have been electrochemically cycled and comparison made to samples in pristine condition. The compositions used to conduct this investigation are Na3Zr2Si2PO12 and Na3.4Zr2Si2.4P0.6O12 – the latter of which has been shown to have one of the highest room temperature sodium-ion conductivity4. Through this, the electronic structure, and hence chemical state, can be deduced alongside a 3D chemical map that will correlate surface chemical changes with electrochemical performance. Thus, a preliminary means of understanding the fundamentals of chemical evolution can be established.\n \n References\n \n \n Lu, G. Xia, J. P. Lemmon, Z.

While intergranular dendritic lithium growth in inorganic solid electrolytes (SEs) has been extensively studied for lithium ASSBs, comparable knowledge is missing for sodium‐based ASSBs. Therefore, polycrystalline Na‐β″‐alumina is employed as a SE model material to investigate the microstructural influence on sodium filament growth during deposition of sodium metal at the anode. The research focuses on the relationship between the microstructure, in particular grain boundary (GB) type and orientation, sodium filament growth, and sodium ion transport, utilizing in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements in combination with crystal orientation analysis. The effect of the anisotropic sodium ion transport at/across GBs depending on the orientation of the sodium ion transport planes and the applied electric field on the current distribution and the position of sodium filament growth is explored. The in situ TEM analysis is validated by large field of view post‐mortem secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS) analysis, in which sodium filament growth within voids and along grain boundaries is observed, contributing to the sodium network formation potentially leading to failure of batteries.",

        "abstract": "Single-layer rhenium disulfide (ReS2) is a unique material with distinctive, anisotropic electronic, mechanical, and optical properties and has the potential to be used as an anode in alkali-metal-ion batteries. In this work, first principles calculations were performed to systematically evaluate the potential of monolayer pristine and defective ReS2 as anodes in lithium (Li)- and sodium (Na)-ion batteries. Our calculations suggest that there are several potential adsorption sites for Li and Na on pristine ReS2, owing to its low-symmetry structure. Additionally, the adsorption of Li and Na over pristine ReS2 is very strong with adsorption energies of -2.28 and -1.71 eV, respectively. Interestingly, the presence of point defects causes significantly stronger binding of the alkali-metal atoms with adsorption energies in the range -2.98 to -3.17 eV for Li and -2.66 to -2.92 eV for Na. Re single vacancy was found to be the strongest binding defect for Li adsorption, whereas S single vacancy was found to be the strongest for Na. The diffusion of these two alkali atoms over pristine ReS2 is anisotropic, with an energy barrier of 0.33 eV for Li and 0.16 eV for Na. The energy barriers associated with escaping a double vacancy and single vacancy for Li atoms are significantly large at 0.60 eV for the double-vacancy case and 0.51 eV for the single-vacancy case. Similarly, for Na, they are 0.59 and 0.47 eV, respectively, which indicates slower migration and sluggish charging/discharging. However, the diffusion energy barrier over a Re single vacancy is found to be merely 0.42 eV for a Li atom and 0.28 eV for Na. Overall, S single and double vacancies can reduce the diffusion rate by 103-105 times for Li and Na ions, respectively. These results suggest that monolayer ReS2 with a Re single vacancy adsorbs Li and Na stronger than pristine ReS2, with negligible negotiation with the charging/discharging rate of the battery, and therefore they can be used as an anode in Li- and Na-ion batteries.",

The metalation mechanism consists of highly unusual and previously only speculated Sn (III)-state grasped by operando Raman spectroelectrochemistry aided by symmetry analysis. The prepared 2D material flakes were characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopies. The operando Raman spectroelectrochemistry was chosen as a dedicated tool for the investigation of alkali-metal-ion intercalation (Li, Na, K), whereby the distortion of the A1g Raman active mode (out-of-plane S-Sn-S vibration) during battery charging exhibited a substantial dependence on the electrochemically applied potential. As a result of the structural dynamics a considerable Raman red-shift of 17.6 cm−1 was observed during metalation. Linewidth changes were used to evaluate the expansion caused by metalation, which in case of sodium and potassium were found to be minimal compared to lithium. Based on the spectroscopic and electrochemical results, a mechanism for the de-/intercalation of lithium, sodium and potassium is proposed which includes alloying in few-layer 2D SnS2 materials and the generation of point-defects.",

        "abstract": "A porous MA-VA-PcNi polymer was prepared by grafting nickel phthalocyanine (PcNi) onto the main chain of a maleic anhydride-vinyl acetate (MA-VA) polymer, and an MA-VA-PcNi electrode is prepared by electrospinning technology to inhibit the agglomeration of the active powder effectively, which produces spherical particles with a diameter of 100-300 nm. The synthesized MA-VA-PcNi polymer is used as the anode for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries, exhibiting excellent energy storage behaviors. The MA-VA-PcNi/Li battery displays a high capacity of 610 mA h g-1 and can still remain at 507 mA h g-1 with a retention rate of 83.1% after 400 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g-1. Even at a high current density of 2 A g-1, the specific capacity can remain at 195 mA h g-1. In addition, the MA-VA-PcNi/Na battery displays a high capacity of 336 mA h g-1 and can still remain at 278 mA h g-1 with a retention rate of 82.7% after 400 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g-1. A high specific capacity of 164 mA h g-1 can also be achieved at a high current density of 1 A g-1. After nickel phthalocyanine (PcNi) was grafted onto the MA-VA polymer, aggregation between phthalocyanine rings was effectively prevented, and this exposes more active sites. At the same time, the spherical particles obtained by electrospinning technology further improve the dispersion and increase the number of active sites of the active materials. Finally, the electrode materials show excellent energy storage behavior for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries, which provides a new idea for designing high-performance energy storage materials for organic electrodes.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have attracted widespread attention for cost-effective and large-scale electric energy storage. However, their practical deployment has been largely retarded by the lack of choice of efficient anode materials featuring large capacity and electrochemical stability and robustness. Herein, we report a durian-inspired design and template-free fabrication of a robust sodium electrode based on triangular pyramid arrays of Bi0.75Sb0.25 alloy electrodeposited on Cu substrates. The Bi0.75Sb0.25 arrays exhibit an appreciable electrochemical robustness for sodium storage, sustaining a reversible capability 335 mAh g-1 at a high rate of 2.5 A g-1, and 87% of the initial capacity over 2,000 cycles. We further demonstrate the applicability of the Bi0.75Sb0.25 array anode in sodium full cells by pairing it with a Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode. This full cell achieves a high specific energy of 203 Wh kg-1 (based on both active electrodes). Such an enhanced performance is attributed to the unique thorny-durian-like architecture and bimetallic alloy composition. The pyramid tip induces ion enrichment for rapid charge-transfer reaction, while the alloy design reduces the electrode volume swelling for stable Na cycling.",

However, commercial graphite anodes used in lithium-ion batteries are not suitable for SIBs, due to a difficult insertion of sodium ions into the graphitic layers. Possible anode candidates focus on hard carbons (HCs).

Regarding mild chemically activated HCs, the best material (exhibiting a 76% ICE and impressive reversible charge capacities of 354 and 77 mA h g–1 at 0.1 and 2 A g–1, respectively) was the carbon produced via hydrothermal preatretment in HCl aqueous solution and subsequently heated up to 1000 °C.

        "abstract": "Despite the high theoretical capacity, silicon (Si) anodes in lithium-ion batteries have difficulty in meeting the commercial standards in various aspects. In particular, the huge volume change of Si makes it very challenging to simultaneously achieve high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and long-term cycle life. Herein, we report spray pyrolysis to prepare Si-SiOx composite using an aqueous precursor solution containing Si nanoparticles, citric acid, and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). In the precursor solution, Si nanoparticles are etched by NaOH with the production of [SiO4]4-. During the dynamic course of spray pyrolysis, [SiO4]4- transforms to SiOx matrix and citric acid decomposes to carbon surface layer with the assistance of NaOH that serves as a decomposition catalyst. As a result, a Si-SiOx composite, in which Si nanodomains are homogeneously embedded in the SiOx matrix with carbon surface layer, is generated by a one-pot process with a residence time of only 3.5 s in a flow reactor. The optimal composite structure in terms of Si domain size and Si-to-O ratio exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, such as reversible capacity of 1561.9 mAh g-1 at 0.06C rate and ICE of 80.2% and 87.9% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1C rate.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon is considered the most commercially viable anode material for sodium ion batteries due to its excellent sodium storage properties. However, the production cost of hard carbon is high, so optimizing the electrochemical performance of coal-derived hard carbon is adopted. However, due to the dense structure of coal, it is difficult to prepare closed pores inside the coal-derived hard carbon, which is not conducive to increasing capacity. Therefore, we propose Zn2(OH)2CO3 assisted ball milling pretreatment followed by carbonization to generate closed pores in coal-derived hard carbon. The reason for the formation of closed pores is that the uniform pores on the coal surface generated by the wear and etching of Zn2(OH)2CO3 are repaired at high temperatures. Via mechanism characterization, we verified that the plateau capacity is related to the filling of sodium ions in closed pores. Therefore, the as-prepared coal-derived hard carbon delivers a high capacity of 325.3 mA h g−1 (plateau capacity accounting for 45.1%) at a current density of 0.03 A g−1 with a capacity retention rate of 83.5% over 500 cycles. This work has demonstrated that reasonable pore design is an effective strategy to improve the electrochemical sodium storage performance of coal-derived hard carbon, providing an effective approach for the high value-added utilization of coal.",

High capacity anode materials, such as phosphorus, have been explored to realize Na-ion battery technologies that offer comparable performances to their Li-ion counterparts. While P anodes provide unparalleled capacities, the mechanism of sodiation and desodiation is not well-understood, limiting further optimization. Here, we use a combined experimental and theoretical approach to provide molecular-level insight into the (de)sodiation pathways in black P anodes for sodium-ion batteries. A determination of the P binding in these materials was achieved by comparing to structure models created via species swapping, ab initio random structure searching, and a genetic algorithm. During sodiation, analysis of 31P chemical shift anisotropies in NMR data reveals P helices and P at the end of chains as the primary structural components in amorphous Na xP phases. X-ray diffraction data in conjunction with variable field 23Na magic-angle spinning NMR support the formation of a new Na3P crystal structure (predicted using density-functional theory) on sodiation. During desodiation, P helices are re-formed in the amorphous intermediates, albeit with increased disorder, yet emphasizing the pervasive nature of this motif. The pristine material is not re-formed at the end of desodiation and may be linked to the irreversibility observed in the Na-P system.",

        "abstract": "The enhancement of the structural stability of conversion-based metal sulfides at high current densities remains a major challenge in realizing the practical application of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The instability of metal sulfides is caused by the large volume variation and sluggish reaction kinetics upon sodiation/desodiation. To overcome this, herein, a heterostructured nanocube anode composed of CuS/FeS2 embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon (CuS/FeS2 @NC) is synthesized. Size- and shape-controlled porous carbon nanocubes containing metallic nanoparticles are synthesized by the two-step pyrolysis of a bimetallic Prussian blue analog (PBA) precursor. The simple sulfurization-induced formation of highly conductive CuS along with FeS2 facilitates sodium-ion diffusion and enhances the redox reversibility upon cycling.

The CuS/FeS2 @NC nanocube anode exhibits excellent sodium storage characteristics including high desodiation capacity (608 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 ), remarkable long-term cycle life (99.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 5 A g-1 ), and good rate capability up to 5 A g-1 .

However, the growth of anode dendrites and continuous side reactions during cycling limit the practical application of zinc ion batteries. In this paper, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was used as an aqueous electrolyte additive to improve the surface deposition of Zn2+. The experimental results show that the SDS electrolyte additive forms a protective layer on the anode surface through electrostatic action and inhibits the growth of dendritic protruding dendrites by increasing the zinc deposition overpotential, as well as by limiting the two-dimensional diffusion of Zn2+ on the negative electrode surface of the aqueous zinc ion battery. As a result, adding SDS improves the discharge specific capacity of NVP/Zn batteries at high voltages and results in improved capacity retention. The cycling stability of NVP/Zn batteries was greatly enhanced by using a battery containing 1% SDS that still had a discharge specific capacity of 71 mAh/g after 100 cycles at a charging current density of 1 C, with a capacity retention rate of 89%.

However, SnCl2·2H2O is not suitable for large-scale production due to its high price. Compared with SnCl2·2H2O, SnCl4·5H2O has a lower price, more stable chemical properties and better water solubility. Until now, there have been no related reports on the synthesis of SnS from SnCl4·5H2O. In this work, the fabrication of SnS/NG in a facile, two-step process, which combines a hot water bath and thermal annealing and uses SnCl4·5H2O as a precursor, is described. The mechanism of phase transformation in the direct synthesis of SnS from Sn4+ is also discussed in detail. Applying our methodology, SnS nanoparticles were grown in-situ on graphene sheets and wrapped by N-doped graphene sheets to form a 3D SnS/NG composite. With 35.35% content of graphene in the SnS/NG composite, the reversible specific capacity remained at 417.8 mAh/g at 1000 mA/g after 100 cycles, exhibiting a high specific capacity and good cycling stability. In addition, the composite also had an excellent rate performance, with a specific capacity of 366.9 mAh/g obtained even at 5000 mA/g. Meanwhile, the fast sodium storage kinetics of SnS/NG were also analyzed, providing some theoretical support for further study.",

        "abstract": "Biomass-derived hard carbon materials are attractive for sodium-ion batteries due to their abundance, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness. However, their widespread use is hindered by their limited specific capacity. Herein, a type of bamboo-derived hard carbon with adjustable pore structures is developed by employing a ball milling technique to modify the carbon chain length in the precursor. It is observed that the length of the carbon chain in the precursor can effectively control the rearrangement behavior of the carbon layers during the high-temperature carbonization process, resulting in diverse pore structures ranging from closed pores to open pores, which significantly impact the electrochemical properties. The optimized hard carbon with abundant closed pores exhibits a high specific capacity of 356 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1, surpassing that of bare hard carbon (243 mAh g-1) and hard carbon with abundant open pores (129 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1). However, the kinetic analysis reveals that hard carbon with open pores shows better sodium-ion diffusion kinetics, indicating that a balance between the closed and open pores should be considered. This research offers valuable insights into pore design and presents a promising approach for enhancing the performance of hard carbon anode materials derived from biomass precursors.",

        "abstract": "The attractive advantages of the Zn metal anode and water-based electrolyte, such as inherent safety and low cost, endow the zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) with great potential in the future energy storage market. However, the severe surface side reactions and dendrites affect the service lifespan and electrochemical performance of ZIBs. Herein, a bifunctional electrolyte additive, l-ascorbic acid sodium (LAA), has been added into ZnSO4 (ZSO) electrolyte (ZSO + LAA) to settle the above issues of ZIBs. On the one hand, the LAA additive tends to adsorb on the Zn anode surface to generate a H2O-resistive passivation layer, which can effectively isolate the H2O corrosion and regulate the Zn2+ ion 3D diffusion, thus inducing a uniform deposition layer. On the other hand, the strong adsorption capacity between LAA and Zn2+ can transform the solvated [Zn(H2O)6]2+ into [Zn(H2O)4LAA], thus reducing the coordinated H2O molecules and further suppressing side reactions. With this synergy effect, the Zn/Zn symmetric battery with the ZSO + LAA electrolyte can deliver a cycle life of 1200 h under 1 mA cm-2, and the Zn/Ti battery also presents an ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency of 99.16% under 1 mA cm-2, greatly superior to the batteries with the ZSO electrolyte. Additionally, the effectiveness of the LAA additive can be further verified in the Zn/MnO2 full battery and pouch cell.",

        "abstract": "Advancements in the development of fast-charging and long-lasting microstructured alloying anodes with high volumetric capacities are essential for enhancing the operational efficiency of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). These anodes, however, face challenges such as declined cyclability and rate capability, primarily due to mechanical degradation reduced by significant volumetric changes (over 252%) and slow kinetics of sodium-ion storage. Herein, we introduce a novel anode design featuring densely packed bismuth (Bi) embedded within highly conductive carbon microspheres to overcome the aforementioned challenges. Remarkably, the high loading Bi anode within carbon microspheres with a high tap density of 2.59 g cm-3 possesses significant mechanical strength exceeding 590 MPa and limits volume swelling of only 10.9% post-sodiation. This anode demonstrates a high volumetric capacity (908.3 mAh cm-3), ultrafast chargeability (200 A g-1, full charge/discharge in just 5.5 s), and outstanding cyclability over 12,000 cycles and maintains exceptional cycling stability even at -30 °C. The full cell paired with a Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode retains over 80% capacity after 600 cycles at 36 C, demonstrating a remarkable rate capability of 126 C (full charge/discharge in 28.6 s). Our comprehensive experimental evaluations and chemo-mechanical simulations shed light on the mechanisms underpinning the anode's superior performance. This development marks a significant advancement in the design of durable and fast-charging anodes for high-performance SIBs.",

Therefore, it is critical to develop new anode materials for SIBs for practical use. Here, heteroatom‐doped graphene with high doping levels and disordered structures is prepared using a simple and economical thermal process. The solvothermal‐derived graphene shows excellent performance as an anode material for SIBs. It exhibits a high reversible capacity of 380 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles at 100 mA g−1, excellent rate performance 217 mAh g−1 at 3200 mA g−1, and superior cycling performance at 2.0 A g−1 during 1000 cycles with negligible capacity fade.",

However, the choice of suitable anode materials is a key step in the application of SIBs. Here, a simple vacuum filtration method is reported to obtain a bimetallic heterojunction structure. The heterojunction exhibits better performance than any single-phase material in sodium storage. The results show that the electron rich Se site and the internal electric field generated by the electron transfer in the heterojunction structure can provide rich electrochemically active areas and effectively promote the electron transport during sodiation/desodiation. More attractively, the strong interfacial interaction in the interface on the one hand maintains the stability of the structure and on the other hand promotes the diffusion of electrons. The NiCoSex/CG heterojunction with a strong oxygen bridge exhibits a high reversible capacity of 338 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, and an ignorable capacity attenuation at 2 A g-1 for 2000 cycles. The flexible full battery still shows good reversibility and output stability under bending and crimping.

The anode consists of sodium titanium phosphate, whereas the cathode is spinel lithium manganese oxide. It has been reported that both materials can intercalate sodium and lithium ions depending on their availability in the electrolyte. This study aims to identify the dominant active species in “Saltwater Batteries” with dual-ion electrolyte. Therefore, cyclic voltammetry of single electrodes as well as full cell measurements are performed with electrolyte containing lithium sulfate, sodium sulfate or a mixture. Moreover, the study is complemented by ion analysis of the electrolyte, as well as X-ray diffraction of fresh and cycled electrodes at different states of charge. The results show that the cathode only (de)intercalates lithium ions, revealing that Li is the dominant active cathode species. The anode can react with both ions and undergoes a formation reaction accompanied by partial dissolution of sodium titanium phosphate. Nevertheless, cyclic voltammetry and full cell measurements indicate that lithium is also the dominant active species on the anode side. In conclusion, the dual-ion battery is dominated by lithium and shows a superior performance when removing sodium from electrolyte.",

Even at a higher current density of 1000 mA g-1, the composite can still retain a discharge capacity of 220 mA h g-1 after 2000 cycles.

        "title": "Well-ordered mesoporous Fe2O3/C composites as high performance anode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have attracted considerable attention in recent years. In order to promote the practical application of sodium-ion batteries, the electrochemical performances, such as specific capacity, reversibility, and rate capability of the anode materials, should be further improved. In this work, a Fe2O3/C composite with a well-ordered mesoporous structure is prepared via a facile co-impregnation method by using mesoporous silica SBA-15 as a hard template. When used as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries, the well-ordered mesoporous structure ensures fast mass transport kinetics. The presence of nano-sized Fe2O3 particles confined within the carbon walls significantly enhances the specific capacity of the composite. The carbon walls in the composite act not only as an active material contributing to the specific capacity, but also as a conductive matrix improving the cycling stability of Fe2O3 nanoparticles. As a result, the well-ordered mesoporous Fe2O3/C composite exhibits high specific capacity, excellent cycleability, and high rate capability. It is proposed that this simple co-impregnation method is applicable for the preparation of well-ordered mesoporous transition oxide/carbon composite electrode materials for high performance sodium-ion and lithium-ion batteries.",

        "title": "Honeycomb-kagome FSL-graphene: A carbon allotrope as an ultra-high capacity anode material for fast-rechargeable sodium-ion battery",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are promising candidates for large-scale energy storage due to the abundance and low cost of sodium. However, graphite, the primary anode for commercial lithium-ion batteries, cannot be applied to SIBs. Its two-dimensional (2D) counterpart graphene is also inactive toward Na ions because of the delocalized π-electron network. We propose an idea to tackle this problem by introducing kagome topology into the honeycomb lattice, creating localized electronic states for improving the Na storage performance. Herein, we design a form of 2D carbon allotrope (named FSL-graphene), consisting of a kagome and a honeycomb sublattice. It has excellent stability, which is confirmed by the superior cohesive energy, positive phonon modes, high thermal stability, and strong mechanical stability. FSL-graphene exhibits an ultra-high theoretical Na storage capacity of 3347.1 mA h g−1, superior to most previously reported 2D anode materials. In addition, it possesses low diffusion energy barriers (0.19–0.23 eV), low open-circuit voltages (0.59–0.61 V), and small changes in lattice constants (1.3%). Furthermore, the electrolytes with high dielectric constants (e.g., ethylene carbonate) could improve the adsorption and migration of Na on FSL-graphene. This study provides an insight for designing high-performance carbon anode materials for SIBs by focusing on the topological lattices.",

        "abstract": "\n Biomass carbon, as a renewable resource, has the ability to be a hard carbon anode material for sodium-ion batteries. Its performance is highly reliant on the surface functional group. Through our work, we successfully synthesized the high-performance hard carbon by the treatment of the hydrogen reduction process of rose willow. Moreover, the effects of hydrogen reduction on the evolution of functional groups and the relevant electrochemical performance have been investigated. After undergoing hydrogen reduction treatment, the hard carbons' surface features and layer spacing were greatly enhanced. In addition, the partial surface C=O group was reduced to C-O, which led to the Na+ adsorption active sites and pseudo-capacity increased, thus improving the dynamics of the electrode process. As anticipated, the resulting hard carbon exhibited a capacity of 325 mAh g-1, with an initial coulomb efficiency of 80.84%. This study is in an effort to demonstrate the possibility of biomass-based carbon materials in preparation for future commercial applications of sodium-ion batteries.",

        "title": "Microwave-Assisted Hydrothermal Synthesis of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 Nanocuboid@Reduced Graphene Oxide as an Ultrahigh-Rate and Superlong-Lifespan Cathode for Fast-Charging Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) has been regarded as a favorable cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high voltage and stable structure. However, the limited electronic conductivity restricts its rate performance. NVPF@reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was synthesized by a facile microwave-assisted hydrothermal approach with subsequent calcination to shorten the hydrothermal time. NVPF nanocuboids with sizes of 50-150 nm distributed on rGO can be obtained, delivering excellent electrochemical performance such as a longevity life (a high capacity retention of 85.6% after 7000 cycles at 10 C) and distinguished rate capability (116 mAh g-1 at 50 C with a short discharging/charging time of 1.2 min). The full battery with a Cu2Se anode represents a capacity of 116 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1. The introduction of rGO can augment the electronic conductivity and advance the Na+ diffusion speed, boosting the cycling and rate capability. Besides, the small lattice change (3.3%) and high structural reversibility during the phase transition process between Na3V2(PO4)2F3 and NaV2(PO4)2F3 testified by in situ X-ray diffraction are also advantageous for Na storage behavior. This work furnishes a simple method to synthesize polyanionic cathodes with ultrahigh rate and ultralong lifespan for fast-charging SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Electrolytes as an important part of sodium-ion batteries have a pivotal role for capacity, rate, and durability of electrode materials. On account of the high reduction activity of sodium metal with organic solvents, it is very important to optimize the electrolyte component to realize high stability on Na metal and hard carbon anodes. Herein, chemical and electrochemical stability of propylene carbonate (PC)-based electrolytes on sodium metal and hard carbon anodes is investigated systematically. The results demonstrate that whether using NaClO4 or NaPF6, the PC-based electrolytes are not stable on Na metal, but adding of FEC can immensely enhance the stability of the electrolyte because of the compact solid electrolyte interphase film formed. The electrolytes containing FEC also exhibit high electrochemical compatibility on hard carbon anodes, showing high reversible capacity and excellent cycling performance. A reaction mechanism based on the Na+ induction effect is proposed by spectrum and electrochemical measurements. This study can provide a new insight to optimize and develop stable PC-based electrolytes and be helpful for understanding the other electrolyte systems.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries, but the performance remains unsatisfactory and the sodiation mechanism in HC is one of the most debated topics. Here, from self-assembled cellulose nanocrystal sheets with crystallographic texture, unique HC nanosheets with vertically oriented (002) planes are fabricated and used as a model HC to investigate the sodiation mechanisms using synchrotron scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) coupled with analytical transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The model HC simplifies the 3D sodiation in a typical HC particle into a 2D sodiation, which facilitates the visualization of phase transformation at different states of charge. The results for the first time unveil that the sodiation in HC initiates heterogeneously, with multiple propagation fronts proceeding simultaneously, eventually merging into larger aggregates. The spatial correlation between the preferential adsorption and nucleation sites suggests that the heterogeneous nucleation is driven by the local Na-ion concentration, which is determined by defects or heteroatoms that have strong binding to Na ions. By identifying intercalation as the dominant sodium storage mechanism in the model HC, the findings highlight the importance of engineering the graphene layer orientation and the structural heterogeneity of edge sites to enhance the performances.",

The thus-fabricated composites exhibited excellent Coulombic efficiency, a remarkable rate capability and an exceptionally long cycle life when being utilized as the anode in SIBs. Specifically, a reversible capacity of 265 mAh g−1 was achieved at 20 A g−1, which could be maintained for 6400 cycles. At an ultra-high rate of 30.0 A g−1, the anode retained a capacity of 235 mAh g−1 after 9500 cycles. Such a strong performance was attributed to its unique porous structure and synergistic interactions of multi-components. The underlying sodium storage mechanism was further investigated through various techniques such as in situ X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, the galvanostatic intermittent titration method, etc. Overall, this study illustrates the great potential of clad-structured multicomponent hybrids in developing high-performance SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium metal is a propitious anode for the development of next generation metal batteries owing to its low reduction potential (-2.71 V) and high theoretical capacity (1165 mAh g-1)1. Among various electrolytes, carbonate solvents can be useful to develop high voltage metal batteries with wide temperature range2. However, the aggressive reactivity of sodium metal in carbonate electrolytes lead to the formation of unstable solid electrolyte interface on the metal anode which renders poor long cycling performance to the battery3. In this work, we have fabricated thin and inorganic components (F and B rich) rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on Na metal anode and cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) on oxide-based cathode to improve long cycling stability of sodium metal battery. Here, fluorine (F) and boron (B) containing anion is compared with conventional hexafluorophosphate anion (PF6-) in binary carbonate solvent system (EC:EMC). The stable stripping/plating behaviour of both symmetric (Na/Na) and asymmetric cell (Al/Na) in case of F and B containing anion is found compared to the PF6\n - anion.\n The excellent long-term cycling stability of full cell (Na/Na0.67Fe0.5Mn0.5O2) is further attributed to the improved electrochemical stability window and better aluminium passivation on employing F and B containing anion in the electrolyte system as compared to PF6\n - anion. The dual role of F and B containing anion to form stable interfaces on both the anode and cathode side provides a pathway in the development of fluorinated electrolytes for high voltage sodium metal batteries.\n References:\n (1) Yang, T.; Luo, D.; Liu, Y.; Yu, A.; Chen, Z.

        "abstract": "The SALT battery (ZEBRA® battery) was first patented in 1978, and its technology is based on a liquid sodium (Na) anode in charged state, and a solid nickel (Ni) cathode in discharged state, having an electrolyte consisting of a molten nickel chloride/sodium chloride with sodium tetrachloroaluminate (NiCl2/NaCl-NaAlCl4) salt and a solid beta alumina (β''-Al2O3) electrolyte. The Na-NiCl2 cell operates at ~300°C to ensure a molten electrolyte and good Na+ conductivity, as the β''-Al2O3 also operates as a membrane allowing the Na+ ions to pass, but not the e-.\n Today, the technology is commercialized, and industrial production sites exist in Switzerland and China. The SALT batteries are used for railways as a back-up energy supply, and in electric vehicles for the mining and construction market. The Na current collector is also the cell housing, making sure that the SALT battery cell is completely hermitized to avoid any contact with air and humidity, as the electrolyte is hygroscopic salts. It is, however, important to reduce the amount of Critical Raw Materials (CRMs) utilizing more abundant materials to make it more competitive for future markets.\n In the SOLSTICE project, it has been investigated how the SALT battery can reduce and/or substitute Ni/NiCl2 with Zn/ZnCl2. The present work has covered characterization of a tubular Na-ZnCl2 battery cell, and measured the cell resistance by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), cell resistance when fully charged and discharged, as well as the post-mortem analyses, such as SEM and XRD. The study proved that Ni can be replaced by Zn in the full-size SALT battery cell, but the morphology still needs to be studied to optimize the chemistry.\n \n Acknowledgments: This work has been funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No. 963599.",

        "abstract": "High theoretical capacity and low-cost copper sulfide (CuxS)-based anodes have gained great attention for advanced sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, their practical application may be hindered due to their unstable cycling performance and problems with the dissolution of sodium sulfides (NaxS) into electrolyte. Here, we employed metal organic framework (MOF-199) as a sacrificial template to fabricate nanoporous CuxS with a large surface area embedded in the MOF-derived carbon network (CuxS-C) through a two-step process of sulfurization and carbonization via H2S gas-assisted plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) processing. Subsequently, we uniformly coated a nanocarbon layer on the Cu1.8S-C through hydrothermal and subsequent annealing processes. The physico-chemical properties of the nanocarbon layer were revealed by the analytical techniques of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We acquired a higher SIB performance (capacity retention (~93%) with a specific capacity of 372 mAh/g over 110 cycles) of the nanoporous Cu1.8S-C/C core/shell anode materials than that of pure Cu1.8S-C. This encouraging SIB performance is attributed to the key roles of a nanocarbon layer coated on the Cu1.8S-C to accommodate the volume variation of the Cu1.8S-C anode structure during cycling, enhance electrical conductivity and prevent the dissolution of NaxS into the electrolyte. With these physico-chemical and electrochemical properties, we ensure that the Cu1.8S-C/C structure will be a promising anode material for large-scale and advanced SIBs.",

While carbon matrices have demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing the electrical conductivity and accommodating the volume expansion of transition metal oxide-based anode materials in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), achieving an optimized utilization ratio remains a challenging obstacle. In this investigation, we have devised a straightforward synthesis approach to fabricate CuO nano powder integrated with carbon matrix. We found that with the use of a sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) based binder and fluoroethylene carbonate additives, this anode exhibits enhanced performance compared to acrylonitrile multi-copolymer binder (LA133) based electrodes. CuO@CMC electrodes reveal a notable capacity ~1100 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 following 170 cycles, and exhibit prolonged cycling stability, with a capacity of 450 mA h g−1 at current density 300 mA g−1 over 500 cycles.

However, the integration of such two type materials and the relevant sodium storage applications remain daunting challenges. Here, an ingenious diatomite‐templated synthetic strategy is designed to fabricate single‐atom cobalt‐doped MoS2/carbon (SA Co‐MoS2/C) composites toward the high‐performance sodium storage. Benefiting from the unique hierarchical structure, high electron/sodium‐ion conductivity, and abundant active sites, the obtained SA Co‐MoS2/C reveals remarkable specific capacity (≈604.0 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1), high rate performance, and outstanding long cyclic stability. Particularly, the sodium‐ion full cell composed of SA Co‐MoS2/C anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode demonstrates unexpected stability with the cycle number exceeded 1200. The internal sodium storage mechanism is clarified with the aid of density functional theory calculations and in situ experimental characterizations.

        "abstract": "The global availability of sodium makes the exploration of superior sodium-ion batteries attractive for energy storage application. MXenes, as one of the most promising anodes for sodium-ion batteries, have been reported to have many advantages, such as high electronic conductivity and a hydrophilic surface. However, the compact multilayer structure and deficient delamination significantly inhibits their application, requiring high energy and showing decreased storage capacity and poor rate capabilities. Few-layer MXene has been proved to benefit superior electrochemical properties with a better ionic conductivity and two-dimensional layer structure. Herein, we report scale delamination of few-layer MXene nanosheets as anodes for sodium-ion batteries, which are prepared via an organic solvent assist high-energy mechanical-milling method. This approach efficiently prevents the oxidation of MXene and produces few-layer nanosheets structure, facilitating fast electron transport and Na+ diffusion. Electrochemical tests demonstrate that the few-layer MXenes show high specific capacity, excellent cycle stability, and good rate performance. Specifically, few-layer MXene nanosheets deliver a high reversible capacity of 267 mA h g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1. After cycling 1500 cycles at a high rate of 1 A g-1, a reversible capacity of 76 mA h g-1 could be maintained.",

Unfortunately, current safety issue associated with conventional LIBs originates from the use of flammable liquid electrolytes. Therefore, solid-state batteries (SSBs) using solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) as a potential candidate can address the safety concerns and revive the lithium metal to further increase the energy density of batteries. Among several types of SSEs such as ceramic electrolytes, solid polymer electrolytes, and composite solid electrolytes (CSEs), CSEs are more attractive by combining the advantages of both ceramic and polymer electrolytes. However, CSEs still suffer from insufficient ionic conductivity at room temperature to meet the requirement for high-performance electrolytes. In this study, 3D ceramic porous framework as a continuous lithium-ion conduction pathway as well as a backbone for in-situ polymer penetration was prepared to overcome the challenge. The synergistic effect of the 3D continuous framework, well-organized polymer, and their interphase enabled high-performance SSEs.

        "abstract": "Sodiophilic micro‐composite films of sodium‐chalcogenide intermetallics (Na2Te and Na2S) and Cu particles are fabricated onto commercial copper foam current collectors (Na2Te@CF and Na2S@CF). For the first time a controllable capacity thermal infusion process is demonstrated. Enhanced wetting by the metal electrodeposition leads to state‐of‐the‐art electrochemical performance. For example, Na2Te@CF‐based half‐cells demonstrate stable cycling at 6 mA cm−2 and 6 mAh cm−2, corresponding to 54 µm of Na electrodeposited/electrodissolved by geometric area. Sodium metal batteries with Na3V2 (PO4)3 cathodes are stable at 30C (7 mA cm−2) and for 10 000 cycles at 5C and 10C. Cross‐sectional cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo‐FIB) microscopy details deposited and remnant dissolved microstructures. Sodium metal electrodeposition onto Na2Te@CF is dense, smooth, and free of dendrites or pores. On unmodified copper foam, sodium grows in a filament‐like manner, not requiring cycling to achieve this geometry. Substrate–metal interaction critically affects the metal–electrolyte interface, namely the thickness and morphology of the solid electrolyte interphase. Density functional theory and mesoscale simulations provide insight into support‐adatom energetics, nucleation response, and early‐stage morphological evolution. On Na2Te sodium atomic dispersion is thermodynamically more stable than isolated clusters, leading to conformal adatom coverage of the surface.",

        "abstract": "The design of sodium ion batteries is proposed based on the use of flexible membrane composed of ultrasmall transition metal oxides. In this paper, the preparation of CuO quantum dots (≈2 nm) delicately embedded in carbon nanofibers (denoted as 2-CuO@C) with a thin film via a feasible electrospinning method is reported. The CuO content can be controlled by altering the synthetic conditions and is optimized to 54 wt%. As binder-free anode for sodium ion batteries, 2-CuO@C delivers an initial reversible capacity of 528 mA h g-1 at the current density of 100 mA g-1 , an exceptional rate capability of 250 mA h g-1 at 5000 mA g-1 , and an ultra-stable capacity of 401 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 500 mA g-1 . The enhancement of electrochemical performance is attributed to the unique structure of 2-CuO@C, which offers a variety of advantages: highly conductive carbon matrix suppressing agglomeration of CuO grains, interconnected nanofibers ensuring short transport length for electrons, well-dispersed CuO quantum dots leading to highly utilization rate, and good mechanical properties resulting in strong electrode integrity.",

        "title": "Ion Flux Regulation through PTFE Nanospheres Impregnated in Glass Fiber Separators for Long‐Lived Lithium and Sodium Metal Batteries",
        "abstract": "Practical implementation of alkali metal batteries currently still faces formidable challenges because of the dendrite growth upon continuous charge/discharge processes and the associated unstable solid–electrolyte interphase. Herein, it is reported that dendrites can be fundamentally mitigated in lithium and sodium metal batteries by regulating the Li+ and Na+ flux using a glass fiber (GF) separator impregnated with polytetrafluoroethylene nanospheres (PTFE‐NSs), which results in homogeneous deposition of Li and Na during charging. The COMSOL Multiphysics simulations reveal that the introduction of negatively charged PTFE‐NSs into the GF separator enhances the local electric field near the anode, thereby boosting the transfer of cations. It is demonstrated that Li//Li and Na//Na symmetric cells utilising a PTFE‐GF separator show outstanding cycle stability of 1245 and 2750 h, respectively, at 0.5 mA cm−2. Moreover, the Li//LiFePO4 and Na//Na3V2(PO4)2F3 full cells exhibit remarkably improved capacity retention when cycled at 1 C, in the presence of a PTFE‐GF separator. The nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies suggest that the impregnation of PTFE‐NSs into GF helps “liberate” more Li+ and Na+ and changes the coordination interaction between ions and solvents, contributing to the enhanced electrochemical performance.",

        "title": "Regulating Ion-Dipole Interactions in Weakly Solvating Electrolyte towards Ultra-Low Temperature Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are recognized as promising energy storage devices. However, they suffer from rapid capacity decay at ultra-low temperatures due to high Na+ desolvation energy barrier and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, a weakly solvating electrolyte (WSE) with decreased ion-dipole interactions is designed for stable sodium storage in hard carbon (HC) anode at ultra-low temperatures. 2-methyltetrahydrofuran with low solvating power is incorporated into tetrahydrofuran to regulate the interactions between Na+ and solvents. The reduced Na+-dipole interactions facilitate more anionic coordination in the first solvation sheath, which consistently maintains anion-enhanced solvation structures from room to low temperatures to promote inorganic-rich SEI formation. These enable WSE with a low freezing point of -83.3°C and faster Na+ desolvation kinetics. The HC anode thus affords reversible capacities of 243.2 and 205.4 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 at -40 and -60°C, respectively, and the full cell of HC||Na3V2(PO4)3 yields an extended lifespan over 250 cycles with high capacity retention of ~100% at -40°C.

Driven by the promising ionic conductivities of Na3PS4, here we explore the stability and viability of Na3PS4 as a solid electrolyte against metallic Na and compare it to that of Na-β″-Al2O3 (sodium β-alumina). As expected, Na-β″-Al2O3 is stable against sodium, whereas Na3PS4 decomposes with an increasing overall resistance, making Na-β″-Al2O3 the electrolyte of choice for protected sodium anodes and all-solid-state batteries.",

        "title": "Development of Lithium/Sodium-Ion Battery Electrodes Based on Solvent Engineered Tin(II) Oxide Nanomaterials",
        "abstract": "With the global economy pushing towards a greener and cleaner energy future for the world, renewable energy storage technologies must continue to develop and improve to allow for a seamless transition from the ways of the past to a carbon neutral future. To this end, renewable battery technology and in particular the capacity of the anode must be improved. Furthermore this improvement must be made across various battery technologies (Lithium/Sodium-ion) and be cost-effective to allow for its widespread implementation and use worldwide.\n In this work, Tin(II) Oxide (SnO)/single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) composite electrodes are analysed as a possible alternative dual anode material for both lithium (LIB) and sodium-ion batteries (NIB). The LIB is limited by the current commercial anode material of graphite with a relatively low theoretical capacity of 372 mAh g-1 whilst NIBs use hard carbon with a capacity of roughly 300 mAh g-1. Alloy/de-alloy materials are envisioned to be a suitable candidate for next generation LIBs/NIBs due to their large specific capacities (875mAh g-1/ 847 mAh g-1 for SnO respectively) although major drawbacks concern the poor cycling life associated with the volume change and the associated irreversible capacity. To overcome such issues the downsizing of materials and the fabrication of composites which incorporate both lithium active and inactive material are viewed as promising solutions. Nanostructured metal oxides, forming an inactive oxide matrix are appealing candidates.\n Through the implementation of a solvent engineered wet chemistry synthesis, various layered SnO microparticles are produced with several morphologies well-suited to energy storage applications. This synthesis method is facile, scalable and is favourable in comparison to hydrothermal synthesese normally used to synthesise nanomaterials. While SWCNTs are themselves not suited towards energy storage applications, their incorporation in the electrodes allows them to act as a conductive additive at a lower weight loading than other conventional carbon sources (carbon black/graphite), presenting a more effective strategy to form an effective electrical percolation network while also removing the need for polymer binders/copper current collector.\n The optimised morphology of SnO produces a high capacity, high rate and stable anode for LIB technology. An initial coloumbic efficiency (ICE) in excess of 80% is recorded and a stable cycling capacity of 815 mAh g-1 at 0.5C after 300 cycles is also achieved, demonstrating its long term stability. A maximum capacity of 980 mAh g-1 is recorded at 0.1C, whilst high rate capacities of 775, 671 and 364 mAh g-1 are recorded at 1,2 and 5C respectively. Furthermore a full-cell is composed with a NMC cathode to demonstrate a potential full-cell real world device. As an NIB anode, a maximum capacity of 568 mAh g-1 was recorded at 0.05C, whilst a low ICE of 50% proves an issue under further investigation. Furthermore a cycling capacity of 595 mAh g-1 is recorded after 50 cycles at 0.1C, dropping to 360 mAh g-1 at 100 cycles which is still in excess of that recorded for hard carbon in NIBs.\n A high capacity, scalable and cost effective anode has been developed that is interchangeable between LIBs/NIBs and exceeds the performance of the current commercial anodes.\n \n Reference\n s\n :\n \n \n [1] S.

A low-cost Na-K alloy is liquid at 25 °C from 9.2 to 58.2 wt% of sodium; sodium and/or potassium can be plated dendrite-free in the liquid range at room temperature. The co-existence of two alkali metals in an anode raises a question: whether the liquid Na-K alloy acts as a Na or a K anode. Here we show the alkali-metal that is stripped from the liquid Na-K anode is dependent on the preference of the cathode host. It acts as the anode of a sodium rechargeable cell if the cathode host structure selectively accepts only Na+ ions; as the anode of a potassium rechargeable cell if the cathode accepts K+ ions in preference to Na+ ions. This dual-anode behavior means the liquid Na-K alkali-alloy can be applied as a dendrite-free anode in Na-metal batteries as well as K-metal batteries.",

        "abstract": "Aqueous zinc ion batteries have shown great potential for large‐scale energy storage systems and have attracted widespread market interest. However, side reactions such as passivation of zinc anode hinder its further development towards practical applications. In this paper, sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate (SDBS) was used as an aqueous electrolyte additive to improve the cycling performance. The experimental results show that SDBS can form a stable protective film on the electrode surface, inhibit the formation and growth of zinc dendrites, and reduce the side reactions of the electrolyte, thus improving the electrochemical performance of the battery. The application of SDBS as an electrolyte additive in Na3V2(PO4)3/Zn (NVP/Zn) full batteries significantly improves the cycling performance and the Coulombic efficiency of the batteries, inhibits the occurrence of the side reactions, and slows down the decay of the reversible specific capacity. The NVP/Zn full cell with the addition of SDBS achieved 81% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.5C magnification, and the cell polarization was significantly reduced. This work provides a simple and feasible method for aqueous zinc ion batteries to reduce polarization and increase the diffusion rate of Zn2+.",

        "abstract": "The metal anode is the pivotal component for advanced sodium‐metal batteries such as Na–O2 batteries. Designing a 3D confinement scaffold is a promising strategy for constructing dendrite‐free sodium‐metal anodes; however, cycling stability at a large current density (>10 mA cm−2) is still difficult to realize. Herein, the design of new lightweight and fibrous hydroxylated Ti3C2 (h‐Ti3C2) MXene based scaffolds with stepped sodiophilic gradient structure (h‐M‐SSG) is reported, and its thickness can be controlled (80−250 µm). The sodiophilic gradient structure (adjusted by h‐Ti3C2) can effectively induce sodium ions to preferentially deposit at the bottom of the scaffold, thus inhibiting dendrite growth. h‐M‐SSG/Na‐based symmetrical batteries exhibit a low polarization voltage and long cycling life at a high current density (40 mA cm−2) and a high cut‐off capacity (40 mAh cm−2). Moreover, a Na–O2 battery with an h‐M‐SSG/Na anode exhibits a low potential gap of 0.137 V after 45 cycles at 1000 mA g−1 and 1000 mAh g−1. This deposition‐regulation strategy would inspire the design of 3D scaffolds for high‐performance sodium‐metal‐anode‐based batteries.",

To address these issues, herein, SnO2 quantum dots (≈5 nm) embedded in porous N-doped carbon matrix (SnO2 /NC) are developed via a hydrothermal step combined with a self-polymerization process at room temperature. The ultrasmall size in quantum dots can greatly shorten the ion diffusion distance and lower the internal strain, improving the conversion reaction efficiency and coulombic efficiency. The rich mesopores/micropores and highly conductive N-doped carbon matrix can further enhance the overall conductivity and buffer effect of the composite. As a result, the optimized SnO2 /NC-2 composite for LIBs exhibits a high coulombic efficiency of 72.9%, a high discharge capacity of 1255.2 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles and a long life-span with a capacity of 753 mAh g-1 after 1500 cycles at 1 A g-1 . The SnO2 /NC-2 composite also displays excellent performance for SIBs, delivering a superior discharge capacity of 212.6 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 3000 cycles.

        "abstract": "Composite cathodes have attracted great attentions due to the integrated advantages of each pure structure. And the component ratio deserves a carefully modulation to further improve the corresponding electrochemical performance. Mn-based layer-tunnel hybrid composite became a focus in sodium ion batteries due to the supe-riority in high performance, low cost and non-toxicity. In the previous reports, the structure modulation was car-ried out via changing the synthesis condition, varying the transition metal element ratio, and different ion doping. And it is still challenging to explore a more feasible method to simplify the adjustment process. Herein, we intro-duced Mg2+ into Na sites or transition metal sites in Na0.6MnO2 and firstly discovered the doping-sites variation induced structure adjustment phenomenon. Specifically, Mg doping in transition metal sites could be beneficial for the growth of the P2-type structure while layer/tunnel component ratio decreased when locating Mg2+ in Na sites. The P2-O2 phase transformations could be effectively suppressed by locating Mg2+ in both sites could the in high voltage regions and thus improve cycling performance. The designed material, Na0.6Mn0.99Mg0.01O2, could attain a decent capacity of 100 mA h g-1 at 1000 mA g-1 and a satisfied retention of 76.6 % after 500 cycles. Ad-ditionally, ex situ XRD experiments verify the excellent structural stability of Mg-substituted samples during charge-discharge processes. Moreover, the Na0.6Mn0.99Mg0.01O2 also displays superior sodium-ion full-cell proper-ties when merged with hard carbon anode.

Organic anode materials are potential for efficient SIBs because they are not sensitive to the size of metal ions. Yet they still suffer from shortcomings such as low electrical conductivity, and solubility in electrolyte. Formation of nanocomposite with carbon materials is an efficient way to address these issues. Herein, we design a thiophene-based carboxylate compound STT, and the STT@rGO nanocomposite is also in situ formed as anode material for SIBs. The reduced graphene oxide (rGO) could improve conductivity and decrease the solubility of the anode material. Compared to the pristine STT electrode, STT@rGO delivers a reversible specific capacity of 178 mAh g-1, with a capacity retention rate of 86% after 1000 cycles. Moreover, full batteries are successfully assembled using the nanocomposite anode and the commercial cathode Na3V2(PO4)3, manifesting the potential applications of the nanocomposite as organic electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "Organic electrode materials with the advantages of renewability, environment-friendliness, low cost, and high capacity have received widespread attention in recent years for sodium-ion batteries. However, small molecular organic materials suffer from issues such as low conductivity and the high dissolution rate in electrolytes. Herein, a phthalocyanine derivative (TPcDS) with a large non-localized π-electron system, obtained through thermodynamic polymerization of 4-aminophthalonitrile (AP) monomers, is designed to address these issues. According to the density function theory calculation, six sodium ions can be attracted by one polymer molecule, indicating a high theoretical capacity of 375 mA h g-1 . The TPcDS molecule realizes sodium storage through a non-localized π-electron system of phthalocyanine macrocycles. When employed as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries, the functional groups of phthalocyanine macrocycles, such as CN groups in TPcDS, experience obviously reversible structural variation upon discharge/charge. A high reversible capacity of 364 mAh g-1 is achieved at a current density of 0.05 A g-1 , and a charge capacity of as high as 246 mAh g-1 is still maintained after 500 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 . This work provides an effective strategy for the design and synthesis of new oligomeric organic electrode materials.",

Meanwhile, the introduction of N-doping from porous carbon into MPOC prolongs the cycle life. When use red phosphorus (RP) as active materials, the MPOC@RP anode exhibited high-capacity output (2454.3 and 2408.1 mAh g-1 in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) at 0.1 C) and long cycle life (the decay rates per cycle of 0.028% and 0.036% after 1500 and 1200 cycles at 2 C in LIBs and SIBs respectively). The successful application in RP anodes displays great potential in other electrode materials such as silicon, sulfur, selenium, and so on.

        "abstract": "Highly crystalline CuFeS2 containing earth-abundant and environmentally friendly elements prepared via a high-temperature synthesis exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance as an anode material in sodium-ion batteries. The initial specific capacity of 460 mAh g-1 increases to 512 mAh g-1 in the 150th cycle and then decreases to a still very high value of 444 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 in the remaining 550 cycles. Even for a large current density, a pronounced cycling stability is observed. Here, we demonstrate that combining the results of X-ray powder diffraction experiments, pair distribution function analysis, and 23Na NMR and Mössbauer spectroscopy investigations performed at different stages of discharging and charging processes allows elucidation of very complex reaction mechanisms. In the first step after uptake of 1 Na/CuFeS2, nanocrystalline NaCuFeS2 is formed as an intermediate phase, which surprisingly could be recovered during charging. On increasing the Na content, Cu+ is reduced to nanocrystalline Cu, while nanocrystalline Na2S and nanosized elemental Fe are formed in the discharged state. After charging, the main crystalline phase is NaCuFeS2. At the 150th cycle, the mechanisms clearly changed, and in the charged state, nanocrystalline CuxS phases are observed. At later stages of cycling, the mechanisms are altered again: NaF, Cu2S, and Cu7.2S4 appeared in the discharged state, while NaF and Cu5FeS4 are observed in the charged state. In contrast to a typical conversion reaction, nanocrystalline phases play the dominant role, which are responsible for the high reversible capacity and long-term stability.",

        "abstract": "Layered sodium transition-metal (TM) oxides generally suffer from severe capacity decay and poor rate performance during cycling, especially at a high state of charge (SoC). Herein, an insight into failure mechanisms within high-voltage layered cathodes is unveiled, while a two-in-one tactic of charge localization and coherent structures is devised to improve structural integrity and Na+ transport kinetics, elucidated by density functional theory calculations. Elevated Jahn-Teller [Mn3+O6] concentration on the particle surface during sodiation, coupled with intense interlayer repulsion and adverse oxygen instability, leads to irreversible damage to the near-surface structure, as demonstrated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and in situ characterization techniques. It is further validated that the structural skeleton is substantially strengthened through the electronic structure modulation surrounding oxygen. Furthermore, optimized Na+ diffusion is effectively attainable via regulating intergrown structures, successfully achieved by the Zn2+ inducer. Greatly, good redox reversibility with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 92.6%, impressive rate capability (86.5 mAh g-1 with 70.4% retention at 10C), and enhanced cycling stability (71.6% retention after 300 cycles at 5C) are exhibited in the P2/O3 biphasic cathode.

Two typical classes of materials including transition metal oxides and polyanion compounds have been under intensive investigation as cathodes for SIBs; however, they are still limited to poor stability or low capacity of the state-of-art. Herein, we report a low cost carbon-coated Na2FeSiO4 with simultaneous high capacity and good stability, owing to the highly pure Na-rich triclinic phase and the carbon-incorporated three-dimensional network morphology. The present carbon-coated Na2FeSiO4 demonstrates the highest reversible capacity of 181.0 mAh g-1 to date with multielectron redox reaction that occurred among various polyanion-based SIBs cathodes, which achieves a close-to-100% initial Coulombic efficiency and a stable cycling with 88% capacity retention up to 100 cycles. In addition, such an electrode shows excellent stability either charged at a high voltage of 4.5 V or heated up to 800 °C.

Still, the structure instability originating from irreversible oxygen redox at high voltage remains a challenge. Here, a high sustainability cobalt-free P2-Na0.72 Mn0.75 Li0.24 X0.01 O2  (X = Ti/Si) cathode is developed. The outstanding capacity retention and voltage retention after 150 cycles are obtained in half-cells. The finding shows that Ti localizes on the surface while Si diffuses to the bulk of the particles. Thus, Ti can act as a protective layer that alleviates side reactions in carbonate-based electrolyte. Meanwhile, Si can regulate the local electronic structure and suppress oxygen redox activities. Notably, full-cells with hard carbon (≈300-335 W h kg-1 based on the cathode mass) deliver the capacity retention of 83% for P2-Na0.72 Mn0.75 Li0.24 Si0.01 O2  and 66% for P2-Na0.72 Mn0.75 Li0.24 Ti0.01 O2  after 500 cycles; this electrochemical stability is the best compared to other reported cathodes based on oxygen redox at present. The superior cycle performance also stems from the ability to inhibit microcracking and planar gliding within the particles. Altogether, this finding offers a new composition for developing high-performance low-cost cathodes for NIBs and highlights the unique role of Ti/Si ions.",

Nevertheless, the unsatisfied cyclic stability and degraded rate capability at low temperatures due to sluggish ionic migration and poor conductivity become the main challenges. Herein, excellent sodium storage performance for the NVP cathode can be received by partial potassium (K) substitution and multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) cross-linking to modify the ionic diffusion and electronic conductivity. Consequently, the as-fabricated Na3-xKxV2(PO4)3@C/MWCNT can maintain a capacity retention of 79.4% after 2000 cycles at 20 C.

Generally, the improved electronic conductivity and modified ionic diffusion kinetics resulting from K doping and MWCNT interconnecting endows the resultant Na3-xKxV2(PO4)3@C/MWCNT with modified electrochemical polarization and improved redox reversibility, contributing to superior performance at low temperatures.

Yet, challenges arise due to irreversible reactions and the shuttle effect in contact with electrolytes. This study addresses these issues by confining Se within a microporous carbon derived from non-recyclable plastic waste through a two-step carbonization/activation process. The resulting plastic waste-derived carbon (PWC) serves as a host for Se, forming cathode composites through a melt diffusion process. The cathode electrode was fabricated using a slurry casting method, comprising PWC/Se composite, carbon black, and sodium alginate (8:1:1 mass ratio). The evolution of the porous structure in PWC and its impact on the electrochemical performance of PWC/Se electrode were investigated for different activation temperatures (500, 600, 700, and 800 °C). The study revealed that the structure of PWC activated below 800 °C consists of mainly micropores. Moreover, by increasing the activation temperature, the specific surface area and pore volume increased, and pore size distribution shifted towards mesoporous structure. The Li-Se coin cell made from PWC activated at 600 °C (PWC600) demonstrated superior discharge capacity (640 mAh g–1 at 0.1C after 400 cycles), rate capability, and long cycling stability at higher current densities. The microporous features of PWC600 were crucial for effective Se confinement, lithium-ion diffusion, and charge transfer. This work emphasizes the sustainable development of microporous carbon from upcycled plastic waste as a promising cathode material for high-energy Li-Se batteries. Our findings contribute to environmentally friendly energy storage solutions and the circular economy by repurposing non-recyclable plastic waste into valuable materials.",

        "abstract": "Calcium ion batteries (CIBs) are considered as an important candidate for post‐lithium energy storage devices due to their abundance of resources and low cost. However, CIBs still suffer from slow kinetics due to the large solvation structure and high desolvation energy of Ca2+ ions. Here, a solvation regulation strategy based on donor number (DN) is reported to achieve easy‐desolvation and rapid storage of Ca2+ in sodium vanadate (Na2V6O16·2H2O, NVO). Specially, the solvent with a low DN, represented by propylene carbonate (PC), forms the first solvation shell of calcium ions with weak binding energy and small shell structure, which facilitates the migration of Ca2+ in the electrolyte. More importantly, the low DN solvent is preferentially desolvated at the cathode/electrolyte interface, promoting the insertion of Ca2+ into the NVO electrode. Mechanism studies further confirm the highly reversible uptake/release of Ca2+ in the NVO cathode, along with the VO distance change in the coordination structure. Therefore, the NVO cathode achieves high capacity (376 mAh g−1 at 0.3 A g−1) and high‐rate performance (151 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1). The weak solvation effect strategy further improves the electrochemical performance and provides great importance for the design of the long‐term development of CIBs.",

        "abstract": "Layer metal oxides demonstrate great commercial application potential in sodium-ion batteries, while their commercialization is extremely hampered by the unsatisfactory cycling performance caused by the irreversible phase transition and interfacial side reaction. Herein, trimethoxymethylsilane (TMSI) is introduced into electrolytes to construct an advanced cathode/electrolyte interphase by tuning the solvation structure of anions. It is found that due to the stronger interaction between ClO4- and TMSI than that of ClO4- and PC/FEC, the ClO4--TMSI complexes tend to accumulate on the surface of the cathode during the charging process, leading to the formation of a stable cathode/electrolyte interface (CEI). In addition, the Si species with excellent electronic insulation ability are distributed in the TMSI-derived CEI film, which is conducive to inhibiting the continuous side reaction of solvents and the growth of the CEI film. As a result, under a current density of 250 mA g-1, the capacity retention of the NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) cathode after 200 cycles in the TMSI-modified electrolyte is 74.4% in comparison to 51.5% of the bare electrolyte (1 M NaClO4/PC/5% FEC). Moreover, the NFM cathode shows better kinetics, with the specific discharge capacity increasing from 22 to 67 mAh g-1 at 300 mA g-1. It also demonstrates greatly improved rate capability, cycling stability, and Coulombic efficiency under various operating conditions, including high temperature (55 °C) and high cutoff voltage (2.0-4.3 V vs Na+/Na).",

        "abstract": "Iron-based mixed polyanion phosphate Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) is recognized as a promising cathode for Sodium-ion Batteries (SIBs) due to its low cost and environmental friendliness. However, its inherent low conductivity and sluggish Na+ diffusion limit fast charge and low-temperature sodium storage. This study pioneers a scalable synthesis of hollow core-shelled Na4Fe2.4Ni0.6(PO4)2P2O7 with tiny-void space (THoCS-0.6Ni) via a one-step spray-drying combined with calcination process due to the different viscosity, coordination ability, molar ratios, and shrinkage rates between citric acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone. This unique structure with interconnected carbon networks ensures rapid electron transport and fast Na+ diffusion, as well as efficient space utilization for relieve volume expansion. Incorporating regulation of lattice structure by doping Ni heteroatom to effectively improve intrinsic electron and Na+ diffusion path and energy barrier, which achieves fast charge and low-temperature sodium storage. As a result, THoCS-0.6Ni exhibits superior rate capability (86.4 mAh g-1 at 25 C). Notably, THoCS-0.6Ni demonstrates exceptional cycling stability at -20 °C with a capacity of 43.6 mAh g-1 after 2500 cycles at 5 C. This work provides a universal strategy to design the hollow core-shelled structure with tiny-void space cathode materials for reversible batteries with fast-charge and low-temperature storage features.",

The extraction of vanadium (V) ions from alkaline solution using Aliquat® 336 was followed by the production of metal vanadates through precipitation stripping. Precipitation stripping was carried out using solutions of the corresponding metal ions (Ni (II), Co (II), Mn (II) and Zn (II), 0.05 mol/L in 4 mol/L NaCl), and the addition time of the strip solution was varied (0, 1 and 2 h). The time-dependent experiments showed a notable influence on the composition, structure, morphology and crystallinity of the two-dimensional vanadate products. Inspired by these findings, we selected two metallic vanadate products and studied their properties as alternative cathode materials for nonaqueous sodium and lithium metal batteries.",

        "abstract": "The electrochemical charge storage of sodium vanadate (NaV3O8 or NVO) cathodes in aqueous Zn-ion batteries has been hypothesized to be influenced by the inclusion of structural water for facilitating ion transfer in the material. Materials properties considered important (morphology, crystallite and particle size, surface area) are systematically studied herein through investigation of two NVO materials, NaV3O8·0.34H2O [NVO(300)] and NaV3O8·0.05H2O [NVO(500)], with different water content, acicular morphologies with different size and surface area achieved via post-synthesis heat treatment. The electrochemistry of the two materials was evaluated in aqueous Zn-ion cells with 2 M ZnSO4 electrolyte using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic cycling, and rate capability testing. The thinner NVO(300) nanobelts (0.13 μm) demonstrate greater specific capacities and higher effective diffusion coefficients relative to the thicker NVO(500) nanorods. Notably however, while cells containing NVO(500) deliver lower specific capacity, they demonstrate enhanced capacity retention with cycling. The structural changes accompanying oxidation and reduction are elucidated via ex situ X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and operando V K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), where NVO material properties are shown to influence the ion insertion. Operando XAS verified that electron transfer corresponds directly to change in vanadium oxidation state, affirming vanadium redox as the governing electrochemical process.",

For this reason, it is crucial to find new electrode materials that minimize its use or even fully remove this element from synthesis. We have prepared a Na0.67Mg0.05FexNiyMnzO2 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2; y = 0.05, 0.15; 0.6 ≤ z ≤ 0.9) series with low Ni and Fe contents by a single and easily scalable sol-gel method. This procedure yields high-purity and crystalline samples as evidenced by structural, morphological, and spectroscopic studies, including X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The electrochemical tests showed an exceptional performance for the F0N05 sample with the lowest (Ni + Fe) contents, at 5 C (ca. 100 mA h g-1), and good capacity retention after 100 cycles. This excellent behaviour was also evidenced when cycling at -15 °C. These results were confirmed by electrochemical techniques, such as cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy, that evidenced a fast exchange of sodium ions due to a significant capacitive contribution and high apparent diffusion coefficients. Post-mortem analysis of the F0N05 electrodes by XRD showed the reversible insertion and the absence of detrimental P2-O2 and P2-P2' transitions, while XPS spectra demonstrated the reversible redox activity of both transition metals and oxygen.",

Herein, water-pillared sodium vanadium bronze nanowires (Na2 V6 O16 ·1.63H2 O) are reported as cathode material for MIBs, which display high performance in magnesium storage. The hydrated sodium ions provide excellent structural stability. The charge shielding effect of lattice water enables fast Mg2+ diffusion. It exhibits high specific capacity of 175 mAh g-1 , long cycle life (450 cycles), and high coulombic efficiency (≈100%). At high current density of 200 mA g-1 , the capacity retention is up to 71% even after 450 cycles (compared to the highest capacity), demonstrating excellent long-term cycling performance. The nature of charge storage kinetics is explored. Furthermore, a highly reversible structure change during the electrochemical process is proved by comprehensive electrochemical analysis.

Gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) can relieve volatilization of liquid electrolyte, adapt to volume changes in electrodes, and better satisfy the requirements of long-term SMBs. Herein, a dense polyurethane-based GPE modified with polyacrylonitrile is synthesized by rapidly swelling two-component polyurethane/polyacrylonitrile electrospun fiber film. Compared to traditional porous GPEs obtained by swelling porous matrixes, the fiber film provides uniform high Na+ flux inside GPE due to its partial solubility property and ability to dissociate salts. Therefore, it can reduce the polarization effect and induce uniform metal deposition under high current in conjunction with its constructed hybrid N/F-containing solid electrolyte interface (SEI) that possesses low ionic diffusion barrier. The study demonstrates that GPE has an ionic conductivity of 1.816 mS cm-1 at 20 °C and an ion transference number of 0.53. The full battery (NVP/GPE/Na) assembled with this GPE and Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode shows 90.8% capacity retention rate after 1000 cycles at 10 C.

However, they suffer from rapid capacity fading and complicated phase transformations. In this study, we modulate the crystal structure and optimize the electrochemical performances of Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.5O2 by Al doping for Mn or Fe, respectively, and the roles of Al in the enhancement of the rate capability and cycling performance are unraveled. (1) The substitution of Al for Mn or Fe decreases the lattice parameters a and c but enlarges d spacing and lengthens Na-O bonds, which enhances Na+ diffusion and rate capability especially for Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.47Al0.03O2. (2) Al doping reduces the thickness of TMO2 and strengthens TM-O/O-O bonding. This enhances the layered structure stability and the capacity retention. (3) Al doping mitigates Mn3+ and Jahn-Teller distortion, mitigating the irreversible phase transition. (4) Al doping also alleviates the lattice volume variation and the structure strain. This further improves the stability of the layered structure and the cycling performances particularly in the case of Al doping for Fe. The in-depth insights into the roles of Al substitution might be also useful for designing high-performance cathode materials for SIBs through appropriate lattice doping.",

        "abstract": "Rechargeable batteries based on the most abundant elements, such as sodium and iron, have a great potential in the development of cost effective sodium ion batteries for large scale energy storage devices. We report, for the first time, crystallite size dependent structural investigations on maricite-NaFePO4 through X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical simulations. Rietveld refinement analysis on the X-ray diffraction data reveals that a decrease in the unit cell parameters leads to volume contraction upon reduction in the crystallite size. Further, the atomic multiplet simulations on X-ray absorption spectra provide unequivocally a change in the site symmetry of transition metal ions. The high resolution oxygen K-edge spectra reveal a substantial change in the bonding character with the reduction of crystallite size, which is the fundamental cause for the change in the unit cell parameters of maricite-NaFePO4. In parallel, we performed first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations on maricite-NaFePO4 with different sodium ion vacancy concentrations. The obtained structural parameters are in excellent agreement with the experimental observations on the mesostructured maricite-NaFePO4. The volumetric changes with respect to crystallite size are related to the compressive strain, resulting in the improvement in the electronic diffusivity. The nano-crystalline maricite-NaFePO4 with improved kinetics will open a new avenue for its usage as a cathode material in sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Owing to their high redox potential and availability of numerous diffusion channels in metal–organic frameworks, Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are attractive for metal ion storage applications. Recently, vanadium ferrocyanides (VFCN) have received a great deal of attention for application in sodium-ion batteries, as they demonstrate a stable capacity with high redox potential of ~3.3 V vs. Na/Na+. Nevertheless, there have been no reports on the application of VFCN in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). In this work, a facile synthesis of VFCN was performed using a simple solvothermal method under ambient air conditions through the redox reaction of VCl3 with K3[Fe(CN)6]. VFCN exhibited a high redox potential of ~3.7 V vs. Li/Li+ and a reversible capacity of ~50 mAh g–1. The differential capacity plots revealed changes in the electrochemical properties of VFCN after 50 cycles, in which the low spin of Fe ions was partially converted to high spin. Ex situ X-ray diffraction measurements confirmed the unchanged VFCN structure during cycling. This demonstrated the high structural stability of VFCN. The low cost of precursors, simplicity of the process, high stability, and reversibility of VFCN suggest that it can be a candidate for large-scale production of cathode materials for LIBs.",

        "abstract": "To overcome the inherent limitations of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) such as relatively low energy density and operating voltage compared to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), Oxygen redox chemistry is considered to realizing a high-performance battery system. However, oxygen redox commonly accompanied problems such as sluggish kinetics, O2 gas loss, and irreversible structural rearrangement with voltage hysteresis. Herein, we suggest a new model that deviates from the tendency of relying on oxygen redox reaction to realize high capacity. A deep investigation of Na0.6Mg0.2Mn0.8O2 (NMM) and Na0.6Mg0.2Ru0.2Mn0.6O2 (NMRM) is conducted by various analysis tools for the comparison. The highly oxidized Ru5+ lowers the Mn oxidation state in the structure without the Jahn-Teller effect. It drives the increased participation of Mn in the overall electrochemical reaction and the charge compensation by oxygen redox reaction is mostly replaced by the Mn3+/Mn4+ redox pair. A strong covalence of Ru stabilizes the structure and prevents cation migration from TM to Na slap. As a result, even though the specific weight increased, practical capacity was improved by maximizing the participation of Na+ ions, and we confirm that cyclability and rate capability also improved.",

        "abstract": "Mn-based Prussian blue analogues (PBA) are of great interest as a prospective cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high redox potential, easy synthesis and low cost. However, the Jahn-Teller effect and low electrical conductivity of Mn-based PBA causes poor structure stability and unsatisfactory performance during the cycling. Herein, we develop a novel Ni and Cu co-doped K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] cathode via a simple co-precipitation strategy. The doping elements improve the electrical conductivity of Mn-based PBA by reducing the bandgap, as well as suppress the Jahn-Teller effect by stabilizing the framework, as verified by the density functional theory calculations. Simultaneously, the substitution of sodium with potassium in the lattice is beneficial for filling vacancies in the PBA framework, leading to higher average operating voltages and superior structural stability. As a result, the as-prepared Mn-based cathode exhibits excellent reversible capacity (116.0 mAh g-1 at 0.01 A g-1) and superior cycling stability (81.8% capacity retention over 500 cycles at 0.1 A g-1).

The NaPO3 nanolayer on the surface effectively stabilizes the crystal structure by inhibiting surface parasitic reactions and increasing the observed average voltage. Superior cyclic stability is exhibited by the surface-modified cathode (80.1% vs 63.6%) after 150 cycles at 1 C in the wide voltage range of 2.0 V-4.2 V (vs Na+ /Na). Moreover, benefiting from the inherent ionic conduction of NaPO3 , the surface-modified cathode presents excellent rate capability (103 mAh g-1  vs 60 mAh g-1 ) at 10 C.

        "abstract": "The two‐phase reaction of Na3V2(PO4)3 – Na1V2(PO4)3 in Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is hindered by low electronic and ionic conductivity. To address this problem, a surface‐N‐doped NVP encapsulating by N‐doped carbon nanocage (N‐NVP/N‐CN) is rationally constructed, wherein the nitrogen is doped in both the surface crystal structure of NVP and carbon layer. The surface crystal modification decreases the energy barrier of Na+ diffusion from bulk to electrolyte, enhances intrinsic electronic conductivity, and releases lattice stress. Meanwhile, the porous architecture provides more active sites for redox reactions and shortens the diffusion path of ion. Furthermore, the new interphase of Na2V2(PO4)3 is detected by in situ XRD and clarified by density functional theory (DFT) calculation with a lower energy barrier during the fast reversible electrochemical three‐phase reaction of Na3V2(PO4)3 – Na2V2(PO4)3 – Na1V2(PO4)3. Therefore, as cathode of sodium‐ion battery, the N‐NVP/N‐CN exhibited specific capacities of 119.7 and 75.3 mAh g−1 at 1 C and even 200 C. Amazingly, high capacities of 89.0, 86.2, and 84.6 mAh g−1 are achieved after overlong 10000 cycles at 20, 40, and 50 C, respectively. This approach provides a new idea for surface crystal modification to cast intermediate Na2V2(PO4)3 phase for achieving excellent cycling stability and rate capability.",

Here, different electrolyte systems, including commonly used 1.0 M NaPF6/diglyme (NP-005), 1.0 M NaPF6 /propylene carbonate (PC)/5.0% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) (NP-009), 1.0 M NaClO4 /ethylene carbonate-dimethyl carbonate (EC-DMC) =1: 1 Vol%/5.0% FEC (NC-019) and 1.0 M NaClO4 /PC (NC-013), are systematically investigated and compared for NVPF1+2x cathode. NVPF1+2x  with NP-009 shows a more superior cycle stability and rate capability at 1 C~10 C (1 C=130 mA g -1 ) than that of NC-019 and NC-013 while NVPF1+2x  with NP-005 shows the best high-rate capability at 20 C~50 C.  It demonstrates that NVPF1+2x  with NP-005 exhibits a thin, efficient and NaF-rich CEI layer with less polarization, smaller interfacial resistance and faster Na+ diffusion than that of NC-019 and NC-013 since they suffered from a thick, over-grown CEI layer due to the consecutive decomposition of FEC, NaClO4 and/or linear DMC.

In this study, we fabricated various Fe-V-incorporated hexacyanoferrates, which are Prussian blue analogs, via a one-step synthesis. These compounds changed their colors from blue to green to yellow with increasing amounts of incorporated V ions. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectrum revealed that V3+ was oxidized to V4+ in the cubic Prussian blue structure, which enhanced the electrochemical stability and increased the voltage platform. The vanadium ferrocyanide Prussian blue (VFPB1) electrode, which contains V4+ and Fe2+ in the Prussian blue structure, showed Na insertion/extraction potential of 3.26/3.65 V vs. Na/Na+. The cycling test revealed a stable capacity of ~70 mAh g−1 at a rate of 50 mA g−1 and a capacity retention of 82.5% after 100 cycles.

Herein, an ordered Na2/3[Ni2/9Mg1/9Mn5/9Ti1/9]O2 (NMMT) is designed and investigated as a high-performance cathode for SIBs through the synergistic effect of Mg and Ti codoping. Compared to the single Mg- or Ti-doped materials, NMMT clearly exhibits superstructure ordering diffraction peaks, and neutron diffraction further confirms that the diffraction peaks can be well indexed by a larger supercell P63, rather than the common unit cell P63/mmc by X-ray diffraction (XRD). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy also approves the ordering arrangement. This material shows an obvious capacity activation process during the first cycles, thus delivering 113 mA h g-1 specific capacity at 0.1 C (close to the theoretical value). Excellent rate capability even at 15 C and cycling stability after 500 cycles between 2.0 and 4.3 V can also be achieved, indicating that an ordered cathode is still promising.

In this paper, firstly, the diversity of cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries is systematically introduced, as well as the layered oxide structures among them are categorized, and then it focuses on the O3-type sodium-rich Na2MO3, which is promising for large-scale commercial applications, illustrating the development and mechanism of anion redox. Excess Na transforms the transition metal layer into the mixed Na1/3M2/3O2layer, leading to the formation of localized configuration Na-O-Na. Thereby, isolated nonhybridized O 2p states are introduced, which participate in the charge compensation process (O2-/On-) under high-voltage conditions and provide the battery with additional capacity beyond the cation redox reaction. Therefore, the Na2MO3 formed by its transition metal element located in different periods are classified, discussed and summarized in terms of structural change characteristics, electrochemical properties and anion-redox mechanism. However, this particular redox mechanism is also accompanied by the challenges such as voltage hysteresis, irreversible oxygen loss, TM migration, capacity decay and poor air stability. Therefore, to address these challenges, various improvement strategies have been proposed, including doping of large radius metal ions, light metal ions, transition metal ions with high covalency with O, nonmetal ions, formation of mixed phases, and surface modification. This work is expected to provide new ways to find and design novel high-capacity Na-rich layered oxide cathode materials. .",

        "abstract": "Rechargeable aqueous zinc‐ion batteries are of great potential as one of the next‐generation energy‐storage devices due to their low cost and high safety. However, the development of long‐term stable electrodes and electrolytes still suffers from great challenges. Herein, a self‐separation strategy is developed for an interface layer design to optimize both electrodes and electrolytes simultaneously. Specifically, the coating with an organometallics (sodium tricyanomethanide) evolves into an electrically responsive shield layer composed of nitrogen, carbon‐enriched polymer network, and sodium ions, which not only modulates the zinc‐ion migration pathways to inhibit interface side reactions but also adsorbs onto Zn perturbations to induce planar zinc deposition. Additionally, the separated ions from the coating can diffuse to the electrolyte to affect the Zn2+ solvation structure and maintain the cathode structural stability by forming a stable cathode–electrolyte interface and sodium ions’ equilibrium, confirmed by in situ spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis. Due to these unique advantages, the symmetric zinc batteries exhibit an extralong cycling lifespan of 3000 h and rate performance at 20 mA cm−2 at wide temperatures. The efficiency of the self‐separation strategy is further demonstrated in practical full batteries with an ultralong lifespan over 10 000 cycles from −35 to 60 °C.",

        "abstract": "Glassy solid electrolytes (GSE) for all-solid-state sodium-ion batteries have the potential to combine the low cost of sodium, the improved energy density and safety of solid-state batteries, and the excellent processability of glass in one system. The 0.54 Na2S + 0.33 SiS2 + 0.06 PS5/2 + 0.06 NaPO3 (NaPSiSO-15) GSE was shown to be a promising candidate for a thin-film glassy solid electrolyte, with a room temperature conductivity of 3.2 x 10-5 S/cm, a critical current density of 0.80 mA-hr/cm2, and the capability to be drawn into films thinner than 100 μm. However, this composition was found to have sulfur defect structures that proved problematic for use in cathode applications, reacting to form Na2S. To resolve this problem, new glass compositions with reduced sodium-to-glass former ratios (R-value) were developed, exploring compositions between R=2.0 and R=3.0. The structure of these compositions was explored using Raman, Fourier transformed infrared, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Their electrochemical behavior was also characterized using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. These results were used to find a composition without the defects found at high R-values and avoid crystallization seen at lower R-values.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion battery technologies are emerging as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries by utilizing the earth abundant, widely distributed, and low-cost sodium resources. Among different types of sodium ion cathodes, transition metal based layered oxide cathodes have a superior edge due to their comparatively higher energy density, lower cost, environment friendly raw materials, and similar synthesis chemistry as the already commercialized lithium-ion battery cathode materials. They also enable the incorporation of iron, an abundant, low-cost, and environmentally benign element, replacing the toxic and expensive cobalt.\n In such layered oxide-based cathodes, transition metals exhibit heterogenous elemental and oxidation state distribution at different depths of the particles (e.g., from the surface to bulk) which can influence the stability, mechanical integrity, and electrochemical performance of these particles to a significant extent. The inherent local structural and electronic state heterogeneity developed in these materials during synthesis can modulate the charge distribution heterogeneity and consequent phase transitions during cycling, ultimately controlling the battery performance.\n In this work, a sodium transition metal layered oxide cathode is synthesized using a co-precipitation method followed by high temperature calcination under different calcination durations. Calcining the material at different conditions lead to the formation of particles with different morphologies and grain growth behavior. Using electron microscopy and Xray diffraction techniques, the grain growth behavior at different stages of calcination is studied. This will guide the design of particles with better morphologies and grain orientation which demonstrate improved electrochemical performance. Transition metal distribution and oxidation state change at different depths of the particles are probed using synchrotron based Xray absorption spectroscopy and three-dimensional Transmission Xray microscopy. The particles are probed at the surface, subsurface and deep into the bulk, which show heterogeneity in the distribution of transition metal oxidation state and provide insight into the phase transitions during calcination. This study can pave the way for better understanding of phase evolution during synthesis and improved design of cathode particle morphology and composition by identifying and eliminating the detrimental phases occurring during different stages of calcination.",

However, achieving high capacity requires overcoming challenges such as oxygen-redox failure, sluggish kinetics, and structural degradation. Herein, we employ an innovative crystal modulation strategy, using Mn-based Na0.72Li0.24Mn0.76O2 as a representative cathode material, which shows that the highly exposed {010} active facets enable an enhanced rate capability (119.6 mAh g-1 at 10C) with fast kinetics. Meanwhile, the reinforced Mn-O bond inhibits excessive oxidation of lattice oxygen and O-O cohesion loss, stabilizing and maintaining a long-enduring reversible oxygen-redox activity (100% high capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.5C and 84.28% retention after 300 cycles at 5C). Time-resolved operando two-dimensional X-ray diffraction reveals the robust structural stability, zero-strain behavior, and suppressed phase transition with ultra-low volume variation during cycling at different rates (0.1C: 1.75%, 1C: 0.31%, 5C: 0.04%). Additionally, the full cell coupled with hard carbon achieves a high energy density of approximately 211 Wh kg-1 with superior performance.

Among the potential cathode materials, poly‐anionic cathode materials could be a better choice for their stability and safety in comparison to layered transition metal oxides and Prussian blue analogues (PBA). However, on the other hand, the conductivity as well as the available capacity of the polyanion compounds are still poor, which limits their applications; moreover, some polyanion cathode operate at low voltage, which reduces the energy density and raises the cost of the battery system. We here try to summarize the recent progress of polyanion compounds as cathode materials for SIB. These compounds are categorized based on the metal redox couple, including V‐, Cr‐, Mn‐, Fe‐, Co‐, and Ni‐polyanion compounds.

        "abstract": "\n O3-type layered oxide cathodes, such as NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2, have garnered significant attention due to their high theoretical specific capacity while using abundant and low-cost sodium as intercalation species. Unlike the lithium analog (LiNiO2), NaNiO2 (NNO) exhibits poor electrochemical performance resulting from structural instability and inferior Coulomb efficiency. To enhance its cyclability for practical application, NNO was modified by titanium substitution to yield the O3-type NaNi0.9Ti0.1O2 (NNTO), which was successfully synthesized for the first time via a solid-state reaction. The mechanism behind its superior performance in comparison to that of similar materials is examined in detail using a variety of characterization techniques. NNTO delivers a specific discharge capacity of ~190 mAh/g and exhibits good reversibility, even in the presence of multiple phase transitions during cycling in a potential window of 2.0‒4.2 V vs. Na+/Na. This behavior can be attributed to the substituent, which helps maintain a larger interslab distance in the Na-deficient phases and to mitigate Jahn-Teller activity by reducing the average oxidation state of nickel. However, volume collapse at high potentials and irreversible lattice oxygen loss are still detrimental to the NNTO. Nevertheless, the performance can be further enhanced through coating and doping strategies. This not only positions NNTO as a promising next-generation cathode material, but also serves as inspiration for future research directions in the field of high-energy-density Na-ion batteries.",

However, its poor cyclic stability and rate performance hinder its practical applications, which is largely related to lattice oxygen instability. Here, we propose to coat the cathode of SIBs with Li2ZrO3, which realizes the \"three-in-one\" modification of Li2ZrO3 coating and Li+, Zr4+ co-doping. The synergy of Li2ZrO3 coating and Li+/Zr4+ doping improves both the cycle stability and rate performance, and the underlying modification mechanism is revealed by a series of characterization methods. The doping of Zr4+ increases the interlayer spacing of MF, reduces the diffusion barrier of Na+, and reduces the ratio of Mn3+/Mn4+, thus inhibiting the Jahn-Teller effect. The Li2ZrO3 coating layer inhibits the side reaction between the cathode and the electrolyte. The synergy of Li2ZrO3 coating and Li+, Zr4+ co-doping enhances the stability of lattice oxygen and the reversibility of anionic redox, which improves the cycle stability and rate performance.

We systematically investigate the electronic structure of a series of metal-doped Na2RuO3 compounds to illustrate this electronic structure tuning approach. Furthermore, we provide a systematic strategy for achieving reversible anionic redox and emphasize that it depends on multiple factors governing the electronic structure of the material, rather than solely relying on the covalent interaction between the transition metal and oxygen. Utilizing the aforementioned strategy, we identify a doped Na-rich material capable of exhibiting reversible cationic and anionic redox.

        "abstract": "The development of secondary batteries based on abundant and cheap elements is vital. Among various alternatives to conventional lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are promising due to the abundant resources and low cost of sodium. While there are many challenges associated with the SIB system, cathode is an important factor in determining the electrochemical performance of this battery system. Accordingly, ongoing research in the field of SIBs is inclined towards the development of safe, cost effective cathode materials having improved performance. In particular, pyrophosphate cathodes have recently demonstrated decent electrochemical performance and thermal stability. Herein, we report the synthesis, electrochemical properties, and thermal behavior of a novel Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 cathode for SIBs. The material was synthesized through a solid state process. The structural analysis reveals that the mixed substitution of manganese and iron has resulted in a triclinic crystal structure (P1[combining macron] space group). Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements indicate that Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 is electrochemically active with a reversible capacity of ∼80 mA h g(-1) at a C/20 rate with an average redox potential of 3.2 V. (vs. Na/Na(+)). It is noticed that 84% of initial capacity is preserved over 90 cycles showing promising cyclability. It is also noticed that the rate capability of Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 is better than Na2MnP2O7. Ex situ and CV analyses indicate that Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 undergoes a single phase reaction rather than a biphasic reaction due to different Na coordination environment and different Na site occupancy when compared to other pyrophosphate materials (Na2FeP2O7 and Na2MnP2O7). Thermogravimetric analysis (25-550 °C) confirms good thermal stability of Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 with only 2% weight loss. Owing to promising electrochemical properties and decent thermal stability, Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7, can be an attractive cathode for SIBs.",

        "title": "Na3V2(PO4)3-decorated Na3V2(PO4)2F3 as a high-rate and cycle-stable cathode material for sodium ion batteries",
        "abstract": "Since Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) possesses modest volume deformation and three-dimensional ion diffusion channels, it is a potential sodium-ion battery cathode material that has been extensively researched. Nonetheless, NVP still endures the consequences of poor electronic conductivity and low voltage platforms, which need to be further improved. On this basis, a high voltage platform Na3V2(PO4)2F3 was introduced to form a composite with NVP to increase the energy density. In this study, the sol–gel technique was successfully used to synthesize a Na3V2(PO4)2.75F0.75/C (NVPF·3NVP/C) composite cathode material. The citric acid-derived carbon layer was utilized to construct three-dimensional conducting networks to effectively promote ion and electron diffusion. Furthermore, the composites' synergistic effect accelerates the quick ionic migration and improves the kinetic reaction. In particular, NVP as the dominant phase enhanced the structural stability and significantly increased the capacitive contribution. Therefore, at 0.1C, the discharge capacity of the modified NVPF·3NVP/C composite is 120.7 mA h g−1, which is greater than the theoretical discharge capacity of pure NVP (118 mA h g−1). It discharged 110.9 mA h g−1 of reversible capacity even at an elevated multiplicity of 10C, and after 200 cycles, it retained 64.1% of its capacity. Thus, the effort produced an optimized NVPF·3NVP/C composite cathode material that may be used in the sodium ion cathode.",

        "title": "Enabling Anionic Redox Stability of P2‐Na5/6Li1/4Mn3/4O2 by Mg Substitution",
        "abstract": "Oxygen‐based anionic redox reactions have recently emerged as a lever to increase the capacity of Mn‐rich layered oxide cathodes in addition to the charge compensation based on cationic redox reactions for sodium‐ion batteries. Unfortunately, the irreversibility of anionic redox often aggravates irreversible structure change and poor cycling performance. Here, a stable anionic redox is achieved through substituting Na ions by Mg ions in P2‐type Na0.83Li0.25Mn0.75O2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Mg substitution effectively decreases the oxygen chemical potential, causing an improvement in lattice oxygen stability. Moreover, at a highly desodiated state, Mg ions that remain in the lattice and interact with O 2p orbitals can decrease the undercoordinated oxygen and the nonbonded, electron‐deficient O 2p states, facilitating the reversibility of oxygen redox. When cycled in the voltage range of 2.6–4.5 V where only anionic redox occurs for charge compensation, Na0.773Mg0.03Li0.25Mn0.75O2 presents a much better reversibility, giving a 4 times better cycle stability than that of Na0.83Li0.25Mn0.75O2. Experimentally, Na0.773Mg0.03Li0.25Mn0.75O2 exhibits a ≈1.1% volume expansion during sodium insertion/extraction, suggestive of a “zero‐strain” cathode. Overall, the work opens a new avenue for enhancing anionic reversibility of oxygen‐related Mn‐rich cathodes.",

        "abstract": "Sodium layered oxides always suffer from sluggish kinetics and deleterious phase transformations at deep-desodiation state (i.e., >4.0 V) in O3 structure, incurring inferior rate capability and grievous capacity degradation. To tackle these handicaps, here, a configurational entropy tuning protocol through manipulating the stoichiometric ratios of inactive cations is proposed to elaborately design Na-deficient, O3-type NaxTmO2 cathodes. It is found that the electrons surrounding the oxygen of the TmO6 octahedron are rearranged by the introduction of MnO6 and TiO6 octahedra in Na-deficient O3-type Na0.83Li0.1Ni0.25Co0.2Mn0.15Ti0.15Sn0.15O2-δ (MTS15) with expanded O-Na-O slab spacing, giving enhanced Na+ diffusion kinetics and structural stability, as disclosed by theoretical calculations and electrochemical measurements. Concomitantly, the entropy effect contributes to the improved reversibility of Co redox and phase-transition behaviors between O3 and P3, as clearly revealed by ex situ synchrotron X-ray absorption spectra and in situ X-ray diffraction. Notably, the prepared entropy-tuned MTS15 cathode exhibits impressive rate capability (76.7% capacity retention at 10 C), cycling stability (87.2% capacity retention after 200 cycles) with a reversible capacity of 109.4 mAh g-1, good full-cell performance (84.3% capacity retention after 100 cycles), and exceptional air stability.

        "abstract": "O3-type layered oxides hold significant promise as the material for cathodes in sodium-ion batteries for their favorable electrochemical properties, while irreversible structural degradation and harmful phase transitions during cyclic operation limit the practical application of these materials. In this work, we proposed a La3+/Al3+ codoping strategy in O3-Na(Ni1/3Mn1/3Fe1/3)O2 cathode materials and found that batteries with the Na (Ni1/3Mn1/3Fe1/3)0.998La0.001Al0.001O2 (NFM-La/Al) cathodes exhibited not only promoted capacity from 135.80 to 170.42 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C but also significantly enhanced cycling stability, with a 10% improvement in capacity retention compared with NFM cathodes after 300 cycles. Particularly, their rate performance was significantly improved as well. XRD and XPS tests indicated that La could expand the c-axis of NFM due to its larger ionic radius and thus significantly increased Na+ ion diffusion efficiency, and in addition, Al doping could effectively increase the content of Ni2+ and Mn4+ and thus greatly alleviated the negative Jahn-Teller effect caused by Mn3+. Moreover, consistent with XRD analyses, DFT calculations further substantiated the effectiveness of the La/Al codoping strategy by demonstrating the detailed atom substitution mechanism in the NFM crystal lattice. The boosted structure stability and Na+ diffusion kinetics may enhance the potential for practical applications of O3-type oxide cathodes.",

However, issues such as low electronic conductivity and partial cation dissolution contribute to high polarization and structure distortion.

The optimized sample exhibited a high-rate capacity of 71.8 mAh g-1 at 30 C (83.1% capacity retention after 1000 cycles) and excellent performance over a wide temperature range (84.1 mAh g-1 at 60 °C and 61.4 mAh g-1 at -30 °C). In situ X-ray diffraction technology confirmed a redox solid solution and a two-phase reaction mechanism, revealing minor changes in cell volume and slight strain variations after Zr doping, effectively suppressing the structural distortion. Theoretical calculations illustrated that Zr doping largely shrinks the band gap of NMVP, enriches local electron density, and slightly alters the local element distribution and bond lengths. Moreover, full-cells have shown high energy density (259.9 Wh kg-1) and outstanding cycling stability (200 cycles).

O3‐type layered oxides have been considered as one of the most promising cathodes for SIBs.

Here, a series of sodium‐sufficient O3‐type NaNi0.5Mn0.5‐ x Ti x O2 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) cathodes for SIBs is reported and the mechanisms behind their excellent electrochemical performance are studied in comparison to those of their respective end‐members. The combined analysis of in situ X‐ray diffraction, ex situ X‐ray absorption spectroscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy for NaNi0.5Mn0.2Ti0.3O2 reveals that the O3‐type phase transforms reversibly into a P3‐type phase upon Na+ deintercalation/intercalation. The substitution of Ti for Mn enlarges interslab distance and could restrain the unfavorable and irreversible multiphase transformation in the high voltage regions that is usually observed in O3‐type NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2, resulting in improved Na cell performance. This integration of macroscale and atomicscale engineering strategy might open up the modulation of the chemical and physical properties in layered oxides and grasp new insight into the optimal design of high‐performance cathode materials for SIBs.",

Li introduction constructs a special Li-O-Na configuration activating reversible nonbonded O 2p (|O2p)-type ARR and regulates the structure evolution way, enabling the reversible Li ions out-of-layer migration instead of the irreversible transition metal ions out-of-layer migration. The reversible structure evolution enhances the reversibility of the bonded O 2p (O2p)-type ARR and inhibits the generation of oxygen dimers, thus suppressing the irreversible molecular oxygen (O2)-type ARR. After the structure regulation, the structure evolution becomes reversible, |O2p-type ARR is activated, O2p-type ARR becomes stable, and O2-type ARR is inhibited, which largely suppresses the capacity degradation and voltage decay.

        "abstract": "Rechargeable sodium-iodine and lithium-iodine batteries have been demonstrated to be promising and scalable energy-storage devices, but their development has been seriously limited by challenges such as their inferior stability and the poor kinetics of iodine. Anchoring iodine to 3D porous carbon is an effective strategy to overcome these defects; however, both the external architecture and internal microstructure of the 3D porous carbon host can greatly affect the ion intercalation of iodine/C electrodes. To realize the full potential of iodine electrodes, a biochemistry-enabled route was developed to enable the controllable design of different 3D porous architectures, from hollow microspheres to 3D foam, for use in iodine/C cathodes. Two types of spores with spherical cells, i.e. Cibotium Barometz (C. Barometz) and Oetes Sinesis (O. Sinesis), are employed as bio-precursors. By carefully controlling the degree of damage on the bio-precursors, different targeted carbon hosts were fabricated. Systematic studies were carried out to clarify the structural effects on modifying the ion-intercalation capabilities of the iodine/C cathodes in lithium-iodine and sodium-iodine batteries. Our results demonstrate the profound performance improvements of both 3D bio-foam and hollow sphere because their hierarchically porous structures can strongly immobilize iodine. Notably, the 3D bio-foam based iodine composites achieve faster ion kinetics and enhanced rate capability than their hollow sphere based counterparts. This was attributed to their higher micro/mesopore volume, larger surface area and improved packing density, which result in the highly efficient adsorption of iodine species. By virtue of the thinnest slices, the iodine/bio-foam derived from C. Barometz spores achieves the best high-rate long-term cycling capability, which retains 94% and 91% of their capacities in lithium-iodine and sodium-iodine batteries after 500 cycles, respectively. With the help of the biochemistry-assisted technique, our study provides a much-needed fundamental insight for the rational design of 3D porous iodine/C composites, which will promote a significant research direction for the practical application of lithium/sodium-iodine batteries.",

        "title": "One–Step Synthesis of Three–Dimensional Na3V2(PO4)3/Carbon Frameworks as Promising Sodium–Ion Battery Cathode",
        "abstract": "Sodium–ion batteries (SIBs) are essential for large–scale energy storage attributed to the high abundance of sodium. Polyanion Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is a dominant cathode candidate for SIBs because of its high-voltage and sodium superionic conductor (NASICON) framework. However, the electrochemical performance of NVP is hindered by the inherently poor electronic conductivity, especially for extreme fast charging and long-duration cycling. Herein, we develop a facile one-step in-situ polycondensation method to synthesize the three-dimensional (3D) Na3V2(PO4)3/holey-carbon frameworks (NVP@C) by using melamine as carbon source. In this architecture, NVP crystals intergrown with the 3D holey-carbon frameworks provide rapid transport pathways for ion/electron transmission to increase the ultrahigh rate ability and cycle capability. Consequently, the NVP@C cathode possesses a high reversible capacity of 113.9 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and delivers an outstanding high–rate capability of 75.3 mAh g−1 at 6000 mA g−1. Moreover, it shows that the NVP@C cathode is able to display a volumetric energy density of 54 Wh L−1 at 6000 mA g−1 (31 Wh L−1 for NVP bulk), as well as excellent cycling performance of 65.4 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 2000 mA g−1. Furthermore, the NVP@C exhibits remarkable reversible capabilities of 81.9 mAh g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 and 60.2 mAh g−1 at 1000 mA g−1 even at a low temperature of −15 °C. The structure of porous carbon frameworks combined with single crystal materials by in-situ polycondensation offers general guidelines for the design of sodium, lithium and potassium energy storage materials.",

        "abstract": "Recently, nonmetal NH4 + ions have attracted extensive attention for use as charge carries in the field of energy storage due to their abundant resources, environmental friendliness, and low cost. However, the development of aqueous ammonium-ion batteries (AAIBs) is constrained by the absence of high-voltage and long-life materials. Herein, different tunnel-structure MnO2 materials (α-, β-, and γ-MnO2 ) are utilized as cathodes for AAIBs and hybrid-ion batteries and compared, and α-MnO2 is demonstrated to exhibit the most remarkable electrochemical performance. The α-MnO2 cathode material delivers the highest discharge capacity of 219 mAh g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1 and the best cyclability with a capacity retention of 95.4% after 10 000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1 . Moreover, aqueous ammonium-ion and hybrid-ion (ammonium/sodium ions) full batteries are successfully constructed using α-MnO2 cathodes.

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is regarded as a promising cathode material for sodium ion batteries (NIBs) because of its 3D open structure suitable for Na insertion/extraction and high energy density. However, the NVP suffers from poor electrical conductivity, which restricts the rate performance and the long cycle performance of the NVP for NIBs. Here, the NVP particles embedded in the N,S co-doped 3D porous carbon matrix (denoted as NVP@3D-NSC) were prepared by a facile process. The NVP@3D-NSC can deliver high specific discharge capacities at high rates (54 mA h g-1 at 80 C). It exhibits a super long cycle life exceeding 6000 cycles (75 mA h g-1 at 20 C after 6000 cycles) and a low capacity-decay rate of 0.36% per cycle. The excellent electrochemical performance of the NVP@3D-NSC is attributed to the specific architecture of the material that combines a variety of advantages: a very short diffusion length of Na+/e- in small NVP particles, a high contact area between the electrolyte and electrode, and a 3D porous structure buffering the volume change during cycling. In addition, the N,S co-doped porous carbon matrix can not only improve the electrical conductivity, but also create some extrinsic defects and active sites, which can enhance the diffusion rate of sodium ions.",

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as a potential candidate to succeed lithium ion batteries (LIBs), because of the abundant sodium resources on earth. Layered vanadium oxides are regarded as the promising candidates for SIBs because of their large interlayer spacing, high theoretical specific capacity, abundant sources and low cost. In this paper, a vanadium oxide hydrate (H2V3O8) nanowire membrane is presented as a flexible cathode for SIBs without addition of any other additives (binders or conductive compounds). Such a freestanding flexible membrane exhibits a high specific capacity of 168 mA h g(-1) at 10 mA g(-1), and its high capacity is maintained well after 100 cycles. It is found that the capacitive charge storage accounts for a relatively large proportion of the total capacity, whereas the crystal structure of H2V3O8 is highly reversible during the sodiation/desodiation processes. This research demonstrates that the H2V3O8 nanowire is an exceptional candidate for SIBs.",

However, the undesired P2-O2 phase transition at high voltages above 4.0 V leads to a large volume change and further causes the rapid decay of capacity. Herein, an electrochemical-active Co3+ substitution is introduced to suppress the P2-O2 phase transformation but not at the cost of capacity. The spherical, Co3+ substituted P2-Na2/3[Ni0.3Co0.1Mn0.6]O2 with a high tap-density of 1.86 g cm-3 is successfully synthesized by co-precipitation and solid-state reactions. As anticipated, it delivers a large specific capacity of 161.6 mA h g-1 with a high median-voltage of 3.64 V (vs. Na/Na+), translated into a high energy-density of ∼590 W h kg-1, which is comparable to that of the commercialized LiCoO2 cathode in lithium-ion batteries. Apart from improved cycling stability ascribed to the mitigated P2-O2 transition, this cathode also shows a better rate property compared with those modified by Li+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, and Ti4+ doping and Al2O3 coating. Besides, the P2-Na2/3[Ni0.3Co0.1Mn0.6]O2|hard carbon full-cells deliver a reversible capacity of 150.6 mA h g-1 and have enhanced cycle-life and high-rate capability. These gratifying achievements indicate that this P2-Na2/3[Ni0.3Co0.1Mn0.6]O2 is a very promising candidate as a high energy-density cathode for SIBs.",

We apply this method to the characterization of ball-milling induced order-disorder phase transition in Li6CoO4 as a case study.

        "abstract": "Layered Na-based oxides with the general composition of NaxTMO2 (TM: transition metal) have attracted significant attention for their high compositional diversity that provides tunable electrochemical performance for electrodes in sodium-ion batteries. The various compositions bring forward complex structural chemistry that is decisive for the layered stacking structure, Na-ion conductivity, and the redox activity, potentially promising new avenues in functional material properties. In this work, we have explored the maximum Na content in P2-type layered oxides and discovered that the high-content Na in the host enhances the structural stability; moreover, it promotes the oxidation of low-valent cations to their high oxidation states (in this case Ni2+). This can be rationalized by the increased hybridization of the O(2p)-TM(3d-eg*) states, affecting both the local TM environment as well as the interactions between the NaO2 and TMO2 layers. These properties are highly beneficial for the Na storage capabilities as required for cathode materials in sodium-ion batteries. It leads to excellent Na-ion mobility, a large storage capacity (>100 mAh g–1 between 2.0-4.0 V), yet preventing the detrimental sliding of the TMO2 layers (P2–O2 structural transition), as reflected by the ultralong cycle life (3000 (dis)charge cycles demonstrated). These findings expand the horizons of high Na-content P2-type materials, providing new insights of the electronic and structural chemistry for advanced cathode materials.",

Herein we report a Keggin-type polyoxometalate [PMo10V2O40]5− with Na+ and H+ counter cations as a cathode material for Na-ion batteries. Further the formation of POM is evidenced by PXRD, FT-IR, flame photometry and XPS studies. In Na-POM, Na+ ions in the intercluster cavities provide a better pathway and easy diffusion during the charge/discharge process, and contribute to better electrochemical properties than H-POM.

We find that besides the extraction of Na+ ions from the crystal lattice to form NaOH, Na2CO3, and Na2CO3·H2O in contact with air, nickel ions gradually dissolve from the bulk to form NiO and accumulate on the particle surface as revealed by subnanometer surface-sensitive time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy. The degradation species on the surface are insulating, leading to an increase in interfacial resistance and declined electrochemical performance. We also demonstrate a feasible surface coating strategy for suppressing the unfavorable degradation process.

However, the lack of atomic-level understanding regarding the distribution of substitution positions complicates the comprehension of the roles of substituting atoms and the mechanism of sodium-ion intercalation. In this study, we identified the stable configurations of Na in Na0.75Ni0.3Mn0.7O2 and Na0.75Li0.15Mg0.05Ni0.1Mn0.7O2 materials using the site exclusion method. Through simulating the complete charging process for both materials, the structure evolution of the cathodes during the cycling and the impact of the partial substitution of Ni elements by Li and Mg atoms were comprehensively elucidated. Our findings revealed that Mg atoms effectively regulate the distribution of forces within the materials, essentially serving as supportive pillars within the cathode. Meanwhile, Li atoms efficiently mitigated electron localization, consequently diminishing volume fluctuations during the charging process. More importantly, the substitution with Li and Mg atoms could synergistically reduce the interaction between transition metals and sodium ions, thereby reducing the diffusion energy barrier of Na ions. This study not only enhances the comprehension of substituted metal atoms in P2 layered oxides but also offers new insights for the development of sodium-ion cathode materials.",

The rational design, synthesis, and characterization of a complex heterotrimetallic single-source molecular precursor for the next generation sodium-ion battery cathode material, Na2Mn2FeO6, is described. A unique pentametallic platform [MnII(ptac)3-Na-MnIII(acac)3-Na-MnII(ptac)3] (1) was derived from the known polymeric structure of [NaMnII(acac)3]∞, through a series of elaborate design procedures, such as mixed-ligand, unsymmetric ligand, and mixed-valent approaches. Importantly, the application of those techniques results in a molecule with distinctively different transition metal positions in terms of ligand environment and oxidation states. An isovalent substitution of FeIII for the central MnIII ion forms the target heterotrimetallic precursor [MnII(ptac)3-Na-FeIII(acac)3-Na-MnII(ptac)3] (3) with an appropriate metal ratio of Na:Mn:Fe = 2:2:1. The arrangement of metal ions and ligands in this pentametallic assembly was confirmed by single crystal X-ray investigation. The unambiguous assignment of the positions and oxidation states of the Periodic Table neighbors Fe and Mn in 3 has been achieved by a combination of investigative techniques that include synchrotron resonant diffraction, X-ray multiwavelength anomalous diffraction, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, Mössbauer spectroscopy, and gas-phase DART mass spectrometry. The heterotrimetallic single-source precursor 3 was shown to exhibit a clean decomposition pattern yielding the phase-pure P2-NaxMn2FeO6 quaternary oxide with high uniformity of metal ion distribution as confirmed by electron microscopy.",

        "abstract": "Environmental friendly sodium alginate (SA) cannot be used as a binder in aqueous batteries due to its high solubility in water. A water-insoluble polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) binder has been widely applied for an aqueous battery, in which the toxic and expensive organic solvent of N-methy-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) is required during the coating process. Herein, we report that the water-soluble SA can be utilized as a binder in aqueous Zn batteries because SA could cross-link with the Zn2+ ion to form a water-insoluble and mechanically super strong binder for electrodes. Aqueous Zn||LiFePO4 cells are assembled to demonstrate the performance of the SA binder for LiFePO4 cathodes. Due to the high adhesion strength of cross-linked Zn-SA, LiFePO4 with the SA binder displays a high capacity retention of 93.7% with a high Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% after 100 cycles at a 0.2 C rate, while the capacity of LiFePO4 with the PVDF binder quickly decays to 84.7% after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. In addition, the LiFePO4 cathode with the SA binder also has smaller redox polarization, faster ion diffusion rate, and more favorable electrochemical kinetics than that with the PVDF binder.",

        "abstract": "Mn-containing sodium superionic conductor (NASICON) compounds have shown considerable potential as cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to higher working voltage (V5+/V4+: 3.9 V), lower cost, and lower toxicity compared to full vanadium-based NASICON Na3V2(PO4)3. Taking Na3.3V1.7Mn0.3(PO4)3 (NVMP) as an example, its practical application is still restricted by poor electronic conductivity, sluggish intrinsic Na+ diffusion, and poor high-voltage stability. In this work, a high entropy strategy is proposed to develop Na3.3V1.613Mn0.3(Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Zr)0.1(PO4)3 (HE-NVMP) cathode for not only enabling more and rapid Na+ migration but also significantly improving deep desodiation stability. Based on theoretical calculations and experimental findings, such high entropy modification can efficiently alter the coordination environments of both V/Mn and Na sites for reducing Na+ diffusion energy barrier, increasing the occupancy of Na+ at Na(2) sites, and consolidating the structure stability. Thus, the obtained HE-NVMP delivers superior high-rate capability (91.7 mAh g-1) up to 50 C and excellent cycling performance (capacity retention: 81.2%) after 10 000 cycles at 20 C at the cutoff voltage of 4.1 V. More importantly, such cathode also exhibits superior sodium storage properties at a higher cutoff voltage (4.5 V) with electrochemical polarization with 75% reduction at 1 C and higher capacity retention of 80.3% after 2000 cycles at 20 C compared to pristine counterpart, indicating a great potential for practical rechargeable batteries with excellent overcharge resistance capability.",

With respect to PB cathodes, however, their intrinsic crystal regularity, vacancies, and coordinated water will lead to low specific capacity and poor rate performance, impeding their application. Herein, nanocubic porous Nax FeFe(CN)6 coated with polydopamine (PDA) as a coupling layer to improve its electrochemical performance is reported, inspired by the excellent adhesive property of PDA. As a cathode for sodium-ion batteries, the Nax FeFe(CN)6 electrode coupled with PDA delivers a reversible capacity of 93.8 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 0.2 A g-1 , and a discharge capacity of 72.6 mA h g-1 at 5.0 A g-1 . The sodium storage mechanism of this Nax FeFe(CN)6 coupled with PDA is revealed via in situ Raman spectroscopy. The first-principles computational results indicate that FeII sites in PB prefer to couple with the robust PDA layer to stabilize the PB structure. Moreover, the sodium-ion migration in the PB structure is enhanced after coating with PDA, thus improving the sodium storage properties. Both experiments and computational simulations present guidelines for the rational design of nanomaterials as electrodes for energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "The cycle stability and voltage retention of a Na2Mn[Fe(CN)6] (NMF) cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) has been impeded by the huge distortion from NaMnII[FeIII(CN)6] to MnIII[FeIII(CN)6] caused by the Jahn-Teller (JT) effect of Mn3+. Herein, we propose a topotactic epitaxy process to generate K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] (KMF) submicron octahedra and assemble them into octahedral superstructures (OSs) by tuning the kinetics of topotactic transformation. As the SIB cathode, the self-assembly behavior of KMF improves the structural stability and decreases the contact area with the electrolyte, thereby inhibiting the transition metal in the KMF cathode from dissolving in the electrolyte. More importantly, the KMF partly transforms into NMF with Na+ de/intercalation, and the existing KMF acts as a stabilizer to disrupt the long-range JT order of NMF, thereby suppressing the overall JT distortion. As a result, the electrochemical performances of KMF cathodes outperform NMF with a highly reversible phase transition and outstanding cycling performance, and 80% capacity retention after 1500/1300 cycles at 0.1/0.5 A g-1. This work not only promotes creative synthetic methodologies but also promotes to explore the relationship between Jahn-Teller structural deformation and cycle stability.",

        "abstract": "P2-phase layered cathodes play a pivotal role in sodium-ion batteries due to their efficient Na+ intercalation chemistry. However, limited by crystal disintegration and interfacial instability, bulk and interfacial failure plague their electrochemical performance. To address these challenges, a structural enhancement combined with surface modification is achieved through trace Y doping. Based on a synergistic combination of experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the introduction of partial Y ions at the Na site (2d) acts as a stabilizing pillar, mitigating the electrostatic repulsions between adjacent TMO2 slabs and thereby relieving internal structural stress. Furthermore, the presence of Y effectively optimizes the Ni 3d-O 2p hybridization, resulting in enhanced electronic conductivity and a notable rapid charging ability, with a capacity of 77.3 mA h g-1 at 40 C. Concurrently, the introduction of Y also induces the formation of perovskite nano-islands, which serve to minimize side reactions and modulate interfacial diffusion. As a result, the refined P2-Na0.65 Y0.025 [Ni0.33 Mn0.67 ]O2 cathode material exhibits an exceptionally low volume variation (≈1.99%), an impressive capacity retention of 83.3% even at -40 °C after1500 cycles at 1 C.",

Here, an ultra-stable and ultra-thin perylene-dicyandiamide-based hydrogen organic framework (HOF) nanosheet (P-DCD) of ≈3.5 nm in thickness is developed. When applied in the cathode, the P-DCD exhibits exceptional long-term capacity retention for alkali-ion batteries (AIBs). Strikingly, for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), at current of 2 A g-1 , the large reversible capacity of 108 mA h g-1 shows no attenuation within 5 000 cycles. For sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), the related capacity retains 91.7% within 10 000 cycles compared to the initial state, significantly much more stable than conventional organic materials reported previously. Mechanism studies through ex situ and in situ experiments and theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the impressive long-term performance retention originates from the large electron delocalization, fast ion diffusion, and physicochemical stability within the ultra-thin 2D P-DCD, featuring π-π and hydrogen bonding stacking, nitrogen-rich units, and low impedance. The advantageous features demonstrate that rationally designed stable and effective organic frameworks pave the way to utilizing complete organic materials for developing next-generation low-cost and highly stable energy storage batteries.",

Notably, at the higher rate of 5 C (1250 mA g-1), it can retain 94% of the initial capacity after 3000 cycles. It was found that the outstanding rate performance and the long-term cycling life of Na-VBNT@C are primarily due to the Na+ pseudocapacitance.

Herein, the composite materials of manganese-iron based Prussian white and reduced graphene oxide (PW/rGO) were synthesized via a one-step in situ synthesis method with sodium citrate, which was employed both as a chelating agent to control the reaction rate during the coprecipitation process of PW synthesis and as a reducing agent for GO. The low precipitation speed helps minimize lattice defects, while rGO enhances electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the one-step in situ synthesis method is simpler and more efficient than the traditional synthesis method. Compared with pure PW, the PW/rGO composites exhibit significantly improved electrochemical properties. Cycling performance tests indicated that the PW/rGO-10 sample exhibited the highest initial discharge capacity and the best cyclic stability. The PW/rGO-10 has an initial discharge capacity of 128 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C (1 C = 170 mA g-1), and retains 49.53% capacity retention after 100 cycles, while the PW only delivers 112 mAh g-1 with a capacity retention of 17.79% after 100 cycles. Moreover, PW/rGO-10 also shows better rate performance and higher sodium ion diffusion coefficient (DNa+) than the PW sample. Therefore, the incorporation of rGO not only enhances the electrical conductivity but also promotes the rapid diffusion of sodium ions, effectively improving the electrochemical performance of the composite as a cathode material for sodium-ion batteries.",

Electrochemical investigations of the ether functionalized IL electrolytes in SIB half cells (Na0.6Mn0.9Co0.1O2 as cathode material) proved their compatibility with a SIB system.

However, its intrinsically inferior electronic conductivity and structural instability result in an unfavorable rate performance and cyclability. Herein, K-doped Na5V12O32 (KNVO) was developed to promote its ionic/electronic migration, and thus enhance the Zn2+ storage capability. The as-produced KNVO displays a superior capacity of 353.5 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and an excellent retentive capacity of 231.8 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 5 A g−1. Even under a high mass of 5.3 mg cm−2, the KNVO cathode can still maintain a capacity of 220.5 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and outstanding cyclability without apparent capacity decay after 2000 cycles. In addition, the Zn2+ storage kinetics of the KNVO cathode is investigated through multiple analyses.",

We investigated the changes in the crystal structure, surface chemistry, and particle morphology caused by Ti doping and correlated these changes to the improved performance. The enhanced rate capability and cycling stability were attributed to the enlargement of the NaO2 slab in the crystal structure because of Ti doping.

        "abstract": "A cobalt-free layered Na[Ni0.55Mn0.35Fe0.1]O2(NFM) cathode material has been synthesized and dual surface and structural modifications have been performed. Bi5+ is doped into pure NFM in order to tune the structure, whereas, a thin layer of Bi2O3 is coated on surface of the Bi5+-coated NFM to modify the surface. The structure, morphology, and electrochemical performance of prepared samples are analyzed and compared by various characterization techniques. The pristine NFM cathode exhibits the specific discharge capacity of 170 mAh g-1, while Bi-doped cathode exhibits 181 mAh g-1, and Bi2O3 coated cathode renders 180 mAh g-1. It is observed that, pristine NFM cathode suffers rapid capacity degradation and nearly ~80% capacity loss within first 250 cycles. After 1000 cycles, BNFM shows 47% capacity retention, while, BNMF@Bi2O3 shows 73% capacity retention of initial capacity. This improvement in the rate capability is obtained due to the effect of Bi-doping and Bi2O3 coating, where, former enlarges interlayer spacing and latter provides the ionic conducting channel as well as protects the particle from the contact of the electrolyte. The combined effect of Bi-doping and Bi2O3 coating facilitates fast diffusion of Na-ions within the transition metal layers resulting in superior rate capability.\n \n \n Fig:\n Cyclability of pristine, Bi-doped and Bi2O3 coated NFM cathode materials\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Figure 1\n",

        "abstract": "The conventional P2-type cathode material Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 suffers from an irreversible P2–O2 phase transition and serious capacity fading during cycling. Here, we successfully carry out magnesium and calcium ion doping into the transition-metal layers (TM layers) and the alkali-metal layers (AM layers), respectively, of Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2. Both Mg and Ca doping can reduce O-type stacking in the high-voltage region, leading to enhanced cycling endurance, however, this is associated with a decrease in capacity. The results of density functional theory (DFT) studies reveal that the introduction of Mg2+ and Ca2+ make high-voltage reactions (oxygen redox and Ni4+/Ni3+ redox reactions) less accessible. Thanks to the synergetic effect of co-doping with Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions, the adverse effects on high-voltage reactions involving Ni–O bonding are limited, and the structural stability is further enhanced. The finally obtained P2-type Na0.62Ca0.025Ni0.28Mg0.05Mn0.67O2 exhibits a satisfactory initial energy density of 468.2 W h kg−1 and good capacity retention of 83% after 100 cycles at 50 mA g−1 within the voltage range of 2.2–4.35 V.

        "abstract": "Abstract Conventional sodium‐based layered oxide cathodes are extremely air sensitive and possess poor electrochemical performance along with safety concerns when operating at high voltage. The polyanion phosphate, Na3V2(PO4)3 stands out as an excellent candidate due to its high nominal voltage, ambient air stability, and long cycle life. The caveat is that Na3V2(PO4)3 can only exhibit reversible capacities in the range of 100 mAh g−1, 20% below its theoretical capacity. Here, the synthesis and characterizations are reported for the first time of the sodium‐rich vanadium oxyfluorophosphate, Na3.2Ni0.2V1.8(PO4)2F2O, a tailored derivative compound of Na3V2(PO4)3, with extensive electrochemical and structural analyses. Na3.2Ni0.2V1.8(PO4)2F2O delivers an initial reversible capacity of 117 mAh g−1 between 2.5 and 4.5 V under the 1C rate at room temperature, with 85% capacity retention after 900 cycles. The cycling stability is further improved when the material is cycled at 50 °C within 2.8–4.3 V for 100 cycles. When paired with a presodiated hard carbon, Na3.2Ni0.2V1.8(PO4)2F2O cycled with a capacity retention of 85% after 500 cycles. Cosubstitution of the transition metal and fluorine in Na3.2Ni0.2V1.8(PO4)2F2O as well as the sodium‐rich structure are the major factors behind the improvement of specific capacity and cycling stability, which paves the way for this cathode in sodium‐ion batteries.",

Sodium manganese oxide with a layered-tunnel hybrid structure was designed, synthesized, and subsequently investigated. The layered-tunnel hybrid structure provides fast Na ion diffusivity and high structural stability thanks to the tunnel phase, enabling high rate capability and greatly improved cycling stability compared to that of the pure P2 layered phase while retaining the high specific capacity of the P2 layered phase. The hybrid structure provided a decent discharge capacity of 133.4 mAh g-1 even at 8 C, which exceeds the reported best rate capability for Mn-based cathodes. It also displayed an impressive cycling stability, maintaining 83.3 mAh g-1 after 700 cycles at 10 C. Theoretical calculation and the potentiostatic intermittent titration technique (PITT) demonstrated that this hybrid structure helps enhance Na ion diffusivity during charge and discharge, attaining, as a result, an unprecendented electrochemical performance.",

        "abstract": "The iron‐based pyrophosphate Na2FeP2O7 (NFP) is considered as one of the most promising cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) due to its low‐cost and superior structure stability, yet it usually suffers from poor intrinsic electronic conductivity. Herein, a two‐step carbon‐coating technique has been developed to synthesize high‐performance NFP@C cathode materials by controlling the NFP particle size and the coating layer uniformity. The first step of in‐situ carbon coating greatly restrains the excessive growth of NFP crystals with a shortened Na‐ion diffusion path. Meantime, the extra secondary carbon‐coating is adopted to repair some exposed areas, guaranteeing the full coverage of NFP particles for rapid electronic transfer. As a consequence, the as‐obtained NFP@C cathode delivers a high discharge capacity of 95.2 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C (theoretical value: 97 mAh g−1) and with high‐rate capability (75.2 mAh g−1 at 5 C) within 2.0–4.0 V. A capacity retention of 95.3% can be achieved even after 500 cycles at 5 C in coin‐type cells. Such superior electrochemical performances are expected to quickly promote the applications of NFP in SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Worries about lithium supplies have led to the development of research on sodium batteries. Sodium-ion batteries are regarded as the next generation of energy-storage devices thanks to the generous resources of sodium. In spite of that, structural changes in the electrode materials remain the main challenge of this storage technology. NaCoO2 has been widely investigated as a competitive candidate for LiCoO2. It has been found that the electrochemical cycling curves of this material present numerous potential steps as a result of electronic transitions and/or structural ordering. From this standpoint, this paper reports a novel cathode material, Na2/3Co0.95Ti0.05O2, where 5% of cobalt was replaced by titanium, prepared via a facile solid-state route. The sodiation/desodiation mechanism of this layered material was investigated. Na//Na2/3Co0.95Ti0.05O2 exhibits a first initial capacity of 119 mAh/g in the potential window 2-4.2 V with less potential jumps in the potential versus capacity curve compared to NaCoO2. Genuinely, the electrochemistry of this material demonstrated a reversibility upon the insertion/desinertion process with low polarization. In situ synchrotron investigations on Na2/3Co0.95Ti0.05O2 reveal the occurrence of reversible ordered phases.

        "abstract": "Layered transition metal oxides are widely considered as ideal cathode materials for SIBs. However, the existing P2 and O3 structures possess specific issues, which limit their practical applications. To address these issues, this work designed a novel intergrowth layered oxide cathode with P2 and O3 phases by implementing Cu and Ti into the structure with the formation of high-entropy cathode materials with superior performance for SIBs. The electrochemical test results show that the optimized high-entropy cathode with the P2/O3 intergrowth structure possesses a high initial discharge capacity of 157.85 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C, an excellent rate performance of 84.41 mAh g-1 at 10 C, and long-term stability with capacity retention of 83.25% after 500 cycles at 5C. Furthermore, the analysis results of ex situ XRD and in situ XRD indicate that the adverse phase transition of P2-O2 under high voltage is effectively suppressed. This work indicates that the integration of high-entropy strategy with the two-phase intergrowth structure can effectively stabilize the layered structure, suppress the slipping of transition metal layers, and improve electrochemical performance, which provides a new approach for designing high-performance and practical layered transition metal oxide cathode materials for advanced SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sacrificial cathode additive as a pre-metallation method could ensure adequate metal sources for advanced energy storage devices. However, this pre-metallation technique is seriously suffered from the precise regulation of decomposition potential of additive. Herein, a molecularly compensated pre-metallation (Li/Na/K) strategy has been successfully achieved through Kolbe electrolysis, in which the electrochemical oxidation potential of metal carboxylate is manipulated by the bonding energy of oxygen-metal (O-M) moiety. As theoretically predicted, the electron-donating effect of substituent and low charge density of cation can dramatically weaken the O-M bond strength, further bringing out the reduced potential. Thus, sodium acetate exhibits a superior pre-sodiation feature for sodium-ion battery accompanied with a large irreversible specific capacity of 301.8 mAh g -1 , remarkably delivering 70. 6% enhanced capacity retention after 100 cycles. Notably, this elaborate methodology has been profoundly extended to construct high-performance lithium-ion battery and lithium/sodium/potassium-ion capacitor. This breakthrough has paved an innovative pathway for pre-metallation enabled by organic electrochemistry, offering in-depth insights into directional design of sacrificial reagent for electrochemical energy storage systems.",

Weil’s keynote explored current challenges associated with batteries as energy storage devices. It is evident that for both stationary and mobile energy storage applications batteries will play a significant role as an electrochemical energy storage technology. Particularly, lithium-ion batteries are widely used due to their technical properties, economics, and operability. However, their sustainability is being questioned due to material demand, production costs, environmental and social impacts, technical disadvantages, safety, and end-of-life treatment. Thus, there is a high necessity to develop new battery chemistries that are more environmentally friendly, techno-economically feasible, and disassociated from negative social impacts. Many new concepts such as sodium-ion, magnesium, zinc, and aluminum batteries are emerging with the promise of better sustainability. The following six presentations offered valuable perspectives on evaluating emerging battery technologies: Viera Pechancová (Tomas Bata University) delved into the social sustainability aspects of these technologies. Sebastián Pinto Bautista (KIT) presented prospective life cycle assessments (LCAs) of novel batteries, including Mg-batteries and metaland liquid-free organic batteries, whereas Manuel Baumann (KIT) discussed the toxicity screening of precursor materials for sodium-ion battery cathodes.

X‐ray diffraction (XRD) is utilized to evaluate the crystal structure transition from Co0.2‐MnO2 to NaMnO2 with discharge to 1 V, proving that Co‐doping does indeed facilitate the acceleration of ion transport and support layer spacing to stabilize the structure of MnO2. Subsequently, highly conductive (0.0848 S cm−1) gel‐type supercapacitors are prepared by combining Co0.2‐MnO2, potassium hydroxide (KOH), and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) together. Co0.2‐MnO2 provides capacitive behavior and strengthens the hydrogen bonds between molecules. KOH acts as an ion crosslinker to enhance hydrogen bond and as electrolyte to transport ions. 5 wt% Co0.2‐MnO2@KOH/PVA has superb mechanical endurance, appreciable electrical conductivity, and ideal capacitive behavior.

However, the structural defects of Mn ions inside the crystal framework reduce the sodium storage capacity, voltage plateau, and cyclic stability of the cathodes. Here, a strategy to inhibit the Mn ion defects of Na4MnCr(PO4)3 has been proposed by using different phosphate sources. It is found that Na4MnCr(PO4)3 prepared with NH4H2PO4 (NMCP-N) exhibits less noticeable voltage hysteresis than that of Na4MnCr(PO4)3 prepared with H3PO4 (NMCP-H), indicating that the site occupation defects of Mn ions in the Na4MnCr(PO4)3 crystal structure are successfully suppressed, as confirmed by theoretical calculations and structural refinements. In the case of NMCP-N, a capacity of 109.7 mAh g-1 is delivered at 0.01 A g-1, and 54.2% capacity retention can be kept after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g-1, which is much better than that of the counterpart of NMCP-H (a lower capacity of 96.1 mAh g-1 and poorer cyclability of only 22.8% capacity retention after 500 cycles), showing that the structure defects strongly affect the sodium storage properties of Na4MnCr(PO4)3 cathodes.

This approach effectively addresses the issues of grain cracking and expands the interlayer spacing of alkali metal ions in SIB materials, thereby enhancing their overall performance. Consequently, it optimizes the diffusion of charge carriers and facilitates interfacial charge transfer, leading to remarkable improvements in the performance of the NaNi0.33Mn0.33Fe0.33O2 material with 0.4 wt % amorphous aluminum oxide coating (NNMF-0.4A), which exhibits reversible capacities of 135.7, 114.3, 106.8, 99.9, 89.5, and 77.1 mAh g-1 at 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 C, respectively.

        "abstract": "Vanadate oxides with low price and high theoretical capacity are competitive cathodes for aqueous zinc‐ion batteries (AZIBs). However, the existing problems such as sluggish Zn2+ ion mobility, weak conductivity, and complicated flexible electrode preparation hinder the development of their practical applications in flexible AZIBs (FAZIBs). Herein, sodium‐ion and polyaniline are co‐inserted into ammonium vanadate (NaNVO‐PANI) nanoarrays, which can serve as the novel freestanding cathodes for FAZIBs. By virtue of synergistic pillar effect of sodium ions and polyaniline, the interplanar spacing of NaNVO‐PANI expands to ≈13.8 Å. Both experimental data and theoretical calculation confirm that the optimal spacing of NaNVO‐PANI can boost enhance the electronic conductivity and reduce Zn2+ diffusion barrier. As expected, the resulting coin‐type AZIBs exhibit high capacity of 610.7 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and remarkable capacity retention of 98% after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1. More encouragingly, quasi‐solid‐state FAZIBs with sandwich structure are assembled, achieving impressive energy density of 345.59 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 380.46 W kg−1. This study is of great significance for developing high‐performance vanadium‐based electrode for wearable FAZIBs.",

        "abstract": "Na superionic conductor (NASICON)-structured compounds demonstrate great application potential by their robust framework and compositional diversity. However, they are blamed for the mediocre energy density, and achieving both multielectron reaction and good cycling stability simultaneously is challenging. Herein, a novel heterogeneous Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)/Na2VTi(PO4)3 (NFPP/NVTP) material with stable multielectron reaction is constructed by spray drying technology. The mutual promotion effect of intergrowth structures effectively improves the purity and the crystallization of NFPP/NVTP during the fabrication process, which is beneficial to the high capacity and cycling stability. As a result, the optimized NFPP/NVTP demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 155.3 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1 and outstanding cycling stability with 82.9% capacity retention over 2500 cycles at 1 A g-1, which are much superior to those of NFPP and NVTP individually. Even in full cell configuration, the energy density remains high at ≈380 Wh kg-1 based on the cathode mass. The high capacity of NFPP/NVTP is also attributed to the successive reduction/oxidation mechanism involving the introduction of Ti3+ and interfacial charge redistribution effect between the heterogeneous phases, which greatly improve the electronic and ionic conductivity. Moreover, high reversible structural evolution during the multisodium storage process further guarantees excellent cycling stability.",

        "abstract": "The carbon coating strategy has emerged as an indispensable approach to improve the conductivity of polyanionic cathodes. However, owing to the complex reaction process between precursors of carbon and cathode, establishing a unified screening principle for carbonaceous precursors remains a technical challenge. Herein, we reveal that carbonaceous precursor pyrolysis chemistry undeniably influences the formation process and performance of Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathodes from in situ insights. By investigating three types of carbonaceous precursors, it is found that O/H-containing functional groups can provide more bonding sites for cathode precursors and generate a reducing atmosphere by pyrolysis, which is beneficial to the formation of polyanionic materials and a uniform carbon coating layer. Conversely, excessive pyrolysis of functional groups leads to a significant amount of gas, which is detrimental to the compactness of the carbon layer. Furthermore, the substantial presence of residual heteroatoms diminishes graphitization. In this case, it is demonstrated that carbon dots (CDs) precursors with suitable functional groups can comprehensively enhance the Na+ migration rate, reversibility, and interface stability of the cathode material. As a result, the NVP/CDs cathode displays outstanding capacity retention, maintaining 92% after 10,000 cycles at a high rate of 50 C. Altogether, these findings provide a valuable benchmark for carbon source selection for polyanionic cathodes.",

A training database was generated utilizing the previous 124 545 electrode databases, and a test set of 3126 potential NASICON structures [NaxMyM'1-y(PO4)3] with 27 dopants at the metal site and 6 dopants at the polyanion central site was constructed.

The thermodynamically stable configurations of doped NASICON structures were then selected using machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP), enabling rapid consideration of various dopant site configurations. DFT calculations are followed on 796 screened materials to obtain energy density, average voltage, and volume change. Finally, 50 candidates with an average voltage of ≥3.5 V are identified.

However, it has been challenging to regulate accurately the phase ratio of P2/O3 composite due to their high compositional diversity, which brings about some difficulty in manipulating the electrochemical performance of P2/O3 composite. Here, we explore the effect of Ti substitution and the synthesis temperature on the crystal structure and Na storage performance of Na0.8Ni0.4Mn0.6O2. The investigation indicates Ti-substitution and altering synthesis temperature can rationally manipulate the phase ratio of P2/O3 composite, thereby purposefully regulating the cycling and rate performance of P2/O3 composite.

Meanwhile, various advanced characterization techniques are utilized to accurately decipher the crystalline formation process, atomic arrangement, structural evolution, and inherent effect mechanisms. Surprisingly, apart from restraining the unfavorable multiphase transformation and enhancing air stability, the accurate multielement chemical substitution engineering also shows a pinning effect to alleviate the lattice strains for the high structural reversibility and enlarges the interlayer spacing reasonably to enhance Na+ diffusion, resulting in excellent comprehensive performance.

Due to their improved safety, polyanion framework compounds have recently gained attention as potential candidates. With the earth‐abundant element Fe being the redox center, the uniform carbon‐coated Na3.32Fe2.34(P2O7)2/C composite represents a promising alternative for sodium‐ion batteries. The electrochemical results show that the as‐prepared Na3.32Fe2.34(P2O7)2/C composite can deliver capacity of ≈100 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C (1 C = 120 mA g−1), with capacity retention of 92.3% at 0.5 C after 300 cycles. After adding fluoroethylene carbonate additive to the electrolyte, 89.6% of the initial capacity is maintained, even after 1100 cycles at 5 C. The electrochemical mechanism is systematically investigated via both in situ synchrotron X‐ray diffraction and density functional theory calculations. The results show that the sodiation and desodiation are single‐phase‐transition processes with two 1D sodium paths, which facilitates fast ionic diffusion. A small volume change, nearly 100% first‐cycle Coulombic efficiency, and a pseudocapacitance contribution are also demonstrated. This research indicates that this new compound could be a potential competitor for other iron‐based cathode electrodes for application in large‐scale Na rechargeable batteries.",

In the present work, we use a modified co-precipitation method to synthesize Fe-based PBAs, which has a cubic structure and offers a large Na+ insertion/extraction channel. The results show that 99.9% of the capacity (108.9 mAh g-1) retained after 100 cycles of tests for the sample with the most outstanding cycling stability (PB-15). In addition, the samples are heat-treated to remove the crystal water from the acquired PBAs. The freshly prepared PB-15 sample is further treated at 180°C. Phase transformation from the cubic structure to the monoclinic phase of the samples is probed after heat treatment. The initial specific capacity of HT-PB-15 is higher than that of PB-15 by 10.2 mAh g-1 and the capacity remained at 117.6 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles, which is the most outstanding cycling performance in the reported results.",

        "abstract": "Prussian blue (PB) has been an emerging class of cathode material for sodium-ion batteries due to its low cost and high theoretical capacity. However, their working voltage and capacity are substantially restricted due to the deactivation of low-spin Fe sites. Herein, we demonstrate a universal strategy to activate the low-spin Fe sites of PB by hybridizing them with the π-π conjugated electronic conductors. The redistribution of electron density between π-π conjugated conductors and PB effectively promotes the participation of low-spin Fe sites in sodium storage. Consequently, the low-spin Fe-induced plateau is greatly aroused, resulting in a high specific capacity of 148.4 mAh g-1 and remarkable energy density of 444.2 Wh kg-1. In addition, the excellent structural stability enables superior cycling stability over 2500 cycles and outstanding rate performance. The work will provide fundamental insight into activating the low-spin Fe sites of PB for advanced battery technologies.",

        "abstract": "Red phosphorus (P) has been recognized as a promising material for lithium/sodium ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs) because of their high theoretical capacity. However, tremendous volume variation and low conductivity limit its widespread applications. Hence, we design and synthesize uniformly distributed honeycomb-like hierarchical micro-mesoporous carbon nanospheres (HHPCNSs) with ultralarge pore volume (3.258 cm3 g-1) on a large scale through a facile way. The large pore volume provides enough space for loading of P and the expansion of P, and the uniform distribution of the micro-mesopores makes the red P loaded uniformly. The resulted HHPCNSs/P composite exhibits extremely high capacity (2463.8 and 2367.6 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 for LIBs and SIBs, respectively), splendid rate performance (842.2 and 831.1 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1 for LIBs and SIBs, respectively) and superior cycling stability (1201.6 and 938.4 mA h g-1 at 2 and 5 A g-1 after 1000 cycles for LIBs, and 1269.4 and 861.8 mA h g-1 at 2 and 5 A g-1 after 1000 cycles for SIBs, respectively). More importantly, when coupled with LiFePO4 and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, lithium/sodium-ion full batteries display high capacity, superior rate and cycling performances, revealing the practicability of HHPCNSs/P composite. The exceptional electrochemical performance is caused by the honeycomb-like carbon network with ultralarge pore volume, uniformly distributed hierarchical micro-mesoporous nanostructure, outstanding electronic conductivity and excellent nanostructural stability, which is much better than currently reported P/C materials for both LIBs and SIBs.",

We find that Na content plays a key role on the structure, morphology, and the charge-discharge performances of these materials. For x = 0.67 and 0.75, superstructure from Na+-vacancy ordering is observed, while it is absent in the x = 0.50 sample. Despite the same synthesis conditions, materials with x = 0.67 and 0.75 show smaller particle sizes compared to that of the x = 0.50 sample. In addition, redox potentials of the materials differ significantly even though they have the same transition metal ratios. These differences are attributed to the changes in local structures of the as-prepared materials arising from the different amount of Na and possibly oxygen in the lattice. Materials with x = 0.67 and 0.75 show excellent rate performance and cycle stability when tested as cathode material of SIBs. Average discharge potential is as high as 3.41 V versus Na-Na+ with capacity of 87 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1. Excellent capacity and cycle stability are maintained even when they are tested with higher current rates.

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)3 has shown great promise in next-generation cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries owning to its fast Na+ diffusion in the three-dimensional open NASICON framework and high theoretical energy density. However, Na3V2(PO4)3 suffers from undesirable rate performance and unstable cyclability arising from low electronic conductivity. Herein, we propose a facile approach for significantly enhancing the electrochemical properties of Na3V2(PO4)3 by Ti doping at V site and constructing nanoparticle@carbon core-shell nanostructure. This material design provides fast electron conduction network within the whole active particles because of the mixed valence Ti4+/3+ in bulk and highly conductive carbon shell on the surface. Lattice doping and carbon coating reduce the electrode polarization and facilitate the electrode reaction kinetics, while the nanostructure enhances the ionic conduction by shortening the diffusion distance and offers sufficient contact of active particles with organic electrolyte. The multiple synergetic effects enable a superior electrochemical performance. The optimized Na3V1.9Ti0.1(PO4)3@C cathode shows a high specific capacity (116.6 mAh g-1 at 1C), an unprecedented rate performance (93.4 mAh g-1 at 400C), and an exceptional long-term high-rate cycling stability (capacity retention of 69.5% after 14 000 cycles at 100C, corresponding to 0.0002% decay per cycle).",

However, the material suffers from severe capacity decay during the electrochemical reaction process. Herein, P2-Na0.67[Mn0.67Ni0.21Li0.06Zn0.06]O2 cathode is gained by moderately substituting lithium/zinc into the nickel sites. The inactive Li/Zn co-substitution is endowed with safeguard ability to stabilize the crystal structure, resulting in enhanced electrochemical kinetics and remarkable long cyclic performance in liquid & solid-state electrolyte. Thus the Li/Zn co-substituted cathode presents specific capacity of 154 mAh g1 at the first discharge process, excellent rate capability with 77 mAh g1 at a high current density of 5 C, and long cyclic stability in liquid-state batteries. Excitingly, it is also endowed with a high capacity retention of 85% after 500 cycles in solid-state batteries. Furthermore, a combination of ex-situ XRD, TEM and ex-situ XPS are applied to reveal the structural evolution and charge compensation mechanism of P2-Na0.67[Mn0.67Ni0.21Li0.06Zn0.06]O2, allowing a deep insight into the great significance of structural safeguard ability.",

The redesigned cathode maintains stable voltage by demonstrating reversible oxygen redox while significantly suppressing the redox activity of manganese. The anionic redox contribution capacity of the selenium‐doped Na0.6Li0.2Mn0.8O2 cathode remains as high as 84% after 50 cycles, while the pristine Na0.6Li0.2Mn0.8O2 cathode experiences a reduction to 39% of its initial capacity. The X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy data and computational analysis further revealed that selenium doping participates in redox as Se+4/5 which stabilizes the charged state and increases the energy step for O─O dimerization, thus improving the stability and lifespan of Na0.6Li0.2Mn0.8O2 cathodes.

First, we showed that the Hubbard Ucorrection within the GGA + Uapproach is necessary to correctly refer these molybdates to semiconductors. The sodium diffusion along various pathways was thoroughly examined, which allowed us to establish the most probable pathways with the lowest migration barriers. These compounds have different directions of sodium diffusion with twice different barriers that was associated to the peculiarities of their crystal structure.

However, like all known SO4-based insertion materials, its synthesis is cumbersome that warrants careful processing avoiding any aqueous exposure. Here, an alternate low temperature ionothermal synthesis has been described to produce the alluaudite Na2+2xFe(II)2-x(SO4)3.

However, the crystalline structure and the electrochemical performance of PW strongly depend on the hydration level, which is difficult to control, leading to discrepancies in the results and interpretations presented in the literature. This work aims to provide a deeper insight into the dehydration process of PW materials and a better understanding of the impact of their fast rehydration, upon exposure to moisture, on their characterization. For this purpose, a Na1.87Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.99·1.99H2O sample was synthesized by a coprecipitation method and subsequently dehydrated to remove water. After thorough characterization, our findings show that drying parameters, such as temperature and pressure, strongly influence the post-drying result. Moreover, the dehydrated samples rehydrate within minutes of exposure to air, which may explain some discrepancies observed in the literature and highlights the necessity to work under fully air-tight conditions.",

        "abstract": "High-Ni layered oxides are potential cathodes for high energy Li-ion batteries due to their large specific capacity advantage. However, the fast capacity fade by undesirable structural degradation in liquid electrolyte during long-term cycling is a stumbling block for the commercial application of high-Ni oxides. In this work, a functional gel polymer electrolyte, grafted with sodium alginate, is introduced to increase the stability of high-Ni oxide cathodes at the levels of both the particle and electrode. An in situ generated ion-conducting layer appears on the interface through the chemical interaction between transition-metal cations of the cathode and the metalophilic reticulum group in sodium alginate. Such a tailoring layer can not only enhance the interfacial compatibility on the cathode/electrolyte interface, reducing the interfacial resistance, but also inhibit the HF corrosion, suppressing the dissolution of transition-metal cations and harmful gradient distribution of components through the oxide cathode at the electrode level. Meanwhile, detrimental microcracks in oxide microspheres and between primary crystallites are impressively inhibited at the particle level. The high-Ni oxide cathode with the metalophilic gel polymer electrolyte shows excellent cycle stability with large initial capacity of 204.9 mA h g-1 at a 1.0 C rate and high discharge capacity retention within 300 cycles at high temperature.",

Herein, a topotactic syntopogenous Na3VF6/NaVF3 superlattice formulated as Na2.9V1.1F6 (NVF) was synthesized by a facile one-step low-temperature hydrothermal reaction. NVF nanoparticles show an excellent Na+ storage capacity (∼205 mAh g-1) in a high voltage window up to 4.2 V with ultralong cycling stability. That is associated with the mixed occupancy of V and Na in NVF. The multivalent V centers serve as electron reservoirs to inhibit phase transformation, and the Na-enriched Na3VF6 with better electron conductivity acts as a Na+ reservoir for effective electron transfer. Highly reversible (de)intercalation of Na+ is achieved in the channel of perovskite-type NaVF3 with structural integrity.",

        "abstract": "Sodium manganese oxide Na0.44MnO2 (NMO) in an open structure with large tunnels is of great interest for sodium-ion battery cathode materials due to its high electrode voltage and capacity. However, its practical application is limited by poor rate performance, which can be tuned and improved by controlling point defects. We herein present a comprehensive study of intrinsic point defects in NMO using density functional theory (DFT) calculations in combination with thermodynamics. Using the DFT+U approach, we determine the formation energies of elementary defects and defect complexes depending on the sets of atomic chemical potentials, corresponding to a certain thermodynamic condition for the synthesis of stable NMO. Sodium interstitials are found to have the lowest formation energies in the relevant ranges of temperature and pressure. Other intrinsic point defects such as oxygen vacancies, sodium vacancies and manganese antisites can also be formed with proper formation energies and have an impact on the cathode performance. Compared to the perfect system, oxygen vacancies lower the electrode voltage, whereas manganese vacancies and antisites increase the voltage. We find that most point defects and defect complexes improve the sodium ion diffusivity, highlighting a proper control of defect formation for enhancing the performance of sodium-ion batteries.",

        "title": "Ab Initio Study of Sodium Insertion in the λ-Mn2O4 and Dis/Ordered λ-Mn1.5Ni0.5O4 Spinels",
        "abstract": "The main challenge of sodium-ion batteries is cycling stability, which is usually compromised due to strain induced by sodium insertion. Reliable high-voltage cathode materials are needed to compensate the generally lower operating voltages of Na-ion batteries compared to Li-ion ones. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) computations were used to evaluate the thermodynamic, structural, and kinetic properties of the high voltage λ-Mn2O4 and λ-Mn1.5Ni0.5O4 spinel structures as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Determination of the enthalpies of formation reveal the reaction mechanisms (phase separation vs solid solution) during sodiation, while structural analysis underlines the importance of minimizing strain to retain the metastable sodiated phases. For the λ-Mn1.5Ni0.5O4 spinel, a thorough examination of the Mn/Ni cation distribution (dis/ordered variants) was performed. The exact sodiation mechanism was found to be dependent on the transition metal ordering in a similar fashion to the insertion behavior observed in the Li-ion system. The preferred reaction mechanism for the perfectly ordered spinel is phase separation throughout the sodiation range, while in the disordered spinel, the phase separation terminates in the 0.625 < x < 0.875 concentration range and is followed by a solid solution insertion reaction. Na-ion diffusion in the spinel lattice was studied using DFT as well. Energy barriers of 0.3–0.4 eV were predicted for the pure spinel, comparing extremely well with the ones for the Li-ion and being significantly better than the barriers reported for multivalent ions. Additionally, Na-ion macroscopic diffusion through the 8a-16c-8a 3D network was demonstrated via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. For the λ-Mn1.5Ni0.5O4, MD simulations at 600 K bring forward a normal to inverse spinel half-transformation, common for spinels at high temperatures, showing the contrast in Na-ion diffusion between the normal and inverse lattice. The observed Ni migration to the tetrahedral sites at room temperature MD simulations explains the kinetic limitations experienced experimentally. Therefore, this work provides a detailed understanding of the (de)sodiation mechanisms of high voltage λ-Mn2O4 and λ-Mn1.5Ni0.5O4 spinel structures, which are of potential interest as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Gel electrolytes hold promise for stabilizing zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs), but achieving both high ionic conductivity and strong mechanical properties remains challenging. This work presents a double network gel electrolyte based on poly(N-hydroxymethyl acrylamide) (PNMA) and sodium alginate (SA), overcoming this trade-off. The PNMA network provides mechanical strength and water retention, while the SA network facilitates rapid zinc-ion (Zn2+) diffusion through tailored solvation. This double network gel exhibits a tensile strength of up to 838 kPa, significantly higher than previous reports. The SA network provides ion channels for rapid transport of hydrated Zn2+, enhancing the ionic conductivity to a ground-breaking 33.1 mS cm-1. This value is even higher than the liquid electrolytes. The growth of Zn dendrites is also suppressed due to the mechanical constraint and rapid ion conduction. In symmetrical cells, the PNMA/SA gel demonstrates exceptional cycling stability (>2000 h). Characterizations show this is because of reduced free water amount, hindering cathode material dissolution. The full cells with sodium vanadate cathode manifest a high capacity (364.8 mA h g-1 at 0.5 A g-1) and excellent capacity retention (83% after 2500 cycles at 10 A g-1). This double network design offers a way to achieve high-performance and stable ZIBs.",

Besides, the cathode also exhibits outstanding fast charge capacity in terms of the cyclability and capacity with 105 mAh g-1 at 5 C/1 C, corresponding 94.3% retention after 500 cycles.

        "abstract": "Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) show promise as cathodes for sodium-ion batteries due to their notable cycle stability, cost-effectiveness, and eco-friendly nature, yet the presence of interstitial water limits the specific capacity and obstructs Na+ mobility within the material. Although considerable experimental efforts are focused on dehydrating water for capacity enhancement, there is still a deficiency of a comprehensive understanding of the low capacity of low-spin Fe resulting from interstitial water, which holds significance in Na+ storage. This study introduces a novel gas-assisted heat treatment method to efficiently remove interstitial water from Fe-based PBA (NaFeHCF) electrodes and combines experiments and theoretical calculations to reveal the iron spin state regulation that is related to the capacity enhancement mechanism. This dehydration strategy significantly enhances battery capacity, especially the portion at higher voltages (3.4-4.0 V). The increase in capacity is attributed to the following factors: an enhanced proportion of Fe2+, reduced water content which facilitates faster charge transfer, and the activation of low spin Fe2+. The optimized NaFeHCF demonstrated impressive half-cell performance of retaining 87.3% capacity after 2000 cycles at a 5 C rate and achieving 100 mAh g-1 capacity over 200 cycles when being paired with hard carbon, exhibiting its practical potential.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion battery (SIB) is a candidate for the stationary energy storage systems because of the low cost and high abundance of sodium. However, the energy density and lifespan of SIBs suffer severely from the irreversible consumption of the Na-ions for the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and other side reactions on the electrodes. Here, Na3.5C6O6 is proposed as an air-stable high-efficiency sacrificial additive in the cathode to compensate for the lost sodium. It is characteristic of low desodiation (oxidation) potential (3.4-3.6 V vs. Na+/Na) and high irreversible desodiation capacity (theoretically 378 mAh g-1). The feasibility of using Na3.5C6O6 as a sodium compensation additive is verified with the improved electrochemical performances of a Na2/3Ni1/3Mn1/3Ti1/3O2ǀǀhard carbon cells and cells using other cathode materials. In addition, the structure of Na3.5C6O6 and its desodiation path are also clarified on the basis of comprehensive physical characterizations and the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This additive decomposes completely to supply abundant Na ions during the initial charge without leaving any electrochemically inert species in the cathode. Its decomposition product C6O6 enters the carbonate electrolyte without bringing any detectable negative effects. These findings open a new avenue for elevating the energy density and/or prolonging the lifetime of the high-energy-density secondary batteries.",

        "abstract": "Sodium super ionic conductor (NASICON) Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is a type of promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) with superior structural integrity, high energy density, and fast diffusion of sodium ions. However, NVP suffers from intrinsically low electrical conductivity, which results in poor rate performance. Herein, we report on the outstanding cathode performance of Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP@C-ZIF67) wrapped by the ZIF-67-derived carbon, which was prepared by sol-gel method and solid-phase method. Electrochemical measurements show an initial discharge-specific capacity of 135 mA h g-1 at 1 C, and the discharge capacity maintains 82 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles at 10 C. The results indicate the improvement in electrical conductivity and electrochemical performance due to the Co doping from ZIF-67. Moreover, we calculate the diffusion coefficient of sodium ions by the cyclic voltammetry (CV, DNa+ = 1.521 × 10-11 and 2.3484 × 10-11 cm2 s-1 for charging and discharging, respectively) and the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT, DNa+ ranges from 10-11-10-15 cm2 s-1). The exceptional performance is ascribed to the excellent structural stability and outstanding electrical conductivity of NVP modified by porous carbon skeleton and ZIF-67-derived carbon.",

        "abstract": "Recently, aqueous zinc-ion batteries have become a hot research topic in the field of grid-scale application, which can be attributed to their low-cost, aqueous electrolyte and dominant theoretical reversible capacity. Nevertheless, the lack of suitable cathode materials greatly hinders the development of aqueous zinc-ion batteries. In this work, we adopt a simple one-step synthesis strategy to prepare (NH4)2V6O16 with an intercalation of Na+ and H2O, which exhibits a novel crystal structure in which the ammonium ion, crystal water, and sodium ion co-locate in the V3O8 layers. The co-intercalation not only effectively enhances the binding energy between V-O layers to suppress vanadium dissolution but also successfully improves the structural stability to alleviate the structural collapse during the cyclic process. As result, (NH4)2V6O16 with the intercalation of crystal water and Na+ presents a remarkable reversible discharge capacity of 423.9 mA h g-1 after 90 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 with an excellent energy density of 350.3 W h kg-1 and demonstrates an outstanding specific capacity of 182.5 mA h g-1 at the high current density of 5 A g-1 upon 1400 cycles during the ultra-wide voltage window of 0.1-2.0 V.",

In this study, the Ni/Fe/Mn elements are replaced successfully with tantalum (Ta) in the NFM lattice, which generated additional delocalized electrons and enhanced the binding ability between the transition metal and oxygen, resulting in suppressed lattice distortion during charging and discharging. This caused significant mitigation of voltage decay and improved cycle stability within the potential range of 2.0–4.2 V. The optimized Na(Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3)0.97Ta0.03O2 sample achieved a reversible capacity of 162.6 mAh g−1 at a current rate of 0.1 C and 73.2 mAh g−1 at a high rate of 10 C.

The deficient sodium in P2-type cathode easily induces the terrible structural stability at deep desodiation state and limited reversible capacity during Na + de/insertion. These drawbacks cause poor rate capability and fast capacity decay in most P2-type layered oxides. To migrate these challenges, we develop a novel high sodium-content (0.85) and plateau-free P2-type cathode-Na 0.85 Li 0.12 Ni 0.22 Mn 0.66 O 2 (P2-NLNMO). The complete solid solution reaction in wide voltage range ensures both small volume variation (1.7 %) and fast Na + kinetics (10 - 11 cm 2 s - 1 ). The high sodium-content P2-NLNMO exhibits a higher reversible capacity of 123.4 mA h g - 1 , superior rate capacity of 79.3 mA h g -1  at 20 C and 85.4% of capacity retention after 500 cycles at 5 C.

        "abstract": "Enhancing the kinetics of lattice oxygen redox (LOR) in P2‐type layered sodium oxide cathodes is crucial for the advancement of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) with superior energy and power densities. Electronic structure regulation stands out as a highly effective approach to address the inherent limitations of P2‐type layered oxides with LOR, including sluggish kinetics, phase transitions, voltage hysteresis, and local structural distortion. Herein, a strategy involving the introduction of CoO6 octahedra with π‐interaction into Na0.6Li0.1Fe0.3−xCoxMn0.6O2 (x = 0, 0.15, 0.3) cathodes to facilitate Na‐ion transport is proposed. Furthermore, the impact of FeO6 octahedra with σ‐interaction in P2‐type cathodes on electrochemical performance is comprehensively investigated. Through multimodal in‐situ and ex‐situ characterization techniques, it is revealed that Co─O with π‐interaction effectively mitigates P2‐OP4 phase transitions by strengthening Na─O, reduces voltage hysteresis, and stabilizes the local structure. Consequently, Na0.6Li0.1Co0.3Mn0.6O2 demonstrates enhanced Na‐ion diffusion kinetics, leading to improved rate performance and a reversible capacity of 55 mAh g−1 at 10 C, significantly outperforming cathodes with Fe─O σ‐interaction. Moreover, when coupled with hard carbon, the full cell achieves a remarkable energy density of 395 Wh kg−1 (on cathode) at 0.1 C, with a capacity retention of 75% over 100 cycles at 1 C.",

However, the poor electronic conductivity limits the electrochemical performance of NVPOF. Herein, we fabricate N/P-dual-doped carbon coated NVPOF microspheres (labeled as NVPOF@P/N/C) via a hydrothermal process followed by heat treatment. This microsphere-structured NVPOF@P/N/C composite has a relatively high tap density of 1.22 g cm-3. TEM and XPS results reveal that the dual-doped carbon layer is tightly coated on the NVPOF surface due to the bridging effect of P and has a good protective effect on NVPOF. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that N/P-dual-doped carbon layer is advantageous to achieve higher electronic conductivity and lower migration activation energy than the undoped and single N- or P-doped carbon layer. As cathode material for sodium-ion battery (SIB), the NVPOF@P/N/C exhibits high capacity (128 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C and 122 mAh g-1 at 2 C) and ultra-long cycle performance (only 0.037% capacity fading rate per cycle in 500 cycles at 2 C).

However, originating from the rapid crystal growth, PBAs still suffer from considerable vacancy defects and interstitial water, making the preparation of long-cycle-life PBAs the greatest challenge for its practical application. Herein, a novel equilibrium chelation strategy is first proposed to synthesize a high crystallinity (94.7%) PBAs, which is realized by modulating the chelating potency of strong chelating agents via \"acid effect\" to achieve a moderate chelating effect, forcefully breaking through the bottleneck of poor cyclic stability for PBAs cathodes. Impressively, the as-prepared highly crystalline PBAs represent an unprecedented level of electrochemical performance including ultra-long lifespan (10000 cycles with 86.32% capacity maintenance at 6 A g-1), excellent rate capability (82.0 mAh g-1 at 6 A g-1).

The orthorhombic β-Na2FePO4F material has been studied extensively and intensively since it was proposed. In this article, a novel monoclinic sodium phosphate fluoride α-Na2FePO4F is concerned. Kirsanova's experiment showed that Na and Fe ions in α-Na2FePO4F are prone to antisite, leading to strong antisite disorder. Through first-principle calculations, we show that the steric effect, the magnetic exchange and superexchange interactions between transition-metal cations are shown to be the main driving forces for Na+/Fe2+ antisite disorder. We first calculated the crystal structures, electronic properties, and cohesive energies of all the 10 antisite phases of α-Na2FePO4F and β-Na2FePO4F. Then, we compared the difference charge densities, magnetism, binding energies, and electrostatic potentials of α-Na2FePO4F and β-Na2FePO4F materials in the antisite and pristine phases. In α-Na2FePO4F, the binding energy of the antisite phase with the lowest binding energy is almost degenerate with that of the pristine phase. Moreover, only small differences of the electrostatic potential and the charge density distribution are found between the antisite (with lowest energy) and the pristine phases of α-Na2FePO4F, which also helped elaborate the facile formation of Na+/Fe2+ antisite in the α-Na2FePO4F material.

However, olivine NaFePO4 only can be synthesized from olivine LiFePO4. Accordingly, in this proposal, developing the continuous flow electrochemical solid-liquid reactor-based metal ion insertion technology is to utilize the olivine FePO4, recycled from LiFePO4, and to synthesize NaFePO4.

In addition, the highly reversible phase evolution of the NLNZM is confirmed through in situ XRD results, thereby ensuring the stability of the structure with low volume change rate (0.78%). Furthermore, Li and Zn can reduce the surface energy and increase the interlayered distance to achieve rapid interfacial kinetics. As a result, the NLNZM has exhibited a high reversible capacity of 152.8 mAh g-1 and an outstanding rate performance of 103.4 mAh g-1 at 5C.

Nevertheless, the intricate phase transitions during the charging-discharging significantly impede its practical application. This paper proposes a strategy for successfully synthesizing NaNi0.5Mn0.3Ti0.2O2 (NNMT) by combining coprecipitation and a high-temperature solid-state method. This method introduces Ti elements while retaining the electrochemically active Ni2+ content, thus, the NNMT has a high initial specific capacity of 151.4 mAh g-1 at 1 C. It is demonstrated that introducing Ti4+ leads to the transition metal layers becoming disordered by ex situ XRD, thus mitigating the irreversible phase transition of the material. In addition, Ti4+ does not have an outer electron, which can reduce electron delocalization in the transition metal layer and improve the material's cyclic stability. The NNMT possesses a capacity retention rate of 60.66% after 150 cycles, much higher than the initial NNM's 18.96%. It also exhibits an excellent discharge capacity of 86.8 mAh g-1 at 5 C. In conclusion, the cycling and rate performance of the Ti-substituted NNMT are greatly improved without capacity loss, which offers innovative concepts for the modification means of the SIBs layered oxide cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "Although sodium ion batteries (NIBs) have gained wide interest, their poor energy density poses a serious challenge for their practical applications. Therefore, high-energy-density cathode materials are required for NIBs to enable the utilization of a large amount of reversible Na ions. This study presents a P2-type Na0.67Co1-xTixO2 (x < 0.2) cathode with an extended potential range higher than 4.4 V to present a high specific capacity of 166 mAh g-1. A group of P2-type cathodes containing various amounts of Ti is prepared using a facile synthetic method. These cathodes show different behaviors of the Na+/vacancy ordering. Na0.67CoO2 suffers severe capacity loss at high voltages due to irreversible structure changes causing serious polarization, while the Ti-substituted cathodes have long credible cycleability as well as high energy. In particular, Na0.67Co0.90Ti0.10O2 exhibits excellent capacity retention (115 mAh g-1) even after 100 cycles, whereas Na0.67CoO2 exhibits negligible capacity retention (<10 mAh g-1) at 4.5 V cutoff conditions. Na0.67Co0.90Ti0.10O2 also exhibits outstanding rate capabilities of 108 mAh g-1 at a current density of 1000 mA g-1 (7.4 C). Increased sodium diffusion kinetics from mitigated Na+/vacancy ordering, which allows high Na+ utilization, are investigated to find in detail the mechanism of the improvement by combining systematic analyses comprising TEM, in situ XRD, and electrochemical methods.",

Specifically, the discharge specific capacity of the sample still remains 87.5 mAh/g at a high rate of 15C after 100th cycle.

        "abstract": "Recently, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have received considerable attention for large-scale energy storage applications. However, the low initial Coulombic efficiency of traditional SIBs severely impedes their further development. Here, a highly active Na2 S-based composite is employed as a self-sacrificial additive for sodium compensation in SIBs. The in situ synthesized Na2 S is wrapped in a carbon matrix with nanoscale particle size and good electrical conductivity, which helps it to achieve a significantly enhanced electrochemical activity as compare to commercial Na2 S. As a highly efficient presodiation additive, the proposed Na2 S/C composite can reach an initial charge capacity of 407 mAh g-1 . When 10 wt.% Na2 S/C additive is dispersed in the Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 cathode, and combined with a hard carbon anode, the full cell achieves 24.3% higher first discharge capacity, which corresponds to a 18.3% increase in the energy density from 117.2 to 138.6 Wh kg-1 . Meanwhile, it is found that the Na2 S additive does not generate additional gas during the initial charging process, and under an appropriate content, its reaction product has no adverse impact on the cycling stability and rate performance of SIBs. Overall, this work establishes Na2 S as a highly effective additive for the construction of advanced high-energy-density SIBs.",

Conventional electrolytes do not contribute to charge storage in battery systems, but redox-active electrolytes augment this property via charge transfer reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface. The capacity of the cathode combined with that provided by the electrolyte redox reaction thus increases overall charge storage. An aqueous sodium hexacyanoferrate (Na4 Fe(CN)6 ) solution is employed as the redox-active electrolyte (Na-FC) and sodium nickel Prussian blue (Nax -NiBP) as the Na+ ion insertion/de-insertion cathode. The capacity of DESIB with Na-FC electrolyte is twice that of a battery using a conventional (Na2 SO4 ) electrolyte.

        "abstract": "Layered oxides are promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries because of their high theoretical capacities. However, many of these layered materials experience severe capacity decay when operated at high voltage (>4.25 V), hindering their practical application. It is essential to design high-voltage layered cathodes with improved stability for high-energy-density operation. Herein, nano P2-Na2/3(Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13)O2 (NCM) materials are synthesized using a modified Pechini method as a prospective high-voltage sodium storage component without any modification. The changes in the local ionic state around Ni, Mn, and Co ions with respect to the calcination temperature are recorded using X-ray absorption fine structure analysis. Among the electrodes, NCM fired at 850 °C (NCM-850) exhibits excellent electrochemical properties with an initial capacity and energy density of 148 mAh g–1 and 555 Wh kg–1, respectively, when cycled between 2 and 4.5 V at 160 mA g–1 along with improved cyclic stability after 100 charge/discharge cycles. In addition, the NCM-850 electrode is capable of maintaining a 75 mAh g–1 capacity even at a current density of 3200 mA g–1. In contrast, the cell fabricated with NCM obtained at 800 °C shows continuous capacity fading because of the formation of an impurity phase during the synthesis process. The obtained capacity, rate performance, and energy density along with prolonged cyclic life for the cell fabricated with the NCM-850 electrodes are some of the best reported values for sodium-ion batteries as compared to those of other p2-type sodium intercalating materials.",

        "abstract": "Na‐superionic‐conductor (NASICON)‐type cathodes (e.g., Na3V2(PO4)3) have attracted extensive attention due to their open and robust framework, fast Na+ mobility, and superior thermal stability. To commercialize sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), higher energy density and lower cost requirements are urgently needed for NASICON‐type cathodes. Herein, Na3.5V1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 (NVFP) is designed by an Fe‐substitution strategy, which not only reduces the exorbitant cost of vanadium, but also realizes high‐voltage multielectron reactions. The NVFP cathode can deliver extraordinary capacity (148.2 mAh g−1), and decent cycling durability up to 84% after 10 000 cycles at 100 C. In situ X‐ray diffraction and ex situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations reveal reversible structural evolution and redox processes (Fe2+/Fe3+, V3+/V4+, and V4+/V5+) during electrochemical reactions. The low ionic‐migration energy barrier and ideal Na+‐diffusion kinetics are elucidated by density functional theory calculations. Combined with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fe with unpaired electrons in the 3d orbital is inseparable from the higher‐valence redox activation. More competitively, coupling with a hard carbon (HC) anode, HC//NVFP full cells demonstrate high‐rate capability and long‐duration cycling lifespan (3000 stable cycles at 50 C), along with material‐level energy density up to 304 Wh kg−1.

        "title": "Power Density of a Magnesium Air Fuel Cell with Titanium Dioxide Added to Activated Carbon Derived from Marine Plastic Waste",
        "abstract": "Plastic waste is widely recognized as one of the major sources of marine pollution. Not only does it have a severe effect on marine ecology, but it also releases cancerogenic chemicals into the waterways. The amount of global plastic waste has doubled from 234 million tonnes in 2000 to 460 million tonnes in 2019, of which only 9% was recycled. In 2010, an estimated 275 million tonnes of plastic waste were collected from 192 countries located in coastal areas, with approximately 4.8–12 million tonnes ultimately finding their way into the seas and oceans. Global health, animal wildlife, and the environment are bearing a hefty price [1].\n In addition to increasing demand for portable energy storage in electronics and electric vehicles, batteries better than the current Li-ion batteries (LIBs) are a necessity. Magnesium (Mg) ion batteries have emerged as an attractive alternative because of the unique advantages of Mg metal. These include as large specific capacity, easy handling, high abundance, and theoretically smooth electrodeposition on Mg metal [2]. In addition, the reasons why magnesium is attracting attention as a battery include the following. A magnesium battery has been proposed as a promising multivalent-ion battery candidates due to its large specific capacity, high energy density, high security, low cost, low equivalent weight and low toxicity. Moreover, it shows many advantages in comparison with the widely used lithium ion batteries. Firstly, Mg ions are present in the form of +2 valence cations, implying that its energy storage density is twice of that of Li ion battery. Secondly, an Mg battery has a higher volume capacity than graphite and, even lithium ion batteries. Furthermore, an Mg element is an environmental element and abundant in the earth’s crust [3]. In this research, we developed electrode materials for magnesium air fuel cells using marine plastic waste, mainly Poly Ethylene Terephthalate, and aimed to apply them to energy storage device materials and reduce waste.\n The first step in the procedure was to produce activated carbon. Activated carbon is a carbon with micropores made from carbon materials such as coal and coconut shells by reacting them with gases and chemicals at high temperatures. Compared to charcoal, activated carbon has smaller micropores, larger specific surface area, and higher adsorption performance, and is used as a food additive and medicinal charcoal. Activated carbon was prepared by the two-step activation of organic materials (i.e., Poly Ethylene Terephthalate). The resulting activated carbon, conductivity aid, and binding material were added and mixed. Titanium dioxide was added as an additive. Currently, the annual production of titanium dioxide exceeds 4 million tonnes, and this molecule is used as an excipient in the pharmaceutical industry, in the production of sunscreen creams in the cosmetics industry, as a colorant in white plastics, and as a relatively inexpensive non-toxic food pigment approved by the relevant EU authorities regarding food additive safety, it is used in numerous household products. Its high dielectric constant gives the material many capabilities, such as its use as an antireflective surface and as a dielectric gate material in metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors [4]. The mixed activated carbon and titanium dioxide were prepared in three different ratios (1:1, 1:5, and 1:10) and mixed further. The mixture was then used to prepare two types of cathode materials. Magnesium-air fuel cells with sizes of 10 mm × 10 mm were also fabricated. Sodium polyacrylate was used as the solid electrolyte. The electrolyte was then prepared with a 1:25 ratio of sodium polyacrylate to a 3.0% NaCl concentration solution. The current and voltage were measured when connected to a solid electrolyte 1:25, 40kΩ~1Ω resistance, and the current density per reaction area, weight, and volume of the magnesium air fuel cell were calculated to obtain the power density. The maximum power density was 7.18 mW/cm2 at 1:25 without titanium dioxide added, 2.02 mW/cm2 at 1:1, 4.23 mW/cm2 at 1:5, and 4.06 mW/cm2 at 1:10 with titanium dioxide added.\n The results show that the power density was highest when titanium dioxide was not blended. Initially, it was considered that the power density would increase due to the high ionic conductivity of titanium dioxide, but this was not the case. The reason for this is thought to be that the redox reaction did not work due to the oxide film of titanium dioxide. In the future, titanium dioxide will be treated with hydrochloric acid to eliminate the oxide film so that the redox reaction can take place.\n \n \n \n \n Figure 1\n",

However, the eco-efficient and environmentally friendly fabrication of separators with a high mechanical strength, excellent thermal stability, and good electrolyte wettability is still challenging. Herein, we reported the fabrication of a new type of separators for Li/Na-ion batteries through the self-assembly of eco-friendly chitin nanofibers derived from prawn shells. We demonstrated that the pore size in the chitin nanofiber membrane (CNM) separator can be tuned by adjusting the amount of pore generation agent (sodium dihydrogen citrate) in the self-assembly process of chitin nanofibers. By optimizing the pore size in CNM separators, the electrochemical performance of the LiFePO4/Li half-cell with a CNM separator is comparable to that with a commercialized polypropylene (PP) separator. More attractively, the CNM separator showed a much better performance in the LiFePO4/Li cell at 120 °C and Na3V2(PO4)3/Na cell than the PP separator. The proposed fabrication of separators by using natural raw materials will play a significant contribution to the sustainable development of renewable energy storage systems.",

Herein, we prepared carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3 anchored on freestanding graphite foam (denoted as NVP@C-GF) as a cathode for SIBs. The NVP@C-GF exhibits superior sodium-ion storage performance, including rate capability (56 mAh g-1 at 200 C) and long cycle life (54 mAh g-1 at 100 C after 20 000 cycles). The resulting NVP@C-GF inherits the advantages of 3D free-standing graphite that possesses high electrical conductivity and porous structure for the electrolyte to soak in. Furthermore, carbon-coated NVP particles anchored on the surface of GF not only accommodate the volume change of NVP during charge/discharge but also reduce the diffusion distance of the Na+ ion.",

        "abstract": "The safety of the P2-type layered transition metal oxides (P2-NaxTMO2), a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), is a prerequisite for grid-scale energy storage systems. However, previous thermal runaway studies mainly focused on morphological changes resulting from gas production detection and thermogravimetric analysis, while the structural transition and chemical reactions underlying these processes are still unclear. Herein, a comprehensive methodology to unveil an interplay mechanism among phase structures, interfacial microcrack, and thermal stability of the charged P2-Na0.8Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 (NNMO) and the P2-Na0.8Ni0.21Li0.12Mn0.67O2 (NNMO-Li) at elevated temperatures is established. Combining a series of crystallographic and thermodynamic characterization techniques, the specific chemical reactions occurring in the NNMO materials during thermal runaway are clarified first and solidly proved that Li doping effectively hinders the dissolution of transition metal ions, reduces oxygen release, and enhances thermal stability at elevated temperatures. Importantly, based on Arrhenius and nonisothermal kinetic equations, the kinetic triplet model is successfully constructed to in-depth elucidate the thermal decomposition reaction mechanism of P2-NaxTMO2, demonstrating that such thermodynamic assessment provides a new perspective for building high-safety SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Inorganic solid-state electrolytes have attracted enormous attention due to their potential safety, increased energy density, and long cycle-life benefits. However, their application in solid-state batteries is limited by unstable electrode-electrolyte interface, poor point-to-point physical contact, and low utilization of metallic anodes. Herein, interfacial engineering based on sodium (Na)-conductive polymeric solid-state interfacial adhesive is studied to improve interface stability and optimize physical contacts, constructing a robust organic-rich solid electrolyte interphase layer to prevent dendrite-induced crack propagation and security issues. The interfacial adhesive strategy significantly increases the room-temperature critical current density of inorganic Na-ion conductors from 0.8 to 3.2 mA cm-2 and markedly enhances the cycling performance of solid-state batteries up to 500 cycles, respectively. Particularly, the Na3V2(PO4)3-based full solid-state batteries with high cathode loading of 10.16 mg cm-2 also deliver an excellent cycling performance, further realizing the stable operation of solid-state laminated pouch cells. The research provides fundamental perspectives into the role of interfacial chemistry and takes the field a step closer to realizing practical solid-state batteries.",

        "abstract": "Manganese-based layered oxides are prospective cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their low cost and high theoretical capacities. The biphasic intergrowth structure of layered cathode materials is essential for improving the sodium storage performance, which is attributed to the synergistic effect between the two phases. However, the in-depth formation mechanism of biphasic intergrowth materials remains unclear. Herein, the layered/tunnel intergrowth Na0.6MnO2 (LT-NaMO) as a model material was successfully prepared, and their formation processes and electrochemical performance were systematically investigated. In situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction displays the detailed evolution process and excellent thermal stability of the layered/tunnel intergrowth structure. Furthermore, severe structural strain and large lattice volume changes are significantly mitigated by the interlocking effect between the phase interfaces, which further enhances the structural stability of the cathode materials during the charging/discharging process. Consequently, the LT-NaMO cathode displays fast Na+ transport kinetics with a remarkable capacity retention of ∼70.5% over 300 cycles at 5C, and its assembled full cell with hard carbon also exhibits high energy density. These findings highlight the superior electrochemical performance of intergrowth materials due to interlocking effects between layered and tunnel structures and also provide unique insights into the construction of intergrowth cathode materials for SIBs.",

        "title": "Structural and Electrochemical Investigation of 3D Tunnel Type Li0.44MnO2 Cathode Material for Secondary Li-Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "The design of new cathode materials remains a key goal in the development of (post) Li-ion batteries. In that regard, densely packed structures like Li0.44MnO2 are judicious for study. The presence of Mn as a transition metal makes it more attractive due to its sustainable nature, low cost, elemental abundance, structural diversity/polymorphism, and rich oxidation states (2+ to 7+) offering tunable redox potential [1]. Here, we have investigated Mn-based tunnel-type Li0.44MnO2 oxide for secondary LIBs.\n i) Li44MnO2 (LMO) was prepared by a soft chemical method using the corresponding sodium manganese oxide (Na0.44MnO2) as a parent compound [2]. The crystal structure of Li0.44MnO2 maintains the parent Na0.44MnO2-type tunnel structure which is analogous to Na4Mn4Ti5O18 having an orthorhombic (s.g. Pbam) crystal system [3]. To understand redox chemistry, this material was studied for both cationic (Mn) and anionic (O) redox reactions using ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The lithium (de)insertion mechanism of Li0.44MnO2 was explored involving ab initio calculations and in-situ X-ray diffraction experiments. Combined with electrochemical measurements, structural characterizations, and first principles DFT calculations revealed the capacity correlated strongly with both cationic and anionic redox reactions.\n ii) We have studied the phase transition of Li44MnO2 from a 3D tunnel-type structure to a cubic spinel structure by in-situ X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The mechanism of transformation was elucidated by employing transmission electron microscopy. In this case, diffusion-less transformation occurs involving the rearrangement of atoms during heating [4]. An increase in the average redox potential from the pristine orthorhombic phase to the final spinel phase was observed by electrochemical studies.\n iii) Further to improve the electrochemical performance of Li0.44MnO2, Ti was used as a dopant. The Li0.44[Mn1-xTix]O2 (x=0, 0.11, 0.22, 0.33, 0.44, 0.56) series were obtained with chemical ion exchange from Na precursors. The Na precursors (Na0.44[Mn1-xTix]O2) were prepared via a simple solid-state route. Ti-substituted compositions exhibited similar crystal structures to their parent LMO i.e. orthorhombic framework with Pbam symmetry. A tunnel-type morphology was observed in all cases. The electrochemical performance of Ti-substituted LMO as cathode material for LIBs was studied in a half-cell configuration. The structure and electrochemical properties of Ti-doped LMO, reaching the highest capacity of 128 mAh/g, will be described.\n \n Keywords: batteries; cathode; tunnel type manganese oxides; phase transformation; doping\n \n References:\n \n [1] N.

The low practical capacity and poor cycling stability of PBAs, however, limit their wide practical deployment. To address these issues, a new strategy is deployed through introducing Fe vacancies and Cu‐dopant into the PBAs frame structure, boosting the specific capacity and improving the cycling stability. On the one hand, the introduction of Fe vacancies in PBA (PBA□Fe) can provide additional storage sites and facilitate Na+ diffusion kinetics, yielding a high capacity of ≈164 mAh g−1 at a low current density which approaches the theoretical capacity. On the other hand, the Cu‐dopant is further helpful in stabilizing the structure of PBA□Fe, thus improving the cycling stability. This work paves a new strategy that enables unlocking the capacity and improving the cycling stability of PBA materials toward high‐performance SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The development of advanced cathode materials is still a great interest for sodium-ion batteries. The feasible commercialization of sodium-ion batteries relies on the design and exploitation of suitable electrode materials. This study offers a new insight into material design to exploit high-performance P2-type cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. The incorporation of Mg2+ into intrinsic Na+ vacancies in Na-ion layers can lead to a high-performance P2-type cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. The materials prepared by the coprecipitation approach show a well-defined morphology of secondary football-like hierarchical structures. Neutron power diffraction and refinement results demonstrate that the incorporation of Mg2+ into intrinsic vacancies can enlarge the space for Na-ion diffusion, which can increase the d-spacing of the (0 0 2) peak and the size of slabs but reduce the chemical bond length to result in an enhanced rate capability and cycling stability. The incorporation of Mg2+ into available vacancies and a unique morphology make Na0.7 Mg0.05 Mn0.8 Ni0.1 Co0.1 O2 a promising cathode, which can be charged and discharged at an ultra-high current density of 2000 mA g-1 with an excellent specific capacity of 60 mAh g-1 .

        "abstract": "O3-type layered oxide cathodes are promising for practical sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high theoretical capacity, facile synthesis, and sufficient Na+ storage. However, they face challenges such as rapid capacity loss and poor cycling stability, mainly attributed to irreversible phase transitions. To address these challenges, a novel cathode material, Li/Sn co-substituted O3-Na0.95Li0.07Sn0.01Ni0.22Fe0.2Mn0.5O2 (LSNFM), has been designed by regulating the electronic structure, in which Li+ activates more redox reactions of Ni2+/3+ and Fe3+/4+ above 2.5 V and suppresses the redox reactivity of Mn3+/4+ below 2.5 V, while Sn4+ can prevent the charge delocalization in the transition metal layer, contributing to structural stability. Due to this synergistic effect, the as-prepared LSNFM electrode with high structural reversibility displays a 27.2% capacity increase contributed by the high-voltage transition metal ion redox activity and exhibits excellent long-term cycling stability, an 84.0% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 1 C and an 84.7% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 5 C. The fundamental mechanism is fully investigated using systematic in situ/ex situ characterization techniques and density functional theory computations.

A first-principles method has been used to calculate the Bader charge transfer, the electronic structures and the magnetic moments during the entire delithiation or desodiation process. The Bader charge analysis suggests that all the S, O and Cr ions in LiCrX2 and NaCrX2 participate in the redox reactions, where the loss of electrons of S ions is clearly larger than that of O ions. Besides, the redox processes of Cr ions are of much less significance. It is noted that, in the sulfides, Cr ions even gain a small portion of electrons rather than losing electrons during the extraction of Li/Na ions. All the charge transfer happens between the S-3p/O-2p and the Cr-3d bands. The redox reactions of O or S ions originate from the energy levels of O/S being pushed towards/across the Fermi surface due to the strong p–d hybridization.",

        "abstract": "Recently, all‐solid‐state sodium batteries (Na‐ASSBs) have received increased interest owing to their high safety and potential of high energy density. The potential of Na‐ASSBs based on sodium superionic conductor (NASICON)‐structured Na3V2(PO4)3(Na3VP) cathodes have been proven by their high capacity and a long cycling stability closely related to the microstructural evolution. However, the detailed kinetics of the electrochemical processes in the cathodes is still unclear. In this work, the sodiation/desodiation process of Na3VP is first investigated using in situ high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The intermediate Na2V2(PO4)3 (Na2VP) phase with the P21/c space group, which would be inhibited by constant electron beam irradiation, is observed at the atomic scale. With the calculated volume change and the electrode–electrolyte interface after cycling, it can be concluded that the Na2VP phase reduces the lattice mismatch between Na3VP and NaV2(PO4)3 (NaVP), preventing structural collapse. Based on the density functional theory calculation (DFT), the Na+ ion migrates more rapidly in the Na2VP structure, which facilitates the desodiation and sodiation processes. The formation of Na2VP phase lowers the formation energy of NaVP. This study demonstrates the dynamic evolution of the Na3VP structure, paving the way for an in‐depth understanding of electrode materials for energy‐storage applications.",

        "abstract": "Sodium dendrite growth is responsible for short circuiting and fire hazard of metal batteries, which limits the potential application of sodium metal anode. Sodium dendrite can be effectively suppressed by applying mechanically robust electrolyte in battery systems. Herein, a composite gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) is designed and fabricated, mainly consisting of graphene oxide (GO) and polyvinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP). With the addition of an appropriate amount of GO content, the compressive Young's modulus of 2 wt% GO+PVDF-HFP (2-GPH) composite GPE is greatly enhanced by a factor of 10, reaching 2.5 GPa, which is crucial in the suppression of sodium dendrite growth. As a result, uniform sodium deposition and ultralong reversible sodium plating/stripping (over 400 h) at high current density (5 mA cm-2 ) are achieved. Furthermore, as evidenced by molecular dynamics simulation, the GO content facilitates the sodium ion transportation, giving a high ionic conductivity of 2.3 × 10-3 S cm-1 . When coupled with Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 cathode in a full sodium metal battery, a high initial capacity of 107 mA h g-1 at 1 C (1 C = 117 mA g-1 ) is recorded, with an excellent capacity retention rate of 93.5% and high coulombic efficiency of 99.8% after 1100 cycles.",

        "abstract": "The ether-based electrolytes show excellent performance on anodes in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), but they still show poor compatibility with the cathodes. Here, ether electrolytes with NaBF4 as the main salt or additive were applied in NFM//HC full cells and showed enhanced performance than the electrolyte with NaPF6. Then, BF4- was found to have a stronger interaction with Na+, which could reduce the solvation of Na+ with the solvent, thus inducing the formation of the cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) and solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layers rich in inorganic species. Moreover, the morphology, structure, composition, and solubility of CEI and SEI were explored, concluding that NaBF4 could induce more stable CEI and SEI layers rich in B-containing species and inorganics. This work proposes using NaBF4 as the main salt or additive to improve the performance of ether electrolytes in NFM//HC full cells, which provides a strategy to improve the compatibility of ether-based electrolytes and cathodes.",

        "abstract": "Electrodes for solid-state batteries require the conduction of both ions and electrons for extraction of the energy from the active material. In this study, we apply cold sintering to a model composite cathode system to study how low-temperature densification enables a degree of control over the mixed conducting properties of such systems. The model system contains the NASICON-structured Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) active material, NASICON-structured solid electrolyte (Na3Zr2Si2PO12, NZSP), and electron-conducting carbon nanofiber (CNF). Pellets of varying weight fractions of components were cold-sintered to greater than 90% of the theoretical density at 350-375 °C, a 360 MPa uniaxial pressure, and with a 3 h dwell time using sodium hydroxide as the transient sintering aid. The bulk conductivity of the diphasic composites was measured with impedance spectroscopy; the total conductivities of the composites are increased from 3.8 × 10-8 S·cm-1 (pure NVP) to 5.81 × 10-6 S·cm-1 (60 wt % NZSP) and 1.31 × 10-5 S·cm-1 (5 wt % CNF). Complimentary direct current polarization experiments demonstrate a rational modulation in transference number (τ) of the composites; τ of pure NVP = 0.966, 60 wt % NZSP = 0.995, and 5 wt % CNF = 0.116. Finally, all three materials are combined into triphasic composites to serve as solid-state cathodes in a half-cell configuration with a liquid electrolyte.

However, to compete with mature energy storage technologies such as lithium ion batteries, further progress is needed, particularly regarding the energy density and operational lifetime. Considering these aspects as well as a circular economy perspective, the authors use biodegradable cellulose nanoparticles for the preparation of a gel polymer electrolyte that offers a high liquid electrolyte uptake of 2985%, an ionic conductivity of 2.32 mS cm-1 , and a Na+ transference number of 0.637. A balanced ratio of mechanically rigid cellulose nanocrystals and flexible cellulose nanofibers results in a mesoporous hierarchical structure that ensures close contact with metallic Na. This architecture offers stable Na plating/stripping at current densities up to ±500 µA cm-2 , outperforming conventional fossil-based NIBs containing separator-liquid electrolytes. Paired with an environmentally sustainable and economically attractive Na2 Fe2 (SO4 )3 cathode, the battery reaches an energy density of 240 Wh kg-1 , delivering 69.7 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles at a rate of 1C. In comparison, Celgard in liquid electrolyte delivers only 0.6 mAh g-1 at C/4.

Combining the cation-solvent co-intercalation and anion storage chemistry, such a SDIB operated with ether-based electrolyte can intrinsically eliminate the sluggish desolvation process. Hence, it can exhibit an extremely fast kinetics of 10 A g -1 (corresponding to 100C-rate) with a high capacity retention of 45%. Moreover, the desolvation-free mechanism endows the battery with 61% of its room-temperature capacity at an ultra-low temperature of -70°C.

In this work, we synthesize ultra-small SnS quantum dots (QDs) anchored onto nitrogen-enriched carbon (NC) nanospheres through facile hydrothermal and carbonization processes to prepare a progressive anode material for sodium-ion batteries. The optimized SnS QDs@NC electrode delivered an initial discharge capacity of 281 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 and exhibited excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 75% after 500 cycles at high current density of 1,000 mA g-1. Ex-situ XRD, XPS, FE-SEM, TEM measurements and kinetic study were performed to unveil the sodium storage mechanism of the SnS QDs@NC electrode. A sodium-ion full cell assembled with SnS QDs@NC anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode exhibited high capacity and good cycling stability. Such a superior electrochemical performance of SnS QDs@NC can be attributed to the synergistic effects of NC and SnS QDs, where NC serves as a conducting matrix to support SnS QDs and helps avoid structural degradation.

Here, the reversibility of potassium halides, lithium halides, sodium halides, and zinc halides is achieved through decreasing their dimensionality by the strong π-cation interactions between metal cations and reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Especially, the energy densities of KI-, KBr-, and KCl-based materials are 722.2, 635.0, and 739.4 Wh kg-1 , respectively, which are higher than those of other cathode materials for potassium-ion batteries.

However, the low cycle efficiency and poor rate capacity of cathode materials have hindered the commercialization of SIBs, prompting extensive research efforts to address these challenges. Ion doping into the material structure is considered to be an effective, simple, and scalable approach to enhancing the electrical performance of cathode materials. In this work, B and F elemental ions were selectively doped into the structure of sodium-lithium-manganese-cobalt oxide material via the sol–gel method combined with calcination. The effects of B and F ion doping on the properties of the obtained materials exhibited distinct variations, particularly in the electrochemical performance. While the B-doped material (B-NLMC) exhibited a specific capacity of up to 166.5 mAh g–1 at a current density of 10 mA g–1 and maintained 72.1% capacity after 100 cycles, the material simultaneously doped with B and F ions (BF-NLMC) demonstrated lower specific capacity and cycling efficiency compared to B-NLMC. However, the BF-NLMC material exhibited significantly improved rate capability, delivering a specific capacity of up to approximately 80 mAh g–1 at a high current density of 200 mA g–1.

However, the O 2p non‐bonding state can only undergo redox at high voltages and is often accompanied by severe structural distortion. In this study, the whole‐voltage‐range anionic redox has successfully been achieved in Metal‐organic frameworks (MOF) derived chemically homogeneous P2‐Na0.67Ni0.2Mg0.2Mn0.6O2 (NNMMO). Through a systematic analysis of the orbital combinations of TMs and O, it is found that the Mg‐induced O 2p non‐bonding state as an electron donor, forming strong π‐type interactions between Ni 3d spin‐down t2g orbitals. The resulting π‐configurational oxygen occupies an anti‐bonding state just below the Fermi level, exhibiting high oxidation activity and stability. Additionally, the high covalency between Mn and O increases the strength of the Mn–O bond, mitigating the structural aberration of NNMMO. As a result, NNMMO demonstrates a high capacity of 216 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and stable battery performance, with a capacity retention of ≈90% after 500 cycles at 2 C.

        "abstract": "Metal oxalate has become a most promising anode candidate material for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries. However, there exists the problem of capacity decrease due to the volume expansion of the active material during cycling. Herein, the rodlike CoC2O4·2H2O/rGO hybrid has been fabricated via a novel multi-step solvo/hydro-thermal strategy. The structure characteristic of microrod CoC2O4·2H2O wrapped using rGO sheet not only inhibits the volume variation of the hybrid electrode during the cycle, but also accelerates the transfer of electrons and ions amongst the 3D graphene network, thereby improving the electrochemical properties of CoC2O4·2H2O. The CoC2O4·2H2O/rGO electrode delivers specific capacity of 1011.5 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 200 cycles for lithium storage, and exhibits high capacity of 221.1 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 100 cycles for sodium storage. Moreover, the full cell CoC2O4·2H2O/rGO//LiCoO2 consisted of the CoC2O4·2H2O/rGO anode and LiCoO2 cathode maintains 138.1 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at 0.2 A g-1 and has superior long-cycle stability. In addition, in-situ Raman, in-situ and ex-situ X-ray diffraction techniques have provided a unique opportunity to fully understand the reaction mechanism of CoC2O4·2H2O/rGO. This work also supplies a new perspective and certain research basis for the application of metal oxalate materials in high performance lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries.",

        "title": "Coupled Carbonization Strategy toward Advanced Hard Carbon for High-Energy Sodium-Ion Battery.",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are expected to be a promising commercial alternative to lithium-ion batteries for grid electricity storage due to their potential low cost in the near future. Up to the present, the anode material still remains a great challenge for the application of SIBs, especially at room temperature. Graphite has an obvious limitation to store larger radius sodium ions (Na+) in comparison with lithium ions (Li+), while the hard carbon with large interlayer distance can demonstrate a relatively high storage capability and durable cycle life. However, the disadvantages of low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) mainly caused by large surface area and high cost synthetic approach hinder its practical applications. Herein, a new coupled carbonization strategy is presented to prepare a cost-effective hard carbon material by pyrolyzing and carbonizing the mixture of abundant sucrose and phenolic resin. Benefiting from the specialized pyrolysis reaction process and optimized conditions as studied in detail, the hard carbon has an extremely low surface area of 1.54 m2 g-1 and high initial Coulombic efficiency of 87%, which have been rarely reported before and enhance the utilization efficiency of Na+ consumption within the cathode in the future. More importantly, the hard carbon, with a high interlayer distance 3.95 Å, can deliver a higher capacity of 319 mAh g-1 and maintain a finer capacity retention of 90% over 150 cycles. Besides, a full cell with the configuration of as-prepared hard carbon anode versus an air-stable O3-Na0.9[Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48]O2 cathode is further presented, and it has a high ICE of 80% and energy density of 256 Wh kganode-1 (vs hard carbon) with reliable cycle performance. The results demonstrate that our synthetic strategy is feasible and extendable, while the tunable carbon-based materials should have wider applications in addition to the attractive properties in Na-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The peak-loading shift function of sodium-ion batteries in large-grid energy store station poses a giant challenge on the account of poor rate performance of cathodes. NASICON type Na3V2(PO4)3 with a stable three-dimensional framework and fast ion diffusion channels has been regarded as one of the potential candidates and extensively studied. Nevertheless, a multilevel integrated tactic to boost the performance of Na3V2(PO4)3 in terms of crystal structure modulation, coated carbon graphitization regulation, and particle morphology design is rarely reported and deserves much attention. In this study, organic ferric was used to prepare Fe-doped Na3V2(PO4)3@C cathode on the account of low cost, environmental friendliness, and catalytic function of Fe on carbon graphitization. The density functional theory calculation depicts that the most stable site for Fe atom is the V site and moderate replacement of Fe at V position would reduce the band gap energy from 2.19 by 0.43 eV and improve the electron transfer, which is crucial for the intrinsic poor conductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3. The experimental results show that Fe element can be introduced into the bulk structure successfully, modulating relevant structural parameters. In addition, the coated carbon layer graphitization degree is also regulated due to the catalysis function of Fe. And, the decomposition of organic ferric would infuse the formation of porous structure, which can promote electrolyte permeation and shorten the electron/ion diffusion. Finally, the optimized Na3V1.85Fe0.15(PO4)3@C could possess a high capacity of 103.69 mA h g-1 and retain 91.45% after 1200 cycles at 1.0C as well as 94.45 mA h g-1 at 20C. In addition, the excellent performance is comprehensively elucidated via ex situ X-ray diffraction and pseudocapacitance characterization. The multifunction contribution of Fe-doping may provide new clue for designing porous electrode materials and a new sight into Fe-doped carbon-coated material.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) hold tremendous potential in next‐generation energy storage. However, no SIB has yet achieved simultaneous support for high voltage, rapid charging, and all‐climate adaptability due to electrolyte limitations. This study successfully constructs versatile SIBs using an optimized acetonitrile (AN)‐based electrolyte, which offers excellent high‐voltage tolerance, high ionic conductivity, anion‐enriched solvation structure, and a wide liquidus temperature range. The engineered solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) exhibits low resistance and exceptional stability, effectively supporting fast charging, temperature‐adaptive operation, and long‐term cycling stability. Consequently, this tailored electrolyte, combined with a robust SEI, enables hard carbon (HC) anodes to achieve a high reversible capacity of 223 mAh g−1 at a fast rate of 5 C. When paired with a high‐voltage NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) cathode, the HC||NFM full cells operate stably at a high cut‐off voltage of 4.15 V, sustaining over 1400 cycles at 5 C. Furthermore, a practical 3 Ah pouch cell demonstrates excellent stability, retaining 90.7% of its capacity after 1000 cycles, and shows all‐climate adaptability, maintaining 56.4% of its room‐temperature capacity at −60 °C and 97.3% retention after 350 cycles at 50 °C.

        "title": "Exploring Oxygen Activity in the High Energy P2-Type Na0.78Ni0.23Mn0.69O2 Cathode Material for Na-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Large-scale electric energy storage is fundamental to the use of renewable energy. Recently, research and development efforts on room-temperature sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) have been revitalized, as NIBs are considered promising, low-cost alternatives to the current Li-ion battery technology for large-scale applications. Herein, we introduce a novel layered oxide cathode material, Na0.78Ni0.23Mn0.69O2. This new compound provides a high reversible capacity of 138 mAh g-1 and an average potential of 3.25 V vs Na+/Na with a single smooth voltage profile. Its remarkable rate and cycling performances are attributed to the elimination of the P2-O2 phase transition upon cycling to 4.5 V. The first charge process yields an abnormally excess capacity, which has yet to be observed in other P2 layered oxides. Metal K-edge XANES results show that the major charge compensation at the metal site during Na-ion deintercalation is achieved via the oxidation of nickel (Ni2+) ions, whereas, to a large extent, manganese (Mn) ions remain in their Mn4+ state. Interestingly, electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS) results reveal differences in electronic structures in the bulk and at the surface of electrochemically cycled particles. At the surface, transition metal ions (TM ions) are in a lower valence state than in the bulk, and the O K-edge prepeak disappears. On the basis of previous reports on related Li-excess LIB cathodes, it is proposed that part of the charge compensation mechanism during the first cycle takes place at the lattice oxygen site, resulting in a surface to bulk transition metal gradient. We believe that by optimizing and controlling oxygen activity, Na layered oxide materials with higher capacities can be designed.",

Recently, eminent researchers have criticised the implementation of e.g. low active material contents/electrode loadings, the use of research‐type battery cell constructions, or the lack of statistically relevant data, resulting in overstated data and thus giving misleading predictions of the key performance indicators of new battery technologies. Here, we report on the establishment of a reference system for the development of sodium‐ion batteries. Electrodes are fabricated under relevant conditions using 9.5 mg/cm² self‐synthesised Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode active material and 3.6 mg/cm² commercially available hard carbon anode active material. It is found that different types of battery cells are more or less suitable for half‐ and/ or full‐cell testing, resulting in ir/reproducible or underestimated active material capacities. Furthermore, the influence of electrode overhang, which is relevant for upscaling, is evaluated. The demonstrator cell (TRL 4‐5) has been further characterised providing measured data on the power/energy density and thermal behaviour during rate testing up to 15 C and projections are made for its practical limits.",

The single‐layered MoS2 is confined in the carbon matrix. The mesopores between the composite nanorods provide fast electrolyte diffusion. The obtained nanocomposite shows a high sodium‐storage capability, excellent rate capacity, and very good cycling performance. A capacity of 310 mAh g−1 can remain at 5.0 A g−1 after 2500 cycles. Furthermore, a sodium‐ion battery (SIB) full cell composed of the MoS2/carbon composite anode and a Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode maintains a specific capacity of 330 mAh g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 during 100 cycles.

        "abstract": "An intriguing mechanism for enabling fast Na kinetics during oxygen redox (OR) is proposed to produce high‐power‐density cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) based on the P2‐type oxide models, Na2/3[Mn6/9Ni3/9]O2 (NMNO) and Na2/3[Ti1/9Mn5/9Ni3/9]O2 (NTMNO) using the “potential pillar” effect. The critical structural parameter of NTMNO lowers the Na migration barrier in the desodiated state because the electrostatic repulsion of O(2p)O(2p) that occurs between transition metal layers is combined with the chemically stiff Ti4+(3d)O(2p) bond to locally retain the strong repulsion effect. The NTMNO interlayer distance moderately decreases upon charging with oxygen oxidation, whereas that of NMNO decreases at a much faster rate, which can be explained by the dependence of OR activity on the coordination environment. Fundamental electrochemical experiments clearly indicate that the Ti doping of the bare material significantly improves its rate capability during OR, and detailed electrochemical and structural analyses show much faster Na kinetics for NTMNO than for NMNO. A systematic comparison of the two cathode oxides based on experiments and first‐principles calculations establishes the “potential pillar” concept of not only improving the sluggish Na kinetics upon OR reaction but also harnessing the full potential of the anionic redox for high‐power‐density SIBs.",

However, its practical application is limited by its poor electronic conductivity. In this study, we aim to solve this problem through the in situ growth of NaMnHCF on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using a simple coprecipitation method. The results show that the overall electronic conductivity of NaMnHCF is significantly improved after the introduction of CNTs. The NaMnHCF@10%CNT sample presents a specific capacity of 90 mA h g−1, even at a current density of 20 C (2400 mA g−1). The study shows that the optimized composite exhibits a superior electrochemical performance at different mass loadings (from low to high), which is attributed to the enhanced electron transport and shortened electron pathway. Surprisingly, the cycling performance of the composites was also improved, resulting from decreased polarization and the subsequent reduction in the side reactions at the cathode/electrolyte interface. Furthermore, we revealed the evolution of potential plateau roots from the extraction of crystal water during the charge–discharge process of NaMnHCF based on the experimental results. This study is instructive not only for the practical application of NaMnHCF materials but also for advancing our scientific understanding of the behavior of crystal water during the charge–discharge process.",

Hence, enabling charge compensation in sodium layered oxides is a fascinating task for extending the cycle life of sodium‐ion batteries. Herein a Ti/Mg co‐doping strategy for a model P2‐Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 cathode material is put forward to activate charge compensation through highly hybridized O2pTM3d covalent bonds. In this way, the interlayer OO electrostatic repulsion is weakened upon deeply charging, which strongly affects the systematic total energy that transforms the striking P2–O2 interlayer contraction into a moderate solid‐solution‐type evolution. Accordingly, the cycling stability of the codoped cathode material is improved superiorly over the pristine sample. This study starts a perspective way of optimizing the sodium layered cathodes by rational structural design coupling electrochemical reactions, which can be extended to widespread battery researches.",

        "abstract": "The sol–gel method is used to synthesize a new compound called Na3Fe0.8V1.2(PO4)3/C (NFVP/C), which has a crystal structure and belongs to the NASICON-type family. The dimensions of NFVP's unit cell are a = 8.717 (1) Å, c = 21.84 (1) Å, and V = 1437.27 (0) Å3. The Na‖NFVP/C battery provides a discharge potential of 3.43 V compared to Na+/Na, an intriguing rate capability of 76.2 mA h g−1 at 40C, and maintains an impressive capacity of 97.8% after 500 cycles at 5C. The excellent efficiency of Na3Fe0.8V1.2(PO4)3/C can be ascribed to its elevated Na+ conductivity and reduced energy barrier for sodium-ion diffusion. The NASICON-type Na3Fe0.8V1.2(PO4)3/C is a promising material for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Polyanionic material, specifically the NASICON-type material, is considered a promising cathode material for Na-ion batteries (SIBs) because of its stable structure and high operating voltage. Further, it improves the energy density correlated with the well utilization of all Na in the compound. For Na3V2(PO4)2F3(NVPF), the extraction of the third Na, reported as the electrochemical inactivated, can be realized at a high voltage region while forming an irreversible tetragonal phase. In this study, we introduce Ti doping to the Na2VTi(PO4)2F3(NVTPF) material; we reveal that the Ti-doped NVTPF could effectively suppress the irreversible phase transformation, thus successfully harnessing Na in a wide voltage range. Experimental study discloses that the Ti-substituted Na2VTi(PO4)2F3 could take up the Na+ from Amam phase to Cmc21 phase between 1.0 V and 4.8 V reversibly accounting for the 2 Na+ transportation that shows favorable Na+ kinetics and structural stability. Our research provides the strategy to stabilize the polyanion structure upon charging at a high voltage range and inspires the utilization of full sodium in the polyanionic materials, which could be considered as a material design for future conventional applications.",

        "abstract": "Polyanion-type phosphate materials with Na-super-ionic conductor structures are promising for next-generation sodium-ion battery cathodes, although the intrinsically low electroconductivity and limited energy density have restricted their practical applications. In this study, we put forward substituting an inert phosphate with a redox-active silicate to improve the energy density and intrinsic electroconductivity of polyanion-type phosphate materials, thus enabling an advance in sodium-ion battery cathodes. As a proof of concept, some of the phosphate of Na3V2(PO4)3 was replaced by silicate to fabricate Na3V2(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1, which exhibited a higher average discharge voltage of 3.36 V and a higher capacity of 115.8 mA h g-1 than pristine Na3V2(PO4)3 (3.31 V, 109.6 mA h g-1) at 0.5 C, therefore improving the energy density. Moreover, the introduced silicate enhanced the intrinsic electroconductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3 materials, as confirmed by both theoretical simulation and electrochemical measurements. After pairing with a commercial hard carbon anode, the optimized Na3V2(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1 cathode enabled a stable-cycling full cell with 90.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 5 C and a remarkable average coulombic efficiency of 99.88%.",

        "abstract": "The rapid growth of the global battery demand has accelerated the search for efficient low-cost and sustainable batteries. Among them, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) represent one of the most promising electrochemical energy storage systems for stationary and light vehicle applications. The growing interest in SIBs has been catalyzed by the adoption of this battery technology by several companies worldwide.\n Despite the great achievements recently announced, several challenges persist. Among them, is the limited energy density of SIBs especially when compared to lithium-ion batteries. To tackle the challenges, research has been focused on the rational design of more powerful sodium-ion battery materials. While hard carbon seems to be the anode of choice, several cathode chemistries have been proposed so far. Out of all, polyanionic compounds have garnered widespread attention as promising reversible cathode materials given their rich chemistry, ability to tolerate volumetric stress upon cycling, and high operating potential. Lattice doping with three fluoride ions onto NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)3 material yields the formation of a fluorophosphate Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) with enhanced theoretical capacity and operating potential of 128 mAh g-1 and 3.95V vs. Na+/Na respectively. Nevertheless, performance-limiting traits such as inferior electronic conductivity and the restricted reversible capacity obstruct the overall practical application for high energy density SIB.\n To address the listed challenges, we have examined the synergistic role of structural modulation and surface modification strategies through the synthesis of boron-doped carbon-coated hollow microsphere Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) materials deploying solvothermal, chemical vapor deposition with a subsequent solution-mixing technique. The prepared materials were analyzed via physical-chemical characterizations to elucidate the phase identification, crystal structure, surface morphology, optimal coating thickness, and prevailing oxidation states. Further, the electrochemical activity of the as-prepared materials was demonstrated in half-cell configuration using rate capability and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) cycling within a potential window of 2.5V- 4.3V.\n In this work, we discuss the comparison between a pristine version of the NVPF (S1) material with two carbon-coated materials, namely a 10 wt% boron-doped carbon-coated NVPF (S2) and 20 wt% boron-doped carbon-coated NVPF (S3). It is found that the optimal conditions for improved rate performance and cyclability are identified for the composite NVPF (S2) material with capacity retention of 97% after 300 cycles when compared to NVPF (S1) and coated NVPF (S3) which displayed capacity holding of 64% and 94%. Further, an in-depth analysis through impedance spectroscopy and post-mortem characterization has been carried out to shed light on the effect of the boron-doped carbon coating on interfacial and structural stability upon cycling.",

        "abstract": "Two‐dimensional porous carbon nanosheets (PCNSs) are considered promising anodes for lithium‐ion batteries due to their synergetic features arising from both graphene and porous structures. Herein, using naturally abundant and biocompatible sodium humate (SH) as the precursor, PCNSs are prepared from the laboratory scale up to the kilogram scale by a method of a facile ice‐templating‐induced puzzle coupled with a carbonization strategy. Such obtained SH‐derived PCNSs (SH‐PCNSs) possess a hierarchical porous structure dominated by mesopores having a specific surface area (~127.19 2 g−1), pore volume (~0.134 cm3 g−1), sheet‐like morphology (~2.18 nm in thickness), and nitrogen/oxygen‐containing functional groups. Owing to these merits, the SH‐PCNSs present impressive Li‐ion storage characteristics, including high reversible capacity (1011 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1), excellent rate capability (465 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1), and superior cycle stability (76.8% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles at 5 A g−1). It is noted that the SH‐PCNSs prepared from the kilogram‐scale production procedure possess comparable electrochemical properties. Furthermore, coupling with a LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode, the full cells deliver a high capacity of 167 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 and exhibit an outstanding energy density of 128.8 Wh kg−1, highlighting the practicability of this porous carbon nanosheets and the potential commercial opportunity of the scalable processing approach.",

Here, by employing double-network hydrogel electrolytes formed by poly(vinyl alcohol) and alginate, the content and activity of water molecules at the electrode-electrolyte interface are reduced, and the mechanical stability of the electrode is reinforced, thereby affording reliable protection to the cathode bonded with SA.

        "abstract": "Flexible electrode design with robust structure and good performance is one of the priorities for flexible batteries to power emerging wearable electronics, and organic cathode materials have become contenders for flexible self‐supporting electrodes. However, issues such as easy electrolyte solubility and low intrinsic conductivity contribute to high polarization and rapid capacity decay. Herein, we have designed a flexible self‐supporting cathode based on perylene‐3,4,9,10‐tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), interfacial engineering enhanced by polypyrrole (PPy), and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), forming the interconnected and flexible PTCDA/PPy/CNTs using polymerization reaction and vacuum filtration methods, effectively curbing those challenges. When used as the cathode of sodium‐ion batteries, PTCDA/PPy/CNTs exhibit excellent rate capability (105.7 mAh g−1 at 20 C), outstanding cycling stability (79.4% capacity retention at 5 C after 500 cycles), and remarkable wide temperature application capability (86.5 mAh g−1 at −30°C and 115.4 mAh g−1 at 60°C). The sodium storage mechanism was verified to be a reversible oxidation reaction between two Na+ ions and carbonyl groups by density functional theory calculations, in situ infrared Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and in situ Raman spectroscopy. Surprisingly, the pouch cells based on PTCDA/PPy/CNTs exhibit good mechanical flexibility in various mechanical states.

Importantly, we identify a hierarchical thermal transport mechanism in NaVO3 and the significant contribution of diffusive thermal transport. With the combined two channels, we reveal that NaVO3 has the anisotropic and ultralow thermal conductivity κ, which is derived from the bonding heterogeneity with the coexistence of strong V-O bonds and weak Na-O bonds, implying the possibility of engineering the κ of SIBs by spatially tuning the sodium concentration distribution.

        "abstract": "This study evaluates the effect of equimolar substitution of manganese by cobalt or nickel in hexacyanoferrate (HCF) open frameworks as electrode materials for Na-ion batteries. As the stability of Mn-N bonds is crucial to obtain long term stability and cyclability of manganese (Mn-HCF), the samples were analyzed thoroughly using several spectroscopic and structural methods. The XPS and infrared experiments reveal that the charge density around Fe is modulated by the presence of Co or Ni, which is associated with their high polarizing power, leading to decreased cell distortion as revealed by XRD. The Rietveld refinement demonstrated that the octahedra built by 3d metals and the cyanide nitrogen were distorted with the axial bond distances being larger than the equatorial distances. This octahedral distortion promotes the spin behavior of 3/2 for Mn2+ confirmed by magnetic experiments; the arising of this spin state is attributed to d orbital splitting determined by UV-Vis experiments. Therefore, the changes upon Mn substitution are related to the modification of the covalent character of Mn-N bonds, modulated by the effect of the Ni and Co polarizing power. All these properties improve the electrochemical stability of the Ni or Co substituted materials as Na-ion batteries, leading to higher capacity retention even at higher C-rates (5C) and good capacity recovery, in comparison with those obtained for Mn-HCF.",

However, they still suffer from not only fast capacity fading but also poor rate capability. Herein, we introduce P2-Na0.75[Li0.15Ni0.15Mn0.7]O2, an oxygen-redox-based layered oxide cathode material for SIBs. The effect of Ni doping on the electrochemical performance was investigated by comparison with Ni-free P2-Na0.67[Li0.22Mn0.78]O2. The Na0.75[Li0.15Ni0.15Mn0.7]O2 delivered a specific capacity of ~160 mAh g-1 in the voltage region of 1.5–4.6 V at 0.1C in Na cells. Combined experiments (galvanostatic cycling, neutron powder diffraction (NPD), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (7Li NMR)) and theoretical studies (density functional theory, DFT calculations) confirmed that Ni substitution not only increases the operating voltage and decreases voltage hysteresis but also improves the cycling stability by reducing Li migration from transition metal (TM) to Na layers. This research demonstrates the effect of Li and Ni co-doping in P2-type layered materials and suggests a new strategy of using Mn-rich cathode materials via oxygen redox with optimization of doping elements for SIBs.",

The nanopore structure of substrate materials is demonstrated to play a vital role in stabilizing Se cathodes and approaching superior Na-ion storage properties. Herein, an ideal nanorod-like trimodal hierarchical porous carbon (THPC) host is fabricated through a facile one-step carbonization method for advanced Na–Se batteries. The THPC possesses a trimodal nanopore structure encompassing micropores, mesopores, and macropores, and functions as a good accommodator of Se molecules, a reservoir of polyselenide intermediates, a buffer for volume expansion of Se species during sodiation, and a promoter for electron/ion transfer in the electrochemical process. As a result, Na–Se batteries assembled with the Se–THPC composite cathode realize high utilization of Se, fast redox kinetics, and excellent cyclability. Furthermore, the Na-ion storage mechanism of the well-designed Se–THPC composite is profoundly revealed by in situ visual characterization techniques.",

        "abstract": "Cobalt diselenide (CoSe2) has drawn great concern as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries due to its considerable theoretical capacity. Nevertheless, the poor cycling stability and rate performance still impede its practical implantation. Here, CoSe2/nitrogen-doped carbon-skeleton hybrid microcubes with a TiO2 layer (denoted as TNC-CoSe2) are favorably prepared via a facile template-engaged strategy, in which a TiO2-coated Prussian blue analogue of Co3[Co(CN)6]2 is used as a new precursor accompanied with a selenization procedure. Such structures can concurrently boost ion and electron diffusion kinetics and inhibit the structural degradation during cycling through the close contact between the TiO2 layer and NC-CoSe2. Besides, this hybrid structure promotes the superior Na-ion intercalation pseudocapacitance due to the well-designed interfaces. The as-prepared TNC-CoSe2 microcubes exhibit a superior cycling capability (511 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 200 cycles) and long cycling life (456 mA h g-1 at 6.4 A g-1 for 6000 cycles with a retention of 92.7%). Coupled with a sodium vanadium fluorophosphate (Na3V2(PO4)2F3)@C cathode, this assembled full cell displays a specific capacity of 281 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 for 100 cycles.

        "abstract": "This study examines and compares the impact of various interfacial modification strategies in optimizing the contact resistance between the rigid ceramic electrolyte and cathode active material (AM) in solid‐state sodium‐ion batteries (SSBs). All the cells are fabricated using Na3.1V2P2.9Si0.1O12, Na3.456Mg0.128Zr1.872Si2.2P0.8O12, and Na as a cathode AM, solid electrolyte (SE) and anode, respectively. The AM/SE interface is modified by (1) wetting the interface with organic liquid electrolyte (LE), (2) slurry casting and sintering a thin layer of composite cathode, and (3) infiltrating AM precursors inside the porous SE structure followed by drying and sintering. Despite exhibiting a stable cyclability performance, the SSBs prepared using the LE modification and composite cathode approach possess a low AM loading of < 1 mg·cm−2. On the other hand, the SSBs with infiltrated‐cathode exhibit a superior discharge capacity of ∼ 102 mAh·g−1 at 0.2C and less than 5% capacity fading after 50 cycles at room temperature. Notably, these cells contain a high AM loading of 2.12 mg·cm−2. The microstructural analysis reveals the presence of AM particles inside the pores of the porous SE, allowing for the efficient insertion/removal of sodium ions. The porous scaffold of SE not only provides continuous sodium‐ion conduction pathways inside the cathode structure but also renders stability by accommodating stress induced by volume change during repeated cycling. The outcomes of this work demonstrate the effectiveness of the wet‐chemical infiltration technique in improving the AM loading and storage capacity performance of SSBs working at 25°C.",

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) based on the multielectron reactions between V2+ and V5+ has been considered a promising cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, it still suffers from unsatisfactory stability, caused by the poor reversibility of the V5+/V4+ redox couple and structure evolution. Herein, we propos a strategy that combines high-entropy substitution and electrolyte optimization to boost the reversible multielectron reactions of NVP. The high reversibility of the V5+/V4+ redox couple and crystalline structure evolution are disclosed by in situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectra and in situ X-ray diffraction. Meanwhile, the electrochemical reaction kinetics of high-entropy substitution NVP (HE-NVP) can be further improved in the diglyme-based electrolyte. These enable HE-NVP to deliver a superior electrochemical performance (capacity retention of 93.1% after 2000 cycles; a large reversible capacity of 120 mAh g-1 even at 5.0 A g-1). Besides, the long cycle life and high power density of the HE-NVP∥natural graphite full-cell configuration demonstrated the superiority of HE-NVP cathode in SIBs. This work highlights that the synergism of high-entropy substitution and electrolyte optimization is a powerful strategy to enhance the sodium-storage performance of polyanionic cathodes for SIBs.",

It is also found that a light change on the local electronic and structural states or phase change could be observed after the first cycle, resulting in the fast capacity fade at room temperature.

Here, the practicability of solid‐state electrochemical (SSE) pre‐sodiation technique for hard carbon anode is assessed to conquer such challenges. The uniformly pre‐sodiated HC (Pre‐HC) can be fabricated through the SSE reaction between the HC and preloaded sodium metal film without introducing a liquid electrolyte. After being immerged in the electrolyte, a thin artificial SEI with abundant inorganic species is formed on the surface of Pre‐HC due to the spontaneous chemical reaction, and the ICE of HC is improved from 76.0% to 107.9%. Full cell paired with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode exhibits a high ICE of 94.0% with 70% of energy density augment (from 126.5 to 214.4 Wh kg−1) after anode pre‐sodiation. Pre‐HC anode still retains the pre‐sodiation capacity of 671.1 mAh gNa−1 after being stored in the dry air for 2 h.

Orthorhombic Nb2O5 (T‐Nb2O5) has recently been recognized as a promising anode material for Na‐HSCs due to its typical pseudocapacitive feature, but it suffers from intrinsically low electrical conductivity. Reasonably high electrochemical performance of T‐Nb2O5‐based electrodes could merely be gained to date when sufficient carbon content was introduced. In addition, flexible Na‐HSC devices have scarcely been demonstrated by far. Herein, an in situ encapsulation strategy is devised to directly grow ultrathin graphene shells over T‐Nb2O5 nanowires (denoted as Gr‐Nb2O5 composites) by plasma‐enhanced chemical vapor deposition, targeting a highly conductive anode material for Na‐HSCs. The few‐layered graphene capsules with ample topological defects would enable facile electron and Na+ ion transport, guaranteeing rapid pseudocapacitive processes at the Nb2O5/electrolyte interface. The Na‐HSC full‐cell comprising a Gr‐Nb2O5 anode and an activated carbon cathode delivers high energy/power densities (112.9 Wh kg−1/80.1 W kg−1 and 62.2 Wh kg−1/5330 W kg−1), outperforming those of recently reported Na‐HSC counterparts.

        "abstract": "Li‐ion batteries (LIBs) that can operate under low temperature (LT) conditions are essential for applications in orbital missions, subsea areas, and electric vehicles. Unfortunately, severe capacity loss is witnessed due to tremendous kinetic barriers that emerge at LT. Herein, to surmount such kinetic limitations, a low dielectric environment is tamed throughout the bulk electrolyte, which efficaciously brought the Li+ desolvation energy down to 30.76 kJ mol−1. At the meantime, the adoption of sodium cations (Na+) is proposed as a hetero‐cation additive, and a Li‐Na hybrid and fluoride‐rich interphase is further identified via preferential reduction of Na+‐(solvent/anion) clusters, which is found to efficiently facilitate Li+ migration through the LiF/NaF grain boundaries.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries are a low-cost alternative to lithium-ion batteries in large-scale electric energy storage applications due to the natural-abundant sodium resources and similar working principle to LIBs during cycling [1]. Until now, many different cathodes for SIBs have been studied, including layered transition metal oxides (NaxTMO2, x<1), Prussian blue-type compounds, polyanionic and organic compounds [2]. Among them, NaxTMO2 has been extensively reported, due to its layered structure, easy synthesis, promising electrochemical properties, and feasibility for commercial production [3]. According to the occupation of Na ions and oxygen stacking, NaxTMO2 can be classified into P2 and O3 types, where P2 structure contasins trigonal prismatic sites of sodium ions and ABBA oxygen stacking sequence and O3 structure represents octahedral sites of sodium ions and ABCABC oxygen stacking sequence [4]. At low potentials (<2.0V), there is a phase transition P2-P2’ connected with the manganese redox activity and the Jahn-Teller distortion [5]. Compared with O3-type structure, P2-type NaxTMO2 provides higher specific capacity and better structural stability due to the lower diffusion barriers through Na-ion prismatic sites [6].\n Iron- and manganese-based layered oxides for sodium-ion batteries have attracted renewed interest due to their low cost and environmental friendliness. However, the phase change at high voltage and the Jahn-Teller effect lead to shortening cycle life and poor rate capability. We design a structure optimization of the Na2/3Mn1/2Fe1/2O2 cathode through a partial substitution of Fe3+ to explore the mechanism of redox activity of P2-type Mn/Fe-based layered cathodes. We present the investigation of the effect of simultaneous cationic substitution on the electrochemical performance and structural stability of P2-Na2/3Mn1/2Fe1/2O2. The obtained material exhibits a solid solution mechanism during desodiation/resodiation process and delivers an initial discharge capacity of 168 mA h g-1 at 0.1C and a capacity retention of 80% after 50 cycles. The modified P2 composition has stable cycle performance in the potential window from 1.5V to 4.5V. The main focus here is to understand the fundamental electrochemical mechanism of this layered cathode material by exploring the redox processes of transition metal cations and oxygen anions upon cycling. In situ X-ray synchrotron radiation diffraction is used to explore the structural changes during cycling. In situ X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy is used to elucidate the local electronic structure of Fe and Mn atoms as it evolves throughout this electrochemical process. 23Na solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is used to investigate Na coordination environments during desodiation/resodiation. Ex situ soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy results reveal the participation of oxygen anions in the electrochemical reactions. Thus, we explore the redox reactions of transition metals and oxygen to explain the mechanism and the electrochemical performance for the P2-type Mn/Fe-based layered cathodes.\n \n References\n \n [1] J.-M.

        "abstract": "Sodium-selenium (Na-Se) batteries are promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries for energy storage systems owing to their high energy density and natural abundance of Na resources. However, their drawbacks of low Se loading, dissolution of intermediate sodium polyselenides in the electrolyte and volumetric expansion of Se impede their real applications. To address these issues, herein, we report a multifunctional Se host with MoSe2 nanosheets coupled with nitrogen-doped porous carbon hollow spheres for the first time. The N-doped hollow carbon sphere structure could provide a large space for Se loading (Se content up to 72 wt%) and accommodate the volume expansion of Se species upon cycling. MoSe2 was chosen as a polar coupling component for the carbon matrix, owing to its low conversion reaction voltage. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the MoSe2 nanosheets coupled with hollow spheres could enhance the adsorption energy of the host to polyselenides chemically, which benefits the immobilization of polyselenides. Therefore, as a cathode for Na-Se batteries, the as-prepared composite exhibits excellent energy storage performance with long cycling life and superior rate performance. Our study of introducing transition metal selenides into Na-Se batteries may stimulate the designing of diverse Se-based cathodes.",

Among the various electrolytes investigated, sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI) (0.5 M) in BMPTFSI shows the best electrochemical performance with a significant improvement in cycling stability (90% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 50 mA g-1 in a half cell versus Na metal anode) compared with conventional NaClO4 (1 M) in ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate electrolytes (39% retention after 500 cycles). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies reveal that ionic liquid electrolytes are stable up to 4.8 V versus Na/Na+. When NaFSI and NaTFSI are used as conducting salts, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results prove that the cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) is composed of components resulting from the decomposition of the TFSI anion and the deposition of the BMP cation. On the other hand, the CEI layer of the electrode cycled in an electrolyte containing NaClO4 in BMPTFSI follows a different pathway of TFSI decomposition and consists mainly of sodium fluoride. Similarly, plating studies were used to understand the stability of different ionic liquids in contact with metallic sodium. It was found that the excellent capacity retention for the electrolyte consisting of NaFSI salt is related to the formation of a stable CEI and solid electrolyte interphase layers.",

And organic anode materials play a promising role due to their tunable electrochemical performance. However, the insufficient electroactive sites lead to a low capacity, hindering the elevation of energy density. Thus, it is essential to design organic molecules with multiple redox-active sites. Herein, we propose a strategy to activate redox sites by regulating the spatial distribution of delocalized electrons within the conjugation system, and the quinone rings are successfully activated as new reversible Na-ion storage sites via enhancing the electron density. The obtained 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinonatocobalt (Co-DHBQ) with electroactive quinone rings exhibits a superior capacity of 183 mA h g-1 accompanied by a multiple-electron transfer.

However, practical applications of SIBs are plagued by the sluggish kinetics of sodium ions with large size in the host structure, which results in poor rate performance and rapid capacity decline. Herein, a self-templated approach was developed to synthesize MoS2 /Cu2 Se nanosheets with improved interfacial electron- and ion-transfer kinetics. The MoS2 /Cu2 Se nanosheets provided superior sodium storage performance, delivering 139 mAh g-1 at a high current density of 100 A g-1 and 222 mAh g-1 after 14000 cycles (at 20 A g-1 ). The outstanding electrochemical performance was attributed to the synergetic engineering of interface and structure, which could enhance the electrochemical kinetics and gave excellent mechanical properties to deal with the volume expansion phenomenon. Combined with a high-voltage cathode, the full battery demonstrated a high energy density of 152 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 420 W kg-1 , which opens a new avenue for the development of high-performance SIBs.",

        "title": "Bilayering Enables Faster Charging and High Areal Capacity of Na-Ion Electrodes",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) are a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), which currently dominate electric vehicle and portable device applications. But while NIBs have potential cost and safety advantages, they still lag behind LIBs in capacity, power output and longevity. Considerable research and development effort is now being expended to develop more energy-dense electrodes in order for NIBs to become commercially viable.\n A possible route to increasing the energy density of NIBs is to increase electrode thickness (and therefore areal capacity), from presently used ~50 μm to 100 - 150 μm. However, achieving this in practice is limited by multiple factors related to manufacturing and rate performance of thicker electrodes. Slot-die coating is the dominant manufacturing process for electrodes, which involves mixing of active material, conductive additive, binder and solvent, coating the resulting slurry onto current collecting foil, and drying. The drying step places a practical limit on the dried thickness, as it is accompanied by binder migration away from the current collector, potentially reducing the adhesion and mechanical strength of the electrode. As a result, the maximum thickness of electrodes in industry is typically constrained to 50 - 90 µm. Furthermore, given the mobility of Na ions in the electrolyte in the torturous electrode pore network is normally restricted, thicker electrodes undergo greater polarisation and capacity loss as C-rate (current density) is increased. This means thicker electrodes cannot be charged/discharged quickly without detriment to energy density.\n Here we present a novel bilayer architecture of Na-ion positive electrodes obtained through slurry casting two successive sub-layers of different active materials: sodium manganese oxide (Na0.7MnO2, NMO) and sodium vanadium phosphate (Na3V2(PO4)3, NVP). The bilayer electrodes are 100 µm thick with high areal loading of ≈17 mg/cm2, which might normally be expected to inhibit high-rate performance. As expected, for low current densities < 1C ≡ 45 mA/gcm2, the charge capacity of the bilayer cathodes is similar and comparable to a simple, homogeneous (i.e. random) mixture of the two active materials, regardless of how the sub-layers are arranged. However, at 2C and 3C, overall electrode capacity is revealed to be sensitive to the microstructural arrangement, such as the relative position of NMO and NVP sub-layers. There is a significant increase in retained capacity when the NMO sub-layer is on the current collector. In order to understand the sensitivity of overall capacity to structural arrangement, simulations were performed that are formulated in a way to capture the designed microstructural heterogeneity of the electrodes. The simulations show the complex interaction between the voltage-capacity profile of the active material, the relative position of the sub-layer, and the evolution of Na ion gradients through the thickness of the electrode. In the most favourable arrangement, the dispersion of local overpotential due to local concentration polarization effects is reduced, which in turn enables greater utilization of the active materials. The sensitivity of sub-layer position is shown to relate to the significant difference in voltage-capacity profiles of NMO and NVP. Differences in charge-transfer resistance, electrical conductivity, and ionic mobility within the two materials also have a role in how the critical Na ion concentration profile evolves through the charge/discharge cycle.\n We discuss how the concept of layered or other types of structured electrode might be applied to Na ion batteries, and to what extent these effects might increase the competitiveness of Na ion batteries compared with their more established LIB counterparts.\n \n \n \n \n Figure 1\n",

However, the materials have poor electrical conductivity and mediocre energy density, which hinder their practical applications. Activating the V4+/V5+ redox couple (V4+/V5+≈4.1 V vs Na+/Na) is an effective way to elevate the energy density of SIBs, whereas the irreversible phase transition of V4+/V5+ and severe structural distortion will inevitably result in fast capacity fading and unsatisfactory rate capability. Herein, a high entropy regulation strategy is proposed to optimize the detailed crystal structure and improve the reversibility of crystalline phase transformation and electrical conductivity of the material.

        "abstract": "Sodium (Na) super-ionic conductor structured Na3MnTi(PO4)3 (NMTP) cathodes have garnered interest owing to their cost-effectiveness and high operating voltages.

Taking ZnS/NCF as an example, the material exhibits a high specific capacity of up to 715.5 mAh g-1 (100 cycles) and 455 mAh g-1 (50 cycles) at 0.1 A g-1 for LIBs and SIBs, respectively. This versatile approach for employing a fungus as a sustainable template to form high-performance electrodes may provide a systematic platform for implementing advanced battery designs.",

        "abstract": "Reliable operation of Na‐ion batteries requires a mastering of the interfacial processes governing intercalation kinetics. Ion desolvation, amongst others, is a crucial phenomenon as far as power applications are envisioned. Studying the intricacies of interfacial processes faces experimental challenges. Here the complementary use of electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) and operando infrared fiber evanescent wave spectroscopy (IR‐FEWS) combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is reported to investigate the electrode/electrolyte interface of polyanionic Na‐insertion compounds Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) and Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF). Through screening of various electrolytes that differ in their solvation energy and viscosity, the existence of an unusual mass uptake/depletion signal is demonstrated at the NVP interfaces only, indicative of a dissimilarity in migration kinetics of solvent molecules between NVP and NVPF interfaces as supported by IR‐FEWS. This finding is rationalized by positing that sodium depletion is caused by the unusually rapid ion diffusion within NVP mediated by an intermediate metastable phase, which leads to opposite Na+ concentration and free solvent molecule gradients at the interface that causes the unusual and anomalous feature observed on EQCM frequency profiles. This feature does not appear with NVPF showing lower ionic diffusion. Altogether, this fundamental study provides valuable fundamental insights into the interface structuring of insertion compounds depending upon their Na+ mobility.",

Electrolytes containing 1,1,2,2-tetramethoxyethane (tetramethoxyglyoxal, TMG), 1,1,2,2-tetraethoxyethane (tetraethoxyglyoxal, TEG) and a mixture of the latter with propylene carbonate (PC) exhibit increased thermal stabilities and higher flash points compared to classical electrolytes based on carbonates as solvents. Due to its favorable properties, 1 M NaTFSI in TEG:PC (3:7), has been selected and used for sodium-ion energy storage systems based on a Prussian Blue (PB) positive electrode and a hard carbon negative electrode. Compared to conventional electrolyte (based on a 1:1 mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC)), this glyoxylic-acetal electrolyte provides competitive capacity and prolonged cycle life. Post mortem XPS analysis indicates that the electrode-electrolyte interphases formed in presence of TEG are thicker and presumably more protective, inhibiting typical degradation processes of the electrodes. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the suitable properties of TEG on the cycling stability can also be exploited for the construction of highly stable sodium-ion capacitors.",

        "abstract": "Advancing electrochemical energy storage devices relies on versatile analytical tools capable of revealing the molecular mechanisms behind the function and degradation of battery materials in situ. The nuclear magnetic resonance phenomenon plays a pivotal role in fundamental studies of energy materials and devices because of its exceptional sensitivity to local environments and the dynamics of many electrochemically relevant elements. The jelly roll architecture is one of the most energy-dense and, therefore, most popular concepts implemented in pouch, prismatic, and cylindrical Li- and Na-ion cells. Such widely commercialized designs, however, represent a significant obstacle for a range of powerful in situ magnetic resonance-based methodologies due to negligible radio frequency electromagnetic field penetration through conductive metal casings and current collectors. In this work, we introduce an experimental setup that enables direct RF wave transmission through the cell terminals and current collectors, and provides efficient excitation and detection of NMR signals. An RF adapter designed as a plug-and-play device effectively turns the battery cell into an NMR probe that can be tuned to a broad range of Larmor frequencies. Due to its exceptional sensitivity, versatility, and multinuclear capability, the proposed methodology is suitable for fundamental research and industrial high-throughput screening applications. In situ NMR lineshapes provide a direct quantitative description of the chemical environments of electrochemically active elements and enable new metrics for the accurate assessment of state-of-charge (SoC) and state-of-health (SoH). Specifically, in commercial pouch cells based on lithium cobalt oxide, lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide, and sodium nickel iron manganese oxide chemistries, 7Li and 23Na NMR data unambiguously show electrochemical transformations between intercalated and metallic forms of charge carrier ions, and reveal anisotropic magnetic properties of the electrode coating.",

However, such a unique solvation structure inevitably injures the ionic conductivity of electrolytes and limits the fast-charging performance. Herein, a trade-off in tuning anion-reinforced solvation structure and high ionic conductivity is realized by the entropy-assisted hybrid ester-ether electrolyte. Anion-reinforced solvation sheath with more anions occupying the inner Na+ shell is constructed by introducing the weakly coordinated ether tetrahydrofuran into the commonly used ester-based electrolyte, which merits the accelerated desolvation energy and gradient inorganic-rich electrode-electrolyte interface. The improved ionic conductivity is attributed to the weakly diverse solvation structures induced by entropy effect. These enable the enhanced rate performance and cycling stability of Prussian blue||hard carbon full cells with high electrode mass loading. More importantly, the practical application of the designed electrolyte was further demonstrated by industry-level 18650 cylindrical cells.",

Pure orthorhombic single-phase powders were prepared under air, using an autocombustion synthesis method. They crystallize in the orthorhombic Imma space group with similar unit cell parameters [a = 10.1592(2), b = 13.0321(3), c = 6.4864(2) Å] and [a = 10.3993(1), b = 13.1966(1), c = 6.4955(1) Å] for β-Na2Ni2M(PO4)3 (NNAP) and β-Na2Ni2Fe(PO4)3 (NNFP), respectively. Crystal structures of both compounds were determined using X-ray powder diffraction and Rietveld method refinements, which indicate the occurrence of Ni2+ in the 8g site, and of M3+ in the 4a site of the structure. The structure consists of a three-dimensional anionic framework obtained by the association on MO6, NiO6, and PO4 polyhedra, sharing edges and corners. The resulting three-dimensional structure creates monodimensional channels along the [100] and [010] directions formed by face-shared oxygen polyhedra and occupied by Na+ cations. This nondisordered cationic distribution is confirmed by a significant change of magnetic properties. Thus, both NNAP and NNFP samples show paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition at 14 and 19 K, respectively. For the two compounds, thermal stability, electrical conductivity, and electrochemical properties have been also investigated. The intercalation/desintercalation properties of NNMP compounds as positive electrode were tested in sodium-ion batteries.

Importantly, an anion-derived passivation film is formed via preferential reduction of the anion upon charging, which can effectively suppress further electrolyte reduction. As a structural characteristic of the electrolyte, most anions are coordinated to multiple Na+ cations at high concentration, which shifts the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of the anions downward, resulting in preferential anion reduction.

        "abstract": "\n Introduction\n \n Although lithium-ion batteries, which are currently the most widely used batteries, have various advantages such as long life and high energy density, there are safety issues due to the uneven distribution of regions where lithium can be mined and the risk of ignition from organic solvents. Therefore, research and development of aqueous sodium-ion batteries, which have abundant resources and high safety, is underway. However, aqueous batteries have a low energy density, and the working potentials of the positive and negative electrodes must be within the potential window of water. Therefore, NaFePO4, which operates within about −0.6 − 0.6 V (vs. SHE) and has a high theoretical capacity of 154 mAh g−1, is promising. In a previous study, electrochemical properties were evaluated using NaFePO4 obtained by oxidizing LiFePO4 with NO2BF4 and reducing it with NaI, but its charge-discharge capacity was about 50% of the theoretical capacity, which remains challenges [1]. In this study, we prepared ion exchanged NaFePO4 (NFP) by electrochemical redox of LiFePO4 (LFP) and investigated its electrochemical properties to find an appropriate ion exchange method to achieve higher capacity.\n \n Experiments\n \n A mixture of LiFePO4 (LFP) powder as active material, a mixture of equal mass ratios of vapor grown carbon fiber (VGCF) and acetylene black (AB) as conductive additive, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as binder with a weight ratio of 7:2:1 was coated on a Ti foil and dried overnight. A beaker cell was assembled with a Pt electrode as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode as reference electrode.\n Hereafter, the potential is noted with reference to the Ag/AgCl electrode. Since the oxidation of LFP to FePO4 (FP) is known to occur at about 0.3 − 0.4 V and the reduction of FP to NFP at −0.3 − −0.4 V. [2] The LFP electrode was kept at 0.4 V for 6 hours after linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) to produce an oxidized FP electrode. The NFP electrode was then produced by reduction at −0.4 V for the same time. Charge-discharge measurements and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on the FP and NFP electrodes. For the charge-discharge measurements, the electrolyte was 1.0 mol dm−3 Na2SO4 aqueous solution, the current density was 77 mA g−1, and the cutoff potential was −0.4 − 0.4 V.\n \n Results and Discussion\n \n According to the XRD measurements in Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b), the peaks of the fabricated FP and NFP electrodes are generally consistent with the FP and NFP peaks expected from the ICSD database, respectively, but different from the LFP and FP peaks. Therefore, the oxidation from LFP to FP was well advanced, and the reduction of FP to NFP was also well progressive.\n Charge-discharge measurements showed two plateaus during the oxidation of NFP, suggesting that a two-step oxidation reaction was taking place. The obtained electrode had a reversible capacity of approximately 105 mAh g−1, which was greater than the reversible capacity of the electrode in a previous study [1]. This may be due to the ion-exchange NFP electrode having more Li+ desorption and Na+ insertion than the solid-state synthesis method.\n \n Conclusion\n \n NaFePO4 electrodes electrochemically ion-exchanged from LiFePO4 showed greater reversible capacities than electrodes prepared by conventional solid-state synthesis. The results show that the NaFePO4 synthesis method of electrochemical ion exchange is superior.\n \n References\n \n [1] A.J. Fernández-Ropero, D. Saurel , B. Acebedo , T. Rojo , M. Casas-Cabanas J.

        "abstract": "The mechanical strength and ionic conductivity of sulfide solid electrolytes have received widespread attention for their application in solid sodium batteries. Herein, first-principles calculations are used to determine the properties, including the electronic, mechanical and ionic transport properties, of Na3PS4 sulfide solid electrolytes doped with low and high Ca ion concentrations. Our theoretical results demonstrate that low Ca ion concentrations can be easily doped in tetragonal and cubic phases (t-Na3PS4 and c-Na3PS4) and create a suitable number of Na vacancies based on the formation energy analysis. Furthermore, the calculated density of states and charge density differences indicate that the surrounding electronic environment is changed, and Ca-S ionic bonds are formed in Na3PS4 with Ca-doping. In addition, the improved ductility and mechanical strength of c-Na3PS4 and t-Na3PS4 achieved by low-concentration Ca doping may help suppress dendritic growth and electrode deformation. Finally, sodium ion migration in Ca-doped Na3PS4 is described with the aid of the CI-NEB method, and it is found that the migration energy barriers are less than those of pure Na3PS4, which suggests that the sodium ion conductivity can be effectively improved by doping with low Ca2+ concentrations. The present work improves the understanding of the influence of doping on the performance of solid electrolytes and provides a feasible framework for the future design of high-performance solid electrodes.",

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheet is a promising negative electrode candidate for sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) owing to its easy scalability, low cost, chemical stability and potentially high rate capability. However, intrinsic g-C3N4 exhibits poor electronic conductivity, low reversible Na-storage capacity and insufficient cyclability. Our density functional theory calculation suggests that this is due to a large Na+ ion diffusion barrier in the innate g-C3N4 nanosheet. Here we strategically apply a facile one-pot heating of a mixture of low-cost urea and asphalt to yield stacked multilayer C/g-C3N4 composites with improved Na-storage capacity (about 2 times higher than that of g-C3N4, up to 254 mAh/g), rate capability and cyclability. A C/g-C3N4 sodium-ion full cell (in which sodium rhodizonate dibasic is used as the positive electrode) demonstrates high Coulombic efficiency (~99.8%) and a negligible capacity fading over 14,000 cycles at 1 A/g. The design of the C/g-C3N4 negative electrode material offers effective strategies to develop low-cost and long-life NIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium ion (Na+)-based electrochemical systems have been extensively investigated in batteries and supercapacitors and also can be quality candidates for electrochromic (EC) devices. However, poor diffusion kinetics and severe EC performance degradation occur during the intercalation/deintercalation processes because the ionic radii of Na+ are larger than those of conventional intercalation ions. Here, through intentional design of ion-transport channels in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), Na+ serves as an efficient intercalation ion for incorporation into a nanostructured electrode with a high diffusion coefficient of approximately 10-8 cm2 s-1. As a result, the well-designed MOF-based EC device demonstrates desirable Na+ EC performance, including fast switching speed, multicolor switching, and high stability. A smart \"quick response code\" display is fabricated using a mask-free laser writing method for application in the \"Internet of Things\". In addition, the concept of ion transport pathway design can be widely adopted for fabricating high-performance ion intercalation materials and devices for consumer electronics.",

        "abstract": "The chemical environments of the interlayer Na sites of layered titanate are finely controlled by the intercalation of n-alkylamine with various alkyl chain lengths to explore an effective way to improve its electrode functionality for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The n-alkylamine intercalation via ion-exchange and exfoliation-restacking routes allows the modification of in-plane structures of layered titanate to be tuned. Among the present n-alkylamine-intercalates, the n-pentylamine-intercalated titanate shows the largest discharge capacity with the best rate characteristics, underscoring the critical role of optimized intracrystalline structure in improving the SIB electrode performance of layered titanate. The creation of turbostratic in-plane structure degrades the SIB electrode performance of layered titanate, indicating the detrimental effect of in-plane structural disorder on electrode activity. 23Na magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrates that the n-alkylamine-intercalated titanates possess two different interlayer Na+ sites near ammonium head groups/titanate layers and near alkyl chains. The intercalation of long-chain molecules increases the population of the latter site and the overall mobility of Na+ ions, which is responsible for the improvement of electrode activity upon n-alkylamine intercalation. The present study highlights that the increased population of interlayer metal sites remote from the host layers is effective in improving the electrode functionality of layered metal oxide for SIBs and multivalent ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "\n Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)2F3 with their relatively high capacities and redox potentials are among the most studied and applied positive electrode materials in non-aqueous sodium-ion batteries. However, their stability in aqueous environments is relatively low limiting the application of these materials in aqueous batteries or deionization cells. In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis of Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)2F3 degradation in aqueous media using a number of techniques such as standard electrochemical methods, elemental analysis, powder X-ray diffractometry, and rotating ring-disc electrode method. The latter allows for real time in situ/operando degradation analysis. The results show that Na3V2(PO4)3 suffers from chemical vanadium dissolution in neutral pH, whereas it is negligible in Na3V2(PO4)2F3. The results obtained in unbuffered electrolytes by the ring-disc electrode technique explicitly show that Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)2F3 generate most of the soluble V(V) species during the charging process. Whereas at lower pH, there is an additional electrochemically-induced generation of soluble V(IV) species during discharging as well. The overall results suggest that fluoride ions significantly increase the structural stability of phosphate materials in aqueous environments and a careful electrolyte design with controlled proton and water activity could enable the use of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 in water-based electrochemical devices.",

Based on the eutectic composition of the NaFSA–KFSA (56:44 mol/mol) binary system, the superconcentrated solutions of 35 mol kg–1 Na0.55K0.45FSA/H2O and 33 mol kg–1 Na0.45K0.55FSA/H2O are found to form at 25 °C. As both electrolytes demonstrate a wider potential window of ∼3.5 V compared to that of either saturated 20 mol kg–1 NaFSA or 31 mol kg–1 KFSA solution, we applied the 33 mol kg–1 Na0.45K0.55FSA/H2O to two different battery configurations, carbon-coated Na2Ti2(PO4)3∥K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] and carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3∥K2Mn[Fe(CN)6]. The former cell shows highly reversible charge/discharge curves with a mean discharge voltage of 1.4 V. Although the latter cell exhibits capacity degradation, it demonstrates 2 V-class operations. Analysis data of the two cells confirmed that Na+ ions were mainly inserted into the negative electrodes passivated by a Na-rich solid electrolyte interphase, and both Na+ and K+ ions were inserted into the positive electrode. Based upon the observation, we propose new sodium-/potassium-ion batteries using the superconcentrated NaFSA–KFSA aqueous electrolytes.",

        "abstract": "Aqueous electrolytes can be used for electrical double-layer capacitors, pseudocapacitors, and intercalation-type batteries. These technologies may employ different electrode materials, most importantly high-surface-area nanoporous carbon, two-dimensional materials, and metal oxides. All of these materials also find more and more applications in electrochemical desalination devices. During the electrochemical operation of such electrode materials, charge storage and ion immobilization are accomplished by non-Faradaic ion electrosorption, Faradaic ion intercalation at specific crystallographic sites, or ion insertion between layers of two-dimensional materials. These processes may or may not be associated with a (partial) loss of the aqueous solvation shell around the ions. Our work showcases the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance as an excellent tool for quantifying the change in effective solvation. We chose sodium as an important cation for energy storage materials (sodium-based aqueous electrolytes) and electrochemical desalination (saline media). Our data show that a major amount of water uptake occurs during ion electrosorption in nanoporous carbon, while battery-like ion insertion between layers of titanium disulfide is associated with an 80% loss of the initially present solvation molecules. Sodiation of MXene is accomplished by a loss of 90% of the number of solvent molecules, but nanoconfined water in-between the MXene layers may compensate for this large degree of desolvation. In the case of sodium manganese oxide, we were able to demonstrate the full loss of the solvation shell.",

This system achieves super high desalination capacity, excellent cycling stability, and rapid desalination rate. The desalination capacity is as high as 107.5 mg g-1 after 50 cycles with the current density of 100 mA g-1 .

        "abstract": "Lithium-ion batteries are one of the most used power sources in a variety of fields: microelectronics, portable devices, automotive or even stationary energy storage. The huge growth of the Li-ion battery market raises concerns about the limited availability of lithium resources and its rising cost of acquisition. To counteract that effect, scientists again focused on sodium, as a cheaper and easily acquirable element to use in electrochemical power sources [1, 2].\n In principle, sodium-ion batteries operate through similar mechanisms as lithium-ion cells, where Na+ ions are charge carriers between negative and positive electrodes. Most of the electrode materials used in the Na-ion technology come from their widely used analogues in Li-ion systems. However, due to differences in ion transport, reaction kinetics and Solid Electrolyte Interphase layer composition, there is a need for extensive studies to be carried out before the wide commercialisation of Na-ion batteries can take place [2].\n In this presentation, we show our results from research on Na-ion battery systems, based on carbon and phosphate chemistries. From the negative electrode side, carbonaceous materials prepared in our lab showed good capacities (ca. 200 mAh g-1), outstanding cyclability and high-rate performance (above 95% and 50% capacity retention during cyclability and high-rate tests, respectively). For the positive electrode, transition metal phosphates obtained through various synthetic routes also showed excellent performance (above 95% and 95% capacity retention during cyclability and high-rate tests, respectively) in Na-ion cells. Materials with the best electrochemical performances were used to construct a full Na-ion battery, which showed promising results in full-cell geometry and the feasibility of carbon and phosphate chemistries in the development of post-lithium battery systems.\n \n Acknowledgements: This work was supported by The Polish National Centre of Science through a research grant 2021/43/D/ST5/01220 entitled “High-voltage sodium-ion batteries based on exfoliated graphite electrodes”.\n Literature:\n [1] Jamesh, M.

Despite the concern about limited lithium resources, scientists have re-examined sodium-ion batteries, since sodium is below lithium on the periodic table, and the two metals have many similar properties. As a result of its low cost, good cycle life, and reversible capacity, hard carbon (HC) is considered to be the most attractive negative electrode material for sodium-ion batteries. Nevertheless, the practical application of HC remains challenging due to its low capacity and initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). We investigated how pre-treatment conditions affected the graphitization degree in order to overcome these issues. In addition, we observed a strong correlation between pre-oxidation and electrochemical performance when the carbonization temperature was increased.

Synthesizing L-TiO2 functional materials for high-capacity and long cyclability battery remains challenging due to the unstable and poor conductivity of bare L-TiO2 . In nature, plant growth can stabilize land by preventing sands from dispersing following desertification.

After annealing and etching processes (similar to desertification), NH2 -MIL-101(Al) is transformed into interconnected N/O-doped carbon (MOF-NOC), which not only acts as a plant-like function to prevent the pulverization of L-TiO2 transformed from Ti3 C2 Tx but also improves the conductivity and stability of MOF-NOC@L-TiO2 . Al species are selected as seeds to improve interfacial compatibility and form intimate interface heterojunction. Systematic ex situ analysis discloses that the ions storage mechanism can be endowed by mixed contribution of non-Faradaic and Faradaic capacitance.

In potassium-ion batteries (KIBs), MnSe/ZnSe@HCTs deliver a higher specific capacity of 422 mAh g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1 and maintain a high coulombic efficiency of 99% after 1000 cycles. The yolk-shell structured MnSe/ZnSe heterojunction demonstrates excellent electrode properties for high-performance sodium/potassium batteries, holding significant promise for future energy storage applications.",

        "title": "Water/DMSO-Based Hybrid Electrolyte and Urea Additive Engineering for Performance Regulation in Aqueous Sodium Batteries",
        "abstract": "\n Electrochemical energy storage devices are of interest, especially aqueous sodium ion batteries(ASIBs), due to their safety, low-cost, and environmental friendliness. However, ASIBs suffer from poor cyclic stability and a narrow electrochemical window, which hinders their large-scale application. Compared to the traditional dilute saline electrolytes, high concentration electrolytes show a wider potential window. In this study, we designed a novel NaClO4-H2O/DMSO-Urea hybrid electrolyte to suppress these problems, in which DMSO and Urea create a synergistic effect. The formation of hydrogen bonds between DMSO and H2O reduced water activity, thereby suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction. The addition of DMSO resulted in the reduction from -1.2 to -1.6 V for the hydrogen evolution potential. Therefore, we were able to expand the electrochemical window on the basis of reducing the concentration of sodium salts. Moreover, the addition of Urea facilitated formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface on the electrode surface, which improved the cycling stability of NVP/C (Na3V2(PO3)4/C) symmetric cell which exhibited a specific capacity of 59.7 mAh g-1 with the retention capacity of 80.1 % after 200 cycles at 1 C. This work points out a promising strategy for developing stable and wide voltage aqueous electrolyte.",

        "title": "The effect of salt anion in ether‐based electrolyte for electrochemical performance of sodium‐ion batteries: A case study of hard carbon",
        "abstract": "Compared with the extensively used ester‐based electrolyte, the hard carbon (HC) electrode is more compatible with the ether‐based counterpart in sodium‐ion batteries, which can lead to improved cycling stability and robust rate capability. However, the impact of salt anion on the electrochemical performance of HC electrodes has yet to be fully understood. In this study, the anionic chemistry in regulating the stability of electrolytes and the performance of sodium‐ion batteries have been systematically investigated. This work shows discrepancies in the reductive stability of the anionic group, redox kinetics, and component/structure of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) with different salts (NaBF4, NaPF6, and NaSO3CF3) in the typical ether solvent (diglyme). Particularly, the density functional theory calculation manifests the preferred decomposition of PF6− due to the reduced reductive stability of anions in the solvation structure, thus leading to the formation of NaF‐rich SEI. Further investigation on redox kinetics reveals that the NaPF6/diglyme can induce the fast ionic diffusion dynamic and low charge transfer barrier for HC electrode, thus resulting in superior sodium storage performance in terms of rate capability and cycling life, which outperforms those of NaBF4/diglyme and NaSO3CF3/diglyme. Importantly, this work offers valuable insights for optimizing the electrochemical behaviors of electrode materials by regulating the anionic group in the electrolyte.",

Tellurium (Te) is a promising alternative electrode for storage of K+ ions due to its high volumetric capacity, confirmed in lithium‐/sodium‐ion batteries, and the intrinsic good electronic conductivity. However, the charge storage capability and mechanism of Te in potassium‐ion batteries (KIBs) have not been unveiled until now. Here, a novel K–Te battery is constructed, and the K+‐ion storage mechanism of Te is revealed to be a two‐electron conversion‐type reaction of 2K + Te ↔ K2Te, resulting in a high theoretical volumetric capacity of 2619 mAh cm−3. Consequently, the rationally fabricated tellurium/porous carbon electrodes deliver an ultrahigh reversible volumetric capacity of 2493.13 mAh cm−3 at 0.5 C (based on Te), a high‐rate capacity of 783.13 mAh cm−3 at 15 C, and superior long‐term cycling stability for 1000 cycles at 5 C.

An average capacity of 50 mAh g−1 at 200 mA g−1 was stabilized when cycling up to 300 cycles.

As x increases, we evidence a strong deformation of the tetrahedral sites occupied by sodium ions, leading to new highly stable sites for these inserted ions at x  =  2.

        "abstract": "Through a facile sodium sulfide (Na2S)‐assisted hydrothermal treatment, clean and nondefective surfaces are constructed on micrometer‐sized Li4Ti5O12 particles. The remarkable improvement of surface quality shows a higher first cycle Coulombic efficiency (≈95%), a significantly enhanced cycling performance, and a better rate capability in electrochemical measurements. A combined study of Raman spectroscopy and inductive coupled plasma emission spectroscopy reveals that the evolution of Li4Ti5O12 surface in a water‐based hydrothermal environment is a hydrolysis–recrystallization process, which can introduce a new phase of anatase‐TiO2. While, with a small amount of Na2S (0.004 mol L−1 at least), the spinel‐Li4Ti5O12 phase is maintained without a second phase. During this process, the alkaline environment created by Na2S and the surface adsorption of the sulfur‐containing group (HS− or S2−) can suppress the recrystallization of anatase‐TiO2 and renew the particle surfaces. This finding gives a better understanding of the surface–property relationship on Li4Ti5O12 and guidance on preparation and modification of electrode material other than coating or doping.",

        "title": "Comparative life cycle assessment of lithium‐ion, sodium‐ion, and solid‐state battery cells for electric vehicles",
        "abstract": "The transition toward electrification of transportation has resulted in a rapid increase in the demand for battery cells. While this demand is currently being met through the use of lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), alternative batteries like sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) and solid‐state batteries (SSBs) are emerging as relevant alternatives. In this study, we analyze, based on current electric vehicle electrode stack designs, the environmental impact of LIB cells, SIB cells, and SSB cells. The life cycle assessment results from this cradle‐to‐gate study show that for LIB cell production today, ∼58–92 kgCO2‐eq are emitted per kWhcell and ∼296–624 kWhCED/kWhcell of primary energy is required. In SIB cell production, ∼75–87 kgCO2‐eq/kWhcell is emitted, and in SSB cell production, ∼88–130 kgCO2‐eq/kWhcell, depending on their specific electrode stack configuration. The results demonstrate that LFP (lithium–iron–phosphate) cells require the least energy for production across all battery types under analysis. Furthermore, the findings indicate that, in terms of global warming potential (GWP), LFP and NMC900 (nickel–manganese–cobalt) cells are the most sustainable battery types, at least when focusing solely on battery cell production and neglecting subsequent use phases. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that by optimizing the cell designs and their production, the environmental impact of battery cell production can be reduced in the short term by up to −38%. This allows the production of LFP battery cells with a low GWP of ∼37 kgCO2‐eq/kWhcell and NMC900 cells with ∼44 kgCO2‐eq/kWhcell. Moreover, there is considerable room for improvement in other major LIB cell types. This article met the requirements for a gold‐gold JIE data openness badge described at http://jie.click/badges.",

        "abstract": "Developing super-foldable electronic materials and devices presents a significant challenge, as intrinsic conductive materials are unable to achieve numerous true-folding operations (super-foldable) due to limitations from short-range forces of chemical bonds. Consequently, super-foldable batteries remain unexplored. This work focused on sodium-ion batteries as a breakthrough point to advance super-foldable devices. By employing a \"2+1\" bioinspired strategy, we stepwise designed and assembled super-foldable components, from substrates to electrodes, and to ultimately device. This bioinspired approach completely disperses folding stress and thus prevents the breakage of chemical bonds, enabling the successful fabrication of the first super-foldable ion battery. This battery can withstand true-folding at any angle, in any direction, and for an unprecedented number of cycles-far outperforming current foldable phones with hinge structures. Remarkably, after 500,000 true-folding cycles, the battery's microstructure remains intact with no significant degradation of electrochemical performance. Real-time dynamic folding observations reveal an M-shaped folding structure within the bioinspired materials, which effectively disperses stress via bulged layers, dispersed arcs, and slidable microgrooves that work together across different directions and dimensions to achieve super-foldability. Mechanical simulations vividly verify this principle. This work represents a breakthrough in super-foldable devices, offering valuable insights and promoting practical application for future super-foldable devices.",

        "abstract": "Herein, we detail an approach to accelerate the computational screening of materials for properties dictated by the kinetics of solid state diffusion through reliably and rapidly identifying upper and lower bounds to the transition state (TS) energy through our proposed modified single iteration synchronous-transit (MSIST) approach. While this sacrifices providing detailed information of the explicit TS structure, it requires only ~30% of the force evaluations of a full nudged elastic band (NEB) TS search and reduces the computational demand to compute estimated diffusion barriers by 70% on average. In all 53 cases in which we explicitly compared our results to those of an NEB calculation, the upper and lower bounds identified using this approach bracketed the TS energy calculated with explicit NEB calculations. We use the applications of diffusion of Na+ in potential sodium-ion battery electrodes and oxygen vacancy diffusion in solid oxide fuel cell electrodes and redox mediators for solar thermochemical hydrogen production to demonstrate the power of MSIST for analyzing the kinetics of bulk diffusion. For Na+ diffusion through 13 proposed electrode materials in which the average diffusion barrier was 0.28 eV, the average difference between the upper and lower bounds was 0.08 eV. An iterative application of this approach to the 3 materials with the largest difference between their upper and lower bounds further narrowed the average range of the bounded TS energies to 0.04 eV, while still requiring fewer force evaluations than an NEB TS calculation. When applied in a high throughput manner to study 514 diffusion pathways in 97 different materials, the average difference between the upper and lower bounds was 0.33 eV and the average barrier, as calculated by the average of all upper and lower bounds, was ~1.7 eV. Because the MSIST approach produces explicit errors, i.e. the difference between the upper and lower bounds energies, even predicted barrier ranges with large errors can be reliably modeled with weighted regression techniques. MSIST enables the analysis of the kinetics of solid state diffusion across larger sets of materials and can thus efficiently provide data to train statistically learned models of diffusion and to develop physical insights into the diffusion process.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon is one of the most promising candidates for a negative electrode material for sodium-ion batteries. Now, the design and adaptation of methods for producing hard carbon have gained wide attention in terms of not only ensuring the required electrochemical performance but also reducing production costs and expenses. Herein, we report a method for preparing new functional materials based on hard carbon doped with molybdenum. A viscose was used as a carbon precursor because of its low cost and availability, which made it possible to scale the technology. An ammonium molybdate aqueous solution was applied as the molybdenum source. The synthesis involves following main steps: impregnation of the fiber with a solution of ammonium molybdate and annealing at high temperatures under controlled atmosphere. The study investigates the effects of the type of initial viscose raw material (microfiber, technical thread, non-woven material), molybdenum content (Mo/C weight ratio varied in the range up to 5.1%), temperature (up to 1050 °C), and annealing atmosphere (argon or nitrogen) on the structural parameters, specific surface area, and yield of hard carbon products. The doped hard carbon has an almost 10% higher yield in comparison with the undoped one. It was shown that doping with molybdenum, due to the catalytic effect, stimulates the growth and ordering of graphite-like nanoclusters under the temperature, inducing the structure formation of hard carbon. This leads to a decrease in the temperature of hard carbon production as compared to analogues. It was found that changing the specific surface area with temperature depends on the molybdenum content. The lowest values of specific surface area were found for doped samples synthesized at 1050 °C. \nFor citation: \n Saenko N.S., Zheleznov V.V., Mayorov V.Yu., Opra D.P.

        "abstract": "The development of novel redox-active polymers for sustainable sodium ion batteries (SIBs) has captured growing attention, but battery performance has been significantly limited by poor reversible specific capacities, where the majority of aromatic C6-benzene linkages are redox inactive. Here, a simple, yet efficient approach to improve sodium (Na) storage on these C6-benzene rings within a porous polymeric framework by rationally regulating their steric hindrance is reported. Decreasing intrinsic hindrance affords a significant improvement in redox reaction kinetics within the porous architecture, thereby facilitating the acceptance of Na ions on these functionalized benzene rings and boosting the SIB performance. As a result, the modulate porous framework exhibits an exceptional battery capacity of 376 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1 , which is ≈1.5 times larger than that of the pristine framework. Furthermore, the performance can reach as high as 510 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 , comparable to that of the best-performing polymeric electrodes. The simple modulation approach not only enables Na storage modulation on functionalized C6-benzene rings, but also simultaneously provides a means to extend the understanding of the structure-property relationship and facilitate new possibilities for organic SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The rational design of hierarchical hollow nanomaterials is of critical significance in energy storage materials. Herein, dual-wall hollow nanospheres (DWHNS) Sn/MoS2@C are constructed by in situ confined growth and interface engineering. The inner hollow spheres of Sn/MoS2 are formed by atomic soldering MoS2 nanosheets with liquid Sn at high temperature. The formation mechanism of the hierarchical structure is explored by the morphology evolutions at different temperatures. The DWHNS Sn/MoS2@C manifest abundant inner space and high specific surface area, which provides more support sites for Li+/Na+/K+ storage and alleviates the volume effect of tin-based electrode materials to a certain extent. The composite material manifests an outstanding specific capacity and satisfactory reversibility of lithium ion batteries (∼931 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 500 cycles), sodium ion batteries (∼432 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 400 cycles), and potassium ion batteries (∼226 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 300 cycles). Additionally, the morphology evolution and mechanism analysis of DWHNS Sn/MoS2@C in alkali metal ion batteries are verified by ex situ measurement, which confirms the three-in-one hybrid storage mechanism, i.e., intercalation reaction of carbon shells, conversion reaction of MoS2, and alloying reaction of tin.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have emerged as a strong contender among the beyond lithium-ion chemistries due to elemental abundance and the low cost of sodium. Tin (Sn) is a promising alloying electrode with high capacity, redox reversibility, and earth abundance. Tin electrodes, however, undergo a series of intermediate reactions exhibiting multiple voltage plateaus upon sodiation/desodiation. Phase transformations related to incomplete sodiation in tin during cycling, in the presence of a frail solid electrolyte interphase layer, can quickly weaken the structural stability. The structural dynamics and reactivity of the electrode/electrolyte interface, being further dependent on the size and morphology of the active material particle in the presence of different electrolytes, dictate the electrode degradation and survivability during cycling. In this study, we paint a comprehensive picture of the underpinnings of the electrochemical and mechanics coupling and electrode/electrolyte interfacial interactions in alloying Sn electrodes. We elicit the fundamental role of electrode/electrolyte complexations in the Sn electrode structure-property-performance relationship based on multimodal analytics, including electrochemical, microscopy, and tomography analyses.",

        "abstract": "An important material for realizing all-solid-state batteries is a solid electrolyte with high ionic conductivity and excellent compatibility with positive and negative electrodes. Compared to lithium-ion conductors, sodium-ion conducting sulfides are expected to have the advantages of high conductivity and favorable ductility due to the weaker Lewis acidity of sodium ions [1].\n Sulfide electrolytes with sodium-ion conductivity have been developed during the last decade. To achieve high ionic conductivity, it is effective to prepare glass electrolytes with high sodium content by the rapid-quenching or mechanochemical methods. Crystallization of glass electrolytes can enhance their conductivity by stabilizing a metastable crystalline phase in glass matrix. The conductivity of the Na3PS4 glass increased to 10−4 S cm−1 by crystallization [2]. We reported that the doping of sodium-ion vacancies in Na3SbS4 by partial substitution of W for Sb is effective in enhancing conductivity to the level of 10−1 S cm−1 [3,4]. Based on the high-temperature stability of sodium polysulfide melt, Na2.88Sb0.88W0.12S4 was synthesized directly from a stoichiometric mixture of Na2S, S, Sb and W by heating at ambient pressure followed by cooling [4].\n Glassy Na3BS3 was also prepared by the same synthetic procedure under ambient pressure without the use of a vacuum-tight container [4]. The Na3BS3 glass showed better Na plating/stripping performance than Na3PS4 and is suitable for contact with negative electrodes [5]. Therefore, an all-solid-state cell was fabricated by using two types of solid electrolytes, Na3BS3 on the Na15Sn4 negative electrode and Na2.88Sb0.88W0.12S4 on the TiS2 positive electrode. The cell operated as a rechargeable battery at room temperature and maintained the coulombic efficiency of almost 100% from the 2nd to 300th cycles [4].\n References\n [1] A.

Nevertheless, the lack of cost-effective and green preparation methods still greatly impedes the application of 2D carbon nanosheets in sodium-ion batteries. Herein, an environmental friendly and versatile strategy is proposed to engineer anisotropically curved nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (CNCNs) derived from biosources with hydrosoluble and recyclable flux. After undergoing serious corrosion from the LiCl/KCl binary flux, the resulting CNCNs possess high structural stability. Notably, the CNCNs also possess a rational specific surface area, open porous structure, and abundant accessible edges, which can shorten the ion-diffusion path, provide abundant accessible active sites, and result in less charge-transfer impedance and excellent sodium-ion diffusion coefficient (8.9×10-10  cm2  s-1 ). As a consequence, CNCN electrodes can deliver a high specific capacity of 361.6 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 . Such architecture provides a promising structural platform for the fabrication of 2D carbons for highly reversible and high capacity sodium-ion batteries.",

Indium is a soft metal that provides excellent adhesion and does not generate dendrites during the charge–discharge process. The solid‐state electrolyte material, sodium‐based silicate, is an environmentally friendly material that offers better thermal stability compared to liquid electrolytes and reduces packaging requirements. The positive electrode material, a graphite film (GF), features a layered structure, enabling the stable insertion and extraction of ions. In this experiment, graphite film doped sodium phosphate (GFN) are used as positive electrodes, sodium‐based silicate powder through cloth deposition (battery cloth deposition [BCD]) is used as the electrolyte and indium is used as the negative electrode. To improve the low capacity of indium electrodes, indium is alloyed with silver and prepared by thermal evaporation method. The results show that the In‐30Ag with Cu substrate (weight ratio of In‐30 wt.% Ag) exhibits higher cycling capacity (61 mAhg−1). To further increase the capacity, the substrate of In‐30Ag is replaced from copper foil to aluminum foil. According to result, the capacity of In‐30Ag with Al substrate (91 mAhg−1) exhibits 1.6 times higher compared to In‐30Ag with Cu substrate. However, In‐30Ag with Al substrate after vacuum heat treatment, the thin film exhibits melting and agglomeration, leading to a decrease in capacity.

We synthesized a porous CoS2/C micro-polyhedron composite entangled in a carbon-nanotube-based network (CoS2-C/CNT), starting from zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-67 as a single precursor. Following an efficient two-step synthesis strategy, the obtained CoS2 nanoparticles are uniformly embedded in porous carbonaceous micro-polyhedrons, interwoven with CNTs to ensure high electronic conductivity. The CoS2-C/CNT nanocomposite provides excellent bifunctional energy storage performance, delivering 1030 mAh g-1 after 120 cycles and 403 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles (at 100 mA g-1) as electrode for lithium-ion (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), respectively. In addition to these high capacities, the electrodes show outstanding rate capability and excellent long-term cycling stability with a capacity retention of 80% after 500 cycles for LIBs and 90% after 200 cycles for SIBs. In situ X-ray diffraction reveals a significant contribution of the partially graphitized carbon to the lithium and at least in part also for the sodium storage and the report of a two-step conversion reaction mechanism of CoS2, eventually forming metallic Co and Li2S/Na2S. Particularly the lithium storage capability at elevated (dis-)charge rates, however, appears to be substantially pseudocapacitive, thus benefiting from the highly porous nature of the nanocomposite.",

Herein, a rational hybridization strategy through hydrogen bond between organic molecule and inorganic substrate has been proposed, employing the terminal –C═O of trisodium 1, 2, 4‐benzenetricarboxylate (TBC) molecule and –OH groups of inorganic Ti3C2Tx MXene, respectively. In general, such a design evidently mitigates the aggregation of both TBC molecules and Ti3C2Tx MXene. Furthermore, the robust hydrogen bonding significantly mitigates the dissolution of TBC and guarantees the robust coupling between them, thus contributing to the integrity of electrode and modifying the electrochemical sodium storage in both half and full cells. Moreover, the systematic kinetic analysis and mechanism detection reveal improved charge transportation and robust two‐electron electrochemical reversibility of the hybrid TBC/Ti3C2Tx. Taken together, this work demonstrates a potential novel strategy toward stable and practical organic battery chemistries through hydrogen bonding with inorganic compounds.",

The influence of particle dispersion on electrochemical performance was investigated through polarization curve and AC impedance tests. It was found that PBAs with well-dispersed particles exhibited excellent rate performance, with a capacity of ~120 mAh g-1 at 1 C rate and a capacity retention of 75 % after 100 cycles. The capacity retention rate could reach 63 % at 5 C rate, far higher than that of PBAs samples with poor particle dispersion.

        "abstract": "In this work, tin-antimony/carbon composites porous fibers were successfully synthesized by an electrospinning method combined with two-step heat treatment processes, in which SnCl2 and SbCl3 were used as tin and antimony sources, and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) were used as binders and pore-forming agents. The as-synthesized tin-antimony/carbon composites were systematically characterized by x-ray Diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Energy-Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS), x-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and Thermogravimetric Analysis-Differential Scanning Calorimetry (TG-DSC). The results indicate that the composite material consists of one-dimensional nitrogen-doped carbon porous fibers as the main matrix, with a three-dimensional network structure in which Sn, SnO2, and SnSb particles are encapsulated. Furthermore, the tin-antimony/carbon composites porous fibers were utilized as self-supported negative electrode for sodium-ion batteries. The results showed that the SNbM-2 sample electrode calcined at 800 °C demonstrated the best cycling stability and rate capability among all the sample electrodes, with a discharge capacity of 319.5 mAh·g−1 maintained after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A·g−1. The excellent electrochemical performance of the SNbM-2 sample electrode is benefited from its unique porous structure and the carbon fiber network structure encapsulating Sn, SnO2, and SnSb particles, which could effectively shorten the Na+ ion transport distance and mitigate electrode volume expansion.",

        "abstract": "The increasing interest in Na-ion batteries (NIBs) can be traced to sodium abundance, its low cost compared to lithium, and its intercalation chemistry being similar to that of lithium. We report that the electrochemical properties of a promising negative electrode material, Na2Ti3O7, are improved by exfoliating its layered structure and forming 2D nanoscale morphologies, nanoplatelets, and nanosheets. Exfoliation of Na2Ti3O7 was carried out by controlling the amount of proton exchange for Na+ and then proceeding with the intercalation of larger cations such as methylammonium and propylammonium. An optimized mixture of nanoplatelets and nanosheets exhibited the best electrochemical performance in terms of high capacities in the range of 100-150 mA h g-1 at high rates with stable cycling over several hundred cycles. These properties far exceed those of the corresponding bulk material, which is characterized by slow charge-storage kinetics and poor long-term stability. The results reported in this study demonstrate that charge-storage processes directed at 2D morphologies of surfaces and few layers of sheets are an exciting direction for improving the energy and power density of electrode materials for NIBs.",

        "abstract": "Meeting the promise of all-solid-state batteries will require solid electrolytes that have high metal ion conductivity, low electronic conductivity, are electrochemically stable at both low and high potential, and have sufficiently high critical current density to avoid metal dendrite penetration. Metal borohydrides comprise a relatively new class of compounds that is being explored for its potential as a solid electrolyte material. Here, we examine the electrochemical thermodynamic stability of sodium amide borohydride (Na2NH2BH4, or NNB) over the potential range 1.5 to 5 V vs. Na/Na+, using electrodynamic methods, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization of the interfacial reaction products1, and electron microscopy characterization of microstructure. We observe the formation of a CEI layer that passivates the NNB electrolyte up to 5V, while the electrolyte is stable without needing additional passivation down to potentials as low as 1.5V. The onset potentials of the CEI formation reactions agree with those predicted by DFT2 and suggest that the resulting CEI is composed of closo-borohydrates, which are a type of metal borohydride with a cage-like structure that holds promise for high sodium ion conductivities3. XPS measurements of atomic compositions in the CEI layer show the formation of these closo-borohydrates and, coupled with charge transfer calculations, predict that the passivating CEI layer is thin (tens of nm). Impedance spectroscopy is performed to characterize the contribution of the CEI layer to the total cell resistance. Several formation cycling methods are explored to show that with appropriate cycling, the passivating layers contribute <10% to electrolyte resistance in the test cells.\n \n Acknowledgements: This work was supported as part of the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research, an Energy Innovation Hub funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences.\n \n References\n \n [1] Tushar Swamy, Xinwei Chen, and Yet-Ming Chiang, “Electrochemical Redox Behavior of Li-ion Conducting Sulfide Solid Electrolytes,” Chem.

        "abstract": "P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 (P2-NiMn) is one of the promising positive electrode materials for high-energy Na-ion batteries because of large reversible capacity and high working voltage by charging up to 4.5 V versus Na+/Na. However, the capacity rapidly decays during charge/discharge cycles, which is caused by the large volume shrinkage of ca. 23% by sodium deintercalation and following electric isolation of P2-NiMn particles in the composite electrode. Serious electrolyte decomposition at the higher voltage region than 4.1 V also brings deterioration of the particle surface and capacity decay during cycles. To solve these drawbacks, we apply water-soluble sodium poly-γ-glutamate (PGluNa) as an efficient binder to P2-NiMn instead of conventional poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVdF) and examined the electrode performances of P2-NiMn composite electrode with PGluNa binder for the first time. The PGluNa electrode shows Coulombic efficiency of 95% at the first cycle and capacity retention of 89% after 50 cycles, whereas the PVdF electrode exhibits only 80 and 71%, respectively. The alternating current impedance measurements reveal that the PGluNa electrode shows a much lower resistance during the cycles compared with the PVdF one. From the surface analysis and peeling test of the electrodes, the PGluNa binder was found to cover the surface of the P2-NiMn particles and suppresses the electrolyte decomposition and surface degradation. The PGluNa binder further enhance the mechanical strength of the electrodes and suppresses the electrical isolation of the P2-NiMn particles during sodium extraction/insertion. The efficient binder with noticeable adhesion strength and surface coverage of active materials and carbon has paved a new way to enhance the electrochemical performances of high-voltage positive electrode materials for Na-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The use of porous hard carbons (PHCs) as electrode materials in sodium-ion batteries has great potential; however, the exposure of large surface areas to electrolyte flow results in irregular and irreversible solid electrolyte interfaces (SEIs), leading to deteriorated ionic and electronic mobility and inferior initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). These issues can be addressed through suitable structural modifications of PHC materials. Herein, the integration of high-surface-area PHCs with carbon nanofibers (CNFs) was accomplished by a simple electrospinning technique, which resulted in a uniform and reversible SEI layer. In the meantime, the CNFs' mesh provided connectivity and conductivity in the as-integrated electrodes, whereas PHCs offered fast diffusion kinetics and high Na+ ion storage capacity. Additionally, PHC integration with CNFs demonstrated an excellent ICE of 77% and a specific capacity of 505 mAh/g at 25 mA/g. Furthermore, the conjugated microstructure also provided flexibility and stability to the electrode (260 mAh/g after 500 cycles). This remarkable synergy may promote the development of free-standing, flexible, and highly porous properties in a single material for advanced energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon, characterized by high ion storage capacity, low operating voltage, and excellent cycling stability, is considered an ideal negative electrode material for sodium‐ion batteries. However, the high cost and low carbon yield of thermosetting precursors limit their practical application in SIBs, while low‐cost and high‐yield raw materials exhibit highly ordered carbon structures and narrow interlayer spacing under high‐temperature carbonization. Discarded polyimide materials are inexpensive, which offer a high carbon yield and possess good thermal stability and thermoplasticity, with functional groups of imide rings (−CO−N−CO−) on their main chains. This study recycled and converted polyimide materials into hard carbon materials from discarded engineering plastics, investigating the influence of carbonization temperature on the degree of graphitization, interlayer spacing, and pore structure of the materials to achieve high reversible sodium storage capacity. After carbonization at 1300 °C, the polyimide material exhibited 319 mAh g−1 reversible capacity and excellent electrochemical performance (with a capacity retention of 91.92 % after 100 cycles at a 0.5 C current rate) and rate performance (up to 242.5 mAh g−1 at 2 C).

It is discovered that Mo2AlB2 shows a higher specific capacity than MoAlB when used as an electrode material for LIBs, with a specific capacity of 593 mAh g−1 achieved after 500 cycles at 200 mA g−1. It is also found that surface redox reactions are responsible for Li storage in Mo2AlB2, instead of intercalation or conversion. Moreover, the sodium hydroxide treatment of MoAlB leads to a porous morphology and higher specific capacities exceeding that of pristine MoAlB. When tested in SIBs, Mo2AlB2 exhibits a specific capacity of 150 mAh g−1 at 20 mA g−1.

However, works involving TMD materials as electrodes for sodium- (NIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) are relatively few, mainly due to poor electrode performance arising from significant volume changes and pulverization by the larger size alkali-metal ions. Here, we show that Na+ and K+ cyclability in WS2 TMD is improved by introducing WS2 nanosheets in a chemically and mechanically robust matrix comprising precursor-derived ceramic (PDC) silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) material. The WS2/SiOC composite in fibermat morphology was achieved via electrospinning followed by thermolysis of a polymer solution consisting of a polysiloxane (precursor to SiOC) dispersed with exfoliated WS2 nanosheets. The composite electrode was successfully tested in Na-ion and K-ion half-cells as a working electrode, which rendered the first cycle charge capacity of 474.88 mAh g−1 and 218.91 mAh g−1, respectively. The synergistic effect of the composite electrode leads to higher capacity and improved coulombic efficiency compared to the neat WS2 and neat SiOC materials in these cells.",

Two types of compositions are examined where diamagnetic Co3+ and paramagnetic Ni3+ and Mn4+ are stabilized: Na2/3Co1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2 and Na1/2Ni1/2Mn1/2O2. EPR spectroscopy operating in the X- and Q-band region is applied with an aim to improve the spectra resolution and, on the other hand, to provide straightforward information on the coordination of the transition metal ions inside the layers. The analysis of EPR spectra is based on the reference for the Mn4+ and Ni2+ ions occurring simultaneously in oxides with two layer stacking, P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2. Complementary to EPR, 23Na MAS NMR spectroscopy at high spinning rates is undertaken to assess the local structure of the Na nucleus in the layered P3-NayCo1-2xNixMnxO2 oxides. All results are discussed taking into account the EPR and NMR data for the well-known lithium analogues O3-LiCo1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2 and O3-LiNi1/2Mn1/2O2.

However, the relatively low volumetric density and high fragile structure are the obstacles blocking the development of hollow-structured electrode materials. In this work, ball-in-ball structured (Ni0.33Co0.67)9S8@C nanospheres have been synthesized by using NiCo-glycerate as the precursor via solvothermal reaction, which was followed by a carbon coating treatment. In this structural design, hollow cavities are generated between the inner and outer balls to effectively accommodate the volume changes of the metal sulfides in the processes of charging/discharging, while the uniform carbon coating can increase the electrical conductivity and maintain the structural stability during repeated cycling. The Rietveld refinement, in situ X-ray diffraction, and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses provide evidence for an enlarged lattice parameter, weaker Co-S and Ni-S bonding, and a synergistic effect in the (Ni0.33Co0.67)9S8@C towards boosting the conversion reaction and reversible formation of sulfur in the fully charged state, with the sulfur trapped within the composite to additionally account for the superior cycling stability of this material. Capacitive behavior has been verified to dominate the electrochemical reaction, enabling fast charge transport kinetics.

        "abstract": "The revolution in lithium-ion battery (LIB) technology was partly due to the invention of graphite as a robust negative electrode material. However, equivalent negative electrode materials for complementary sodium ion battery (NIB) technologies are yet to be commercialized due to sluggish reaction kinetics, phase instability, and low energy density originating from the larger size of Na+-ion. Therefore, in search of the next-generation electrode materials for NIBs, we first analyze the failure of graphite during reversible Na+ ion storage. Building upon that, we suggest surface-functionalized and nanostructured forms of analogous carbon allotropes for enhancing Na+ ion storage. During long-term rigorous cycling conditions, Graphene Oxide (GO) and Graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) exhibit higher Na+ ion storage (157 mAh g−1 and 50 mAh g−1 after 60 cycles, respectively) compared to graphite (27 mAh g−1). Optimizing alternative NIBs requires a comprehensive analysis of cycling behavior and kinetic information. Therefore, in this investigation, we further examine ex-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at progressive cycles and correlate capacity degradation with impedance arising from the electrolyte, solid electrolyte interphase formation, and charge transfer.",

In this work, a NaTi2(PO4)3/C (NTP/C) nanocomposite with an open holey-structured framework was successfully prepared for the first time using a solvothermal reaction followed by pyrolysis. The nanocomposite realized fast sodium-ion transport and thus preferable battery performances. Within the wide rate range of 0.5-50C, only a very small decrease in capacity from 124 to 120 mA h g-1 was observed. A high discharge capacity of 103 mA h g-1 (88.3% retention of the 1st cycle) was delivered even after 10 000 cycles at an ultrahigh rate of 50C without any obvious morphological change and without structural pulverization. Forming open channels for ion transport proved to contribute to such performance enhancement and therefore has the potential to become a universal model for the development of sustainable electrode materials in SIBs and other battery systems.",

        "abstract": "The rate performance, power density, and energy efficiency of electrochemical devices are often limited by ionic conductivities in electrolyte and electrode materials. Framework Prussian blue analogs and dense niobium oxides have been identified as high-rate electrodes for sodium- and lithium-ion batteries, respectively, yet the origin of the extremely high solid-state Na+/Li+ transport is not fully understood. Of critical importance is the fact that their ultra-low activation energy and anomalous pre-exponent factor cannot be satisfactorily rationalized from conventional theory of solid-state diffusion in the crystal lattice. Here, assisted by density-functional-theory calculations, we argued that the true origin is a unique surface-like diffusion mechanism of the intercalation ions. In a surface-like migration event, a mobile ion moves along the channel wall via a low coordination number and low migration barrier experiencing minimal steric hindrance. It is similar to surface diffusion in the conventional picture and contrasts with lattice diffusion from one interstitial/vacancy site to another one with high coordination number, crowded saddle-point geometry and high migration barrier. The analogy to gas diffusion in molecular sieves shall be discussed. Additionally, the effects of defects and crystal water in Prussian blue analogs were also discussed for better understanding their rate performances in experimental scenarios.",

        "abstract": "The development of hard carbon (HC) electrodes using biobased binders, formulated in water solvent, is of great interest for Na-ion batteries. Five Na-carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binders with different molecular weights and degrees of substitution were investigated. The increase in the CMC molecular weight led to an increase in the volume of water necessary for slurry preparation and a decrease in the electrode mass loading. Moreover, the adhesion of the slurry was strongly impacted by the aluminum current collector properties. A high initial Coulombic efficiency, iCE (up to ∼90%), and reversible capacity (up to 334 mAh g-1 at C/10) were obtained in Na half-cells. Post-mortem XPS analyses performed on several electrodes under various conditions allowed a better understanding of the formation and composition of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. The genesis of SEI was initially chemically driven: to a small extent, by HC and to a greater extent, by the Na metal. However, SEI formation was mainly governed by the electrochemical-driven degradation of the electrolyte salt and solvent. The SEI layer composed of an inorganic-rich core and an organic-rich shell significantly decreased the resistance of the HC electrode, allowing superior iCE while maintaining high capacity retention (96.2%), after 100 cycles at 1C.",

        "abstract": "Na-ion batteries are one of the best technologies for large-scale applications depending on almost infinite and widespread sodium resources. However, the state-of-the-art separators cannot meet the engineering needs of large-scale sodium-ion batteries to match the intensively investigated electrode materials. Here, a kind of flexible modified cellulose acetate separator (MCA) for sodium-ion batteries was synthesized via the electrospinning process and subsequently optimizing the interface chemical groups by changing acetyl to hydroxyl partly. Upon the rational design, the flexible MCA separator exhibits high chemical stability and excellent wettability (contact angles nearly 0°) in electrolytes (EC/PC, EC/DMC, diglyme, and triglyme). Moreover, the flexible MCA separator shows high onset temperature of degradation (over 250 °C) and excellent thermal stability (no shrinkage at 220 °C). Electrochemical measurements, importantly, show that the Na-ion batteries with flexible MCA separator exhibit ultralong cycle life (93.78%, 10 000 cycles) and high rate capacity (100.1 mAh g-1 at 10 C) in the Na/Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) half cell (2.5-4.0 V) and good cycle performance (98.59%, 100 cycles) in the Na/SnS2 half cell (0.01-3 V), respectively. Moreover, the full cell (SnS2/NVP) with flexible MCA separator displays the capacity of 98 mAh g-1 and almost no reduction after 40 cycles at 0.118 A g-1. Thus, this work provides a kind of flexible modified cellulose acetate separator for Na-ion batteries with great potential for practical large-scale applications.",

Herein, we reported a mechanism study of graphene-supported oxygen-deficient anatase TiO2 nanotubes (nanowires) as the negative electrode material for sodium ion batteries. Different from the previous reports, the insertion/extraction of Na+ ions leads to almost no changes of titanium valence state but there is a charge redistribution of O 2p orbitals which alters the hybridization between O 2p and Ti 3d states, suggested by the combined electrochemical and X-ray spectroscopic study. Both the electronic and local structures of TiO2 during the reversible sodiation/desodiation process are revealed from the Ti L-edge and O K-edge spectra. This detailed study would shed light on the material design and structural optimization of TiO2 as energy storage material in different systems.",

        "abstract": "FeS2 is a promising electrode material for alkali metal ion storage due to its high theoretical capacity. However, it still faces critical issues such as suboptimal rate and cycling performances owing to sluggish charge transport and significant volume variations. Herein, we constructed FeS2 (m-FeS2) and pyrite FeS2 (p-FeS2) nanocomposites embedded in N,S-doped carbon nanoboxes (m/p-FeS2@NSCN) to conquer such challenges. The microstructure design of nanoboxes effectively alleviates the stress caused by the volume expansion of FeS2 during lithiation processes, thereby improving the cycling stability of the FeS2 electrode. The marcasite/pyrite compositing design further increases the electronic conductivity of FeS2 and optimizes ion migration. As expected, the target m/p-FeS2@NSCN exhibits improved rate capability (595.5 mA h g-1 at 5.0 A g-1) and robust cycling stability (500 cycles without significant capacity decay at 0.1 A g-1) in lithium-ion batteries. Furthermore, m/p-FeS2@NSCN also shows excellent battery performances and potential application prospects in the field of sodium-ion batteries. It achieves a capacity of 355 mA h g-1 at 10.0 A g-1 and sustains 800 cycles without noticeable capacity decay at 0.5 A g-1.

        "abstract": "Technological advancement has been revolutionized by rechargeable batteries, without which the use of various modern devices would not be possible. Aqueous Na ion batteries have lately garnered much attention, being recognized as a promising alternative to the commonly used Li ion batteries for the large-scale energy storage systems. However, further improvement and optimization of such systems require a more detailed understanding of intercalation mechanisms. In this work, we for the first time demonstrate the implementation of the laser-induced current transient (LICT) technique for in situ characterization of battery systems and investigate the interface between Na2Ni[Fe(CN)6] model battery electrodes and aqueous electrolytes in contact with aqueous electrolytes. Quite counterintuitively, the LICT method revealed that at the quasi-steady-state the electrode surface stays positively charged within the potential range where the intercalation/deintercalation of sodium as well as of potassium is possible, evidencing that the intercalation mechanism of the alkali-metal cations should be rather complex. Furthermore, the specific shape of the observed current transients indicates that the interfacial processes of intercalation/deintercalation have at least three different relaxation time constants. The relaxation behavior is highly influenced by the nature of the alkali-metal cations-most likely through their different solvation energy. In addition, we outline how the laser-based experiments can intensify detailed in situ investigations of battery systems.",

        "abstract": "In the pursuit of reliable energy storage solutions, the significance of engineering electrodes cannot be overstated. Previous research has explored the use of surface modifiers (SMs), such as single-side fluorinated graphene, to enhance the thermodynamic stability of ion intercalation when applied atop few-layer graphene (FLG). As we seek alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), earth-abundant elements like sodium and potassium have emerged as promising candidates. However, a comprehensive investigation into staging intercalation has been lacking thus far. By delving into staging assemblies, we have uncovered a previously unknown intercalation site that offers the most energetically favorable binding. Here, we study the first three elements in both alkali (Li, Na, K) and alkaline (Be, Mg, Ca) earth metals. Furthermore, the precise mechanism underlying this intercalation system has remained elusive in prior studies. In our work, we employed density functional theory calculations with advanced hybrid functionals to determine the electrical properties at various stages of intercalation. This approach has been proven to yield more accurate and reliable electrical information. Through the analysis of projecting density of states and Mulliken population, we have gained valuable insights into the intricate interactions among the SM, ions, and FLG as the ions progressively insert into the structures. Notably, we expanded our investigation beyond lithium and explored the effectiveness of the SM on ions with varying radii and valence, encompassing six alkali and alkaline earth metals. Additionally, we discovered that the number of graphene layers significantly influences the binding energy. Our findings present groundbreaking concepts for material design, offering diverse and economically viable alternatives to LIBs. Furthermore, they serve as a valuable reference for fine-tuning electrical properties through staging intercalation and the application of SMs.",

However, it is still trapped seriously by the inborn bottleneck of low‐softening‐point (LSP) characteristics of CP itself. Herein, an efficient Bi(NO3)3·5H2O‐assisted electrospinning‐carbonization methodology is creatively devised to obtain flexible HCNFs films directly from LSP CP. The essential roles of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and pre‐oxidation in constructing flexible films are rationally proposed. With further regulation in Bi(NO3)3·5H2O dosage and calcination temperatures, specific micro‐structures/morphologies of flexible HCNFs films are finely optimized. The optimum HCNFs‐1.2 film is endowed with robust structural flexibility/stability, high‐content active oxygen/nitrogen groups, abundant graphic microcrystalline zones of large interlayer spacing, and convenient ion‐diffusion channels. Thanks to such remarkable merits, HCNFs‐1.2 retains a large reversible capacity of 125.3 mAh g‒1 over 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g‒1, when evaluated as a self‐supporting film anode for sodium dual‐ion batteries (SDIBs). Furthermore, the HCNFs‐1.2‐based SDIBs deliver a specific capacity of 90.9 mAh g‒1 at 0.1 A g‒1, along with a capacity retention of 78.4% after 1500 cycles at 1.0 A g‒1.

These two hybrids synthesized by facile methods are fully characterized, and the results reveal that their energy-storage properties can be significantly improved by enhancing the electrical conductivity via the formation of a well-overlapped structure between CONs and GNs. The discharge capacity and rate capability of the reflux-synthesized hybrid was considerably larger than that of the bare CONs, highlighting that the improvement in the charge-carrier transport properties can improve the accessibility of Na ions to the surface of the hybrids.

        "abstract": "Alloy-based nanostructure anodes have the privilege of alleviating the challenges of large volume expansion and improving the cycling stability and rate performance for high energy lithium- and sodium-ion batteries (LIBs and SIBs). Yet, they face the dilemma of worsening the parasitic reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface and low packing density for the fabrication of practical electrodes. Here, pomegranate Sb@C yolk-shell microspheres were developed as a high-performance anode for LIBs and SIBs with controlled interfacial properties and enhanced packing density. Although the same yolk-shell nanostructure (primary particle size, porosity) and three-dimensional architecture alleviated the volume change induced stress and swelling in both batteries, the SIBs show 99% capacity retention over 200 cycles, much better than the 78% capacity retention of the LIBs. The comparative electrochemical study and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterization revealed that the different SEIs, besides the distinct phase transition mechanism, played a critical role in the divergent cycling performance.",

        "abstract": "The composite gel electrolyte (CGE), which combines the advantages of inorganic solid-state electrolytes and solid polymer electrolytes, is regarded as the ultimate candidate for constructing batteries with high safety and superior electrode-electrolyte interface contact. However, the ubiquitous agglomeration of nanofillers results in low filler utilization, which seriously reduces structural uniformity and ion transport efficiency, thus restricting the development of consistent and durable batteries. Herein, a solution-processable method to in situ construct CGE with high filler utilization is introduced. The homogeneous metal-organic framework fillers contribute to uniform ionic and electronic filed distribution, realizing a stable electrode-electrolyte interface. Consequently, the CGE with high filler utilization achieves an ultra-long lifespan of 10 000 cycles with a capacity retention of 80.2%. This work provides guidance for constructing high-performance CGEs in electrochemical energy-storage devices.",

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenide materials show potential for use in alkali metal ion batteries owing to their remarkable physical and chemical properties. Nevertheless, the electrochemical energy storage performance is still impaired by the tendency of aggregation, volume, and morphological change during the conversion reaction and poor intrinsic conductivity. Until now, ultrathin molybdenum disulfide nanosheets with a metallic-phase structure on the inner surface of mesoporous hollow carbon spheres (M-MoS2@HCS) have rarely been investigated as an anode for sodium-ion batteries. In this work, a novel M-MoS2@HCS anode was designed and synthesized by employing a template-assisted solvothermal reaction. Structural and chemical analyses indicate that the M-MoS2 nanosheets with a larger interlayer spacing compared to their semiconductor counterpart grow on the inner surface of HCS via covalent interactions. When used as the anode materials for Na+ storage, the M-MoS2@HCS anode presents durable and rapid sodium storage properties. The developed electrode shows a reversible capacity of 291.2 mAh g-1 at a high current density of 5 A g-1. After 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1, the reversible capacity is 401.3 mAh g-1 with a capacity retention rate of 79%. After 2500 cycles at 1.0 A g-1, the electrode still delivers a reversible capacity of 320.1 mAh g-1 with a capacity retention rate of 75%. The excellent sodium storage capability of the MoS2@HCS electrode is explained by the special structural design, which reveals great potential to accelerate the practical applications of transition-metal dichalcogenide electrodes for sodium storage.",

        "abstract": "In this work, the ability to print shape-conformable batteries with multi-process additive manufacturing is reported. Vat photopolymerization (VPP) 3D printing process is employed to manufacture gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), while direct ink writing process is used to prepare positive electrodes. The sodium-ion chemistry has proven to be an adequate substitute to lithium-ion due to the availability of resources and their potential lower production cost and enhanced safety. Three-dimensional printing technologies have the potential to revolutionize the production of shape-conformable batteries with intricate geometries that have been demonstrated to increase the specific surface area of the electrode and ion diffusion, thus leading to improved power performances. This study shows the preparation of composite UV-photocurable resins with different polymer matrix-to-liquid electrolyte ratios, designed to act as GPEs once printed via VPP. The impact of the liquid electrolyte ratio within the GPEs is thoroughly examined through a variety of electrochemical techniques. The exposure time printing parameter is optimized to ensure adequate print accuracy of the GPE. Using the optimized resin composition as material feedstock, shape-conformable 3D printed GPE exhibiting an ionic conductivity of 3.3 × 10−3 S·cm−1 at room temperature and a stability window up to 4.8 V vs. Na0/Na+ is obtained. In parallel, a composite ink loaded with Na0.44MnO2 and conductive additives is developed to 3D print via direct ink writing positive electrodes. After demonstrating the functionality of the independent 3D printed components in SIBs, the last part of this work is focused on combining the 3D printed Na0.44MnO2 electrode and the 3D printed GPE into the same battery cell to pave the way towards the manufacturing of a complete 3D printed battery thanks to different additive manufacturing processes.",

Defect engineering, such as single-heteroatom doping and oxygen vacancies, has proven to be effective methods to improve the conductivity of TiO2, but a comprehensive understanding of the synergistic effect of dual-heteroatom doping and oxygen vacancies on the sodium storage performance of TiO2 is still lacking. Herein, we design a synergistic strategy of dual doping via the in situ doping and hydrogenation treatment to improve conductivity and cycling stability of TiO2. Experiments and theoretical calculations together revealed that N and C doping reduces the band gap of TiO2, while the presence of oxygen vacancies efficiently accelerates the diffusion of sodium ions. Thus N, C, and oxygen vacancies with high concentration co-doped TiO2, resulting in extraordinary high-rate performance, significant stable cycling, and long-term cyclability of up to 10,000 cycles. The synthesis strategy of dual doping proposed here emphasizes the importance of defect engineering in improving material conductivity and electrode cycling stability for possible practical applications in the near future.",

As the anode of LIBs, CoP‐C@MoS2/C exhibits outstanding long‐cycle performance of 369 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1 after 2000 cycles.

Both crystallize in monoclinic (P21/n) symmetry, but HE‐PBA‐1, with Cu, exhibits a lower bandgap, lower Na‐ion diffusion barrier, higher [Fe(CN)6] vacancy, and smaller particle size compared to HE‐PBA‐2 with Zn. These factors result in higher power capability for HE‐PBA‐1 due to its enhanced electronic conductivity and Na‐ion diffusivity. Additionally, its higher [Fe(CN)6] vacancy and smaller particle size offer more electrochemical active sites, improving energy characteristics. A Na‐ion full cell with HE‐PBA‐1 as the positive electrode and a mixed‐metallic sodium–copper–iron oxide (NaCuFe‐Oxide) as the negative electrode in a hydrogel electrolyte is assembled. It achieves a specific capacity of 94 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1, an energy density of 70 Wh kg−1 at 74 W kg−1, a power density of 375 W kg−1 at 57 Wh kg−1, and excellent durability with 89% capacity retention over 500 cycles at 200 mA g−1 within a 0–2 V window.

Here we study orthorhombic tungsten ditelluride or Td-WTe2 as an electrode material for sodium- (SIB) and potassium-ion batteries (KIB) in propylene carbonate (PC) based electrolyte. Results show that despite larger Shannon’s radius of potassium-ions and their sluggish diffusion in Td-WTe2 due to higher overpotential, at 100 mA.g−1 KIB-half cells showed higher cycling stability and low capacity decay of 4% versus 16% compared to SIB-half cells. Likewise, in a rate capability test at 61st cycle (at 50 mA.g−1), the KIB-half cells yielded charge capacity of 172 mAh.g−1 versus 137 mAh.g−1 of SIB-half cells. The superior electrochemical performance of Td-WTe2 electrode material in KIB-half cells is explained based on the concept of Stokes’ radius—smaller desolvation activation energy resulted in higher mobility of potassium-ions in PC-based electrolyte. In addition, the likely mechanisms of electrochemical insertion and extraction of Na- and K-ions in Td-WTe2 are also discussed.",

Herein, a universal method is reported for making hierarchical hollow carbon nanospheres (HCSs) with intimately coupled ultrathin carbon nanosheets and Mo‐based nanocrystals.

As a proof of concept, the as‐prepared MoP/C HCSs exhibit extraordinary hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalytic activity with small overpotential and robust durability in both acidic and alkaline solutions. In addition, the unique sheet‐on‐sheet MoS2/C HCSs as an anode demonstrate high capacity, great rate capabilities, and long‐term cycles for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). The capacity can be maintained at 410 mA h g−1 even after 1000 cycles even at a high current density of 4 A g−1, one of the best reported values for MoS2‐based electrode materials for SIBs.

To this end, the electronic properties, adsorption energy, diffusion energy barrier, open‐circuit voltage (OCV), and theoretical capacity are evaluated. The density of states calculations indicate that BPNT and BBPNT with zero band gap have a metallic character, which is critical for electron transferring in electrode materials. The calculation of adsorption energies suggests that the inside of the tube has better adsorption than the outside. Also, doping with boron improves the adsorption inside and outside the nanotube. Sodium ion sees three ways to penetrate from the outside to the inside of the tube. Calculations illustrate that the bigger ring with eight atoms with a 7.08 eV energy barrier, compared to the other cavities, is more appropriate for diffusion. This energy decreases to 5.84 eV after boron doping. The OCV profile of BBPNT confirms that this structure is in the acceptable voltage range for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Finally, this work obtains a theoretical capacity of 403.82 mAh g−1 (without sodium clustering) for BBPNT, which confirms the potential of this structure for use in SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Low utilization of active metallic sodium (Na) and uncontrollable growth of Na dendrites remain significant challenges for high-performance Na metal batteries, which are limited to inefficient Na-utilization (<1%) and shallow cycling conditions (0.25-1.0 mAh cm-2). In this work, a kind of Na metal anode with record-high utilization and long-term cycling stability is reported, using carbon substrate-supported nitrogen-anchored zinc (Zn) single atoms as current collector. Single Zn atom sites serve as a strong \"magnet\" for Na ions, which guide the metallic Na uniform nucleation and free from dendrite-induced short circuit. The nucleation overpotential of our strategy is essentially zero, where most of the reported modified substrates are greatly exceed 20 mV. Specifically, the Na anodes exhibit a high Na stripping/plating Coulombic efficiency with 99.8% over 350 cycles and a stable voltage response with small voltage hysteresis after cycling 1000 h. The full cell exhibits high Na-utilization up to 100% and superior long-term cycling stability for more than 1000 cycles with excellent capacity retention. In terms of both lifetime and Na-utilization, our strategy are significantly outperforms the reported state-of-the-art Na metal anodes. Moreover, this affords new insights into the controllable Na nucleation behavior and high Na utilization, and sheds a fresh light on atomic level design of electrode for Na metal anodes.",

Our model is applied to understand the effects of crystal water on sodium ion intercalation in a tunnel manganese oxide structure, and we predict that precisely controlling the crystal water concentration can optimize the ion intercalation voltage and capacity and promote stable cycling. The analysis yields a critical structural water concentration by accounting for the interplay between elastic and electrostatic contributions to the free energy.

        "abstract": "The pseudo‐layered sulfide NiCr2S4 exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance as anode material in sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). The Na storage mechanism is investigated by synchrotron‐based X‐ray scattering and absorption techniques as well as by electrochemical measurements. A very high reversible capacity in the 500th cycle of 489 mAh g−1 is observed at 2.0 A g−1 in the potential window 3.0–0.1 V. Full discharge includes irreversible generation of Ni0 and Cr0 nanoparticles embedded in nanocrystalline Na2S yielding shortened diffusion lengths and predominantly surface‐controlled charge storage. During charge, Ni0 and Cr0 are oxidized, Na2S is consumed, and amorphous Ni and Cr sulfides are formed. Limiting the potential window to 3.0–0.3 V an unusual nickel extrusion sodium insertion mechanism occurs: Ni2+ is reduced to nanosized Ni0 domains, expelled from the host lattice, and is replaced by Na+ cations to form O3‐type like NaCrS2. Surprisingly, the discharge and charge processes comprise Na+ shuttling between highly crystalline NiCr2S4 and NaCrS2 enabling a superior long‐term stability for 3000 cycles. The results not only provide valuable insights for the electrochemistry of conversion materials but also extend the scope of layered electrode materials considering the reversible nickel extrusion sodium insertion reaction as new concept for SIBs.",

Analysis of the spectra shows the occupation of the initially empty orbitals of MoS2 by sodium electrons as a result of the interaction of the components of the sodium‐ion half‐cell. Ex situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of a fully discharged electrode material reveal partial transformation of hexagonal MoS2 to disordered tetragonal MoS2 coated with a surface electrolyte interphase layer.

        "title": "Stable Structure and Fast Ion Diffusion: A Flexible MoO2@Carbon Hollow Nanofiber Film as a Binder-Free Anode for Sodium-Ion Batteries with Superior Kinetics and Excellent Rate Capability",
        "abstract": "Designing innovative anode materials that exhibit excellent ion diffusion kinetics, enhanced structural stability, and superior electrical conductivity is imperative for advancing the rapid charge–discharge performance and widespread application of sodium-ion batteries. Hollow-structured materials have received significant attention in electrode design due to their rapid ion diffusion kinetics. Building upon this, we present a high-performance, free-standing MoO2@hollow carbon nanofiber (MoO2@HCNF) electrode, fabricated through facile coaxial electrospinning and subsequent heat treatment. In comparison to MoO2@carbon nanofibers (MoO2@CNFs), the MoO2@HCNF electrode demonstrates superior rate capability, attributed to its larger specific surface area, its higher pseudocapacitance contribution, and the enhanced diffusion kinetics of sodium ions. The discharge capacities of the MoO2@HCNF (MoO2@CNF) electrode at current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 A g−1 are 195.55 (155.49), 180.98 (135.20), 163.81 (109.71), 144.05 (90.46), 121.16 (71.21) and 88.90 (44.68) mAh g−1, respectively. Additionally, the diffusion coefficients of sodium ions in the MoO2@HCNFs are 8.74 × 10−12 to 1.37 × 10−12 cm2 s−1, which surpass those of the MoO2@CNFs (6.49 × 10−12 to 9.30 × 10−13 cm2 s−1) during the discharging process. In addition, these prepared electrode materials exhibit outstanding flexibility, which is crucial to the power storage industry and smart wearable devices.",

        "title": "Composition and Structure of the solid electrolyte interphase on Na-Ion Anodes Revealed by Exo- and Endogenous Dynamic Nuclear Polarization—NMR Spectroscopy",
        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (SIB) are among the most promising devices for large scale energy storage. Their stable and long-term performance depends on the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), a nanosized, heterogeneous and disordered layer, formed due to degradation of the electrolyte at the anode surface. The chemical and structural properties of the SEI control the charge transfer process at the electrode–electrolyte interface, thus, there is great interest in determining these properties for understanding, and ultimately controlling, SEI functionality. However, the study of the SEI is notoriously challenging due to its heterogeneous nature and minute quantity. In this work, we present a powerful approach for probing the SEI based on solid state NMR spectroscopy with increased sensitivity from dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). Utilizing exogenous (organic radicals) and endogenous (paramagnetic metal ion dopants) DNP sources, we obtain not only a detailed compositional map of the SEI but also, for the first time for the native SEI, determine the spatial distribution of its constituent phases. Using this approach, we perform a thorough investigation of the SEI formed on Li4Ti5O12 used as a SIB anode. We identify a compositional gradient, from organic phases at the electrolyte interface to inorganic phases toward the anode surface. We find that the use of fluoroethylene carbonate as an electrolyte additive leads to performance degradation which can be attributed to formation of a thicker SEI, rich in NaF and carbonates. We expect that this methodology can be extended to examine other titanate anodes and new electrolyte compositions, offering a unique tool for SEI investigations to enable the development of effective and long-lasting SIBs.",

In this respect, perylene‐3,4,9,10‐tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) is a promising anode active material, but it suffers from extensive dissolution in conventional aqueous electrolytes. As a remedy, we here present a novel aqueous electrolyte, which inhibits the PTCDA dissolution and enables their use as all‐organic ASIB anodes with high capacity retention and Coulombic efficiencies. Furthermore, the electrolyte is based on two, hence “hybrid”, inexpensive and non‐fluorinated Na/Mg‐salts, it displays favourable physico‐chemical properties and an electrochemical stability window >3 V without resorting to the extreme salt concentrations of water‐in‐salt electrolytes. Altogether, this paves the way for ASIBs with both relatively high energy densities, inexpensive total cell chemistries, long‐term sustainability, and improved safety.",

To overcome these drawbacks, liquid-phase exfoliated graphene (LEGr) was used as the support, for which MoS2@LEGr heterostructures with a tunable loading amount of MoS2 were fabricated by a microwave-assisted solvothermal method. LEGr with its exceptional atomic structure not only serves as a robust structural support of MoS2 but also provides rapid electrical and ionic transfer pathways of the electrode material.

        "abstract": "Iron sulfide (FeS) has been extensively studied as sodium‐ion battery anodes due to its high theoretical capacity (609 mAh g−1), but its large volume expansion and low electrical conductivity result in unsatisfactory cycling life and poor rate performance. Moreover, the sodium ion storage mechanism of FeS at a voltage range of 0.01–1 V involving conversion reactions and subsequent ion storage process is unclear yet. Here, the study proposes a vapor‐pressure induced synthesis route to fabricate FeS/C yolk‐shell structure that ultrathin carbon layers coat on the surface of FeS nanosheets, which can accommodate volume expansion of FeS during sodiation observed via in situ transmission electron microscope and improve its electrical conductivity. Remarkably, an in situ magnetometry reveals that vast spin‐polarized electrons can be injected into superparamagnetic Fe nanoparticles (≈3 nm) formed during conversion reaction to induce evolution of electrode magnetization between 0.01 and 1 V, during which spin‐polarized surface capacitance effect occurs at Fe/Na2S interfaces to increase extra ion storage and boost ion transport stably. Consequently, the FeS/C yolk‐shell nanosheets deliver a high reversible capacity of 664.9 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, and 300.4 mAh g−1 after 10 000 cycles at 10 A g−1 with a capacity retention of 81.1%.",

However, the lack of advanced electrode materials greatly affects their applications. Here, layered-structure SbPO4 is explored as an anode material for sodium ion batteries in terms of SbPO4 nanorods on reduced graphene oxide (SbPO4/rGO). In situ transmission electron microscopy images reveal the preferential expansion along the transverse direction of the nanorods upon the first discharging, which arises from the reduction of SbPO4 to Sb and the subsequent alloying of Sb as supported by in situ X-ray diffraction and selected area electron diffraction patterns. SbPO4/rGO exhibits a capacity retention of 99% after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g-1 both in half cells and in full cells. Its specific capacity at 5 A g-1 is 214 mA h g-1 in half cells or 134 mA h g-1 in full cells.

        "abstract": "Owing to their high theoretical capacity, transition-metal oxides have received a considerable amount of attention as potential anode materials in sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries. Among them, Mn3O4 has gained interest due to the low cost of raw materials and the environmental compatibility. However, during the insertion/de-insertion process, Mn3O4 suffers from particle aggregation, poor conductivity, and low-rate capability, which, in turn, limits its practical application. To overcome these obstacles, we have successfully prepared Mn3O4 nanoparticles distributed on the nitrogen (N)-doped and nitrogen, sulphur (N,S)-doped reduced graphene oxide (rGO) aerogels, respectively. The highly crystalline Mn3O4 nanoparticles, with an average size of 15–20 nm, are homogeneously dispersed on both sides of the N-rGO and N,S-rGO aerogels. The results indicate that the N-rGO and N,S-rGO aerogels could provide an efficient ion transport channel for electrolyte ion stability in the Mn3O4 electrode. The Mn3O4/N- and Mn3O4/N,S-doped rGO aerogels exhibit outstanding electrochemical performances, with a reversible specific capacity of 374 and 281 mAh g−1, respectively, after 100 cycles, with Coulombic efficiency of almost 99%. The interconnected structure of heteroatom-doped rGO with Mn3O4 nanoparticles is believed to facilitate fast ion diffusion and electron transfer by lowering the energy barrier, which favours the complete utilisation of the active material and improvement of the structure’s stability.",

        "abstract": "In response to the increasing concern for energy management, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been extensively researched as an attractive anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The proficient cycling durability and good rate performance of SIBs are the two key parameters that determine their potential for practical use. In this study, nature-inspired three-dimensional (3D) MoS2 ultrathin marigold flower-like microstructures were prepared by a controlled hydrothermal method. These microscale flowers are constructed by arbitrarily arranged but closely interconnected two-dimensional ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets. The as-prepared MoS2 microflowers (MFs) have then been chemically wrapped by layered graphene sheets to form the bonded 3D hybrid MoS2-G networks. TEM, SEM, XRD, XPS, and Raman characterizations were used to study the morphology, crystallization, chemical compositions, and wrapping contact between MoS2 and graphene. The ultrathin nature of MoS2 in 3D MFs and graphene wrapping provide strong electrical conductive channels and conductive networks in an electrode. Benefitting from the 2 nm ultrathin crystalline MoS2 sheets, chemically bonded graphene, defect-induced sodium storage active sites, and 3D interstitial spaces, the prepared electrode exhibited an outstanding specific capacity (606 mA h g-1 at 200 mA g-1), remarkable rate performance (345 mA h g-1 at 1600 mA g-1), and long cycle life (over 100 cycles with tremendous Coulombic efficiencies beyond 100%).

Moreover, the kinetic behaviors were confirmed using CV profiles at various rates, as well as the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

Instead, SWBs utilize abundant sodium from seawater, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional battery technologies. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of achieving high energy densities in SWB anodes using vertically aligned electrodes. However, the use of tin anode materials with high volumetric energy density has encountered reversibility challenges due to the electrical isolation of tin particles caused by severe pulverization during charging and discharging. In this study, the reversibility of vertically arranged tin electrodes is improved by promoting desodiation of pulverized tin particles through the use of sodium-pyrene (Na-Pyr) as a redox mediator. The Na-Pyr redox-mediated electrolyte, combined with vertically aligned tin electrodes, demonstrates reversible capacities of 6 mAh cm-2 over 80 cycles in SWBs. Furthermore, it is shown that arranging the electrodes vertically to maximize the area can achieve a high areal capacity of up to 40 mAh cm-2. The combination of the Na-Pyr redox mediator and vertical tin electrode, with its excellent electrochemical performance, is promising as a practical anode material for enabling SWBs to achieve high energy density.",

        "abstract": "We conducted a thorough analysis to assess the suitability of a T-graphene-like BC2N monolayer as an electrode material for sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) using first-principles calculations. Our investigation demonstrates the chemical adsorption of Na/K atoms onto the BC2N monolayer, which exhibits metallic properties after Na/K adsorption, ensuring excellent electrode conductivity. The average open-circuit voltages for Na and K are 0.39–0.12 V and 0.87–0.14 V, respectively. Furthermore, the BC2N monolayer revealed significantly lower Na/K diffusion barriers (0.40 eV for Na and 0.22 eV for K) and higher storage capacities (1647 mAh g−1 for Na and 2196 mAh g−1 for K) compared to conventional two-dimensional anode materials. These exceptional characteristics highlight the promising potential of the T-graphene-like BC2N monolayer in advancing Na/K-ion batteries technology.",

Here, we exploit our expertise to control the deposition of a nm-sized conformal coating of carbon nitride with tunable thickness to improve the electrochemical performance of anode material derived from sodium lignosulfonate. In this way, we significantly enhanced the electrochemical performances of the electrode, such as the first cycle efficiency, rate-capability, and specific capacity. In particular, with a 10 nm homogeneous carbon nitride coating, the specific capacity is extended by more than 30% with respect to the bare carbon material with an extended plateau capacity, which we attribute to a heterojunction effect at the materials' interface.

        "abstract": "There is a crucial need for low-cost energy storage technology based on abundant sodium ions to realize sustainable development with renewable energy resources. Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) is applied as a binder in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, PVDF is also known to suffer from a larger irreversible capacity, especially when PVDF is used as the binder of negative electrode materials. In this research, a poly(acrylonitrile)-grafted poly(vinyl alcohol) copolymer (PVA-g-PAN) is tested as a binder with Ti-based layered oxides as potential negative electrode materials for SIBs. The chemical stability tests of PVDF and PVA-g-PAN contacted with metallic sodium have been conducted, which reveals that PVDF experiences a defluorination process, while PVA-g-PAN demonstrates excellent chemical stability. Composite electrodes with PVA-g-PAN demonstrate superior electrochemical performances when compared with the PVDF binder, allowing improvement for initial CE, higher rate capability, and long cyclability over 1500 cycles. Detailed characterization of electrodes via soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy demonstrates that the PVA-g-PAN branched structure allows a more uniform distribution of acetylene black with higher coatability, unlocking enhanced rate performances and efficient passivation of Ti-based oxides without the excessive electrolyte decomposition. These findings open a new way to design practical and durable sodium-ion batteries with a high-power density.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal oxides can be considered as appealing candidates for sodium ion battery anode materials because these low-cost materials possess high capacity and enhanced safety. However, the practical application of these materials is usually limited by their low electronic conductivity and serious volume change during the charging-discharging process. Herein, we report the fabrication of 3D-0D graphene-Fe3O4 quantum dot hybrids by a facile one-pot hydrothermal approach as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Fe3O4 quantum dots with an average size of 4.9 nm are anchored on the surface of 3D structured graphene nanosheets homogeneously. Such unique hierarchical structure are advantageous for enlarging the electrode/electrolyte interface area and enhancing the electrochemical activity of the hybrid materials, inhibiting particle aggregation of Fe3O4 and accommodating their volume change during the charging-discharging process as well as enabling fast diffusion of electrons and rapid transfer of electrolyte ions. Consequently, the 3D-0D graphene-Fe3O4 quantum dot hybrids exhibit ultrahigh sodium storage capacity (525 mAh g-1 at 30 mA g-1), outstanding cycling stability (312 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles at 50 mA g-1) and superior rate performance (56 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1).",

However, the major challenge is the large volume change during cycling processes, bringing about rapid capacity decay. Herein, to cope with this issue, through electrostatic spinning and high temperature calcination reduction, the unique bean pod-like free-standing membrane is designed initially, filling SbSn dots into integrated carbon matrix including hollow carbon spheres and nitrogen-doped carbon fibers (B-SbSn/NCFs). Significantly, the synergistic carbon matrix not only improves the conductivity and flexibility, but provides enough buffer space to alleviate the large volume change of metal particles. More importantly, the B-SbSn/NCFs free-standing membrane can be directly used as the anode without polymer binder and conductive agent, which improves the energy density and reaction kinetics. Satisfyingly, the free-standing BSbSn/NCFs membrane anode shows excellent electrochemical performance in SIB. The specific capacity of the membrane electrode can maintain 486.9 mAh g-1 and the coulombic efficiency is close to 100% after 400 cycles at 100 mA g-1 .

        "abstract": "Na-ion batteries (NIBs) have attracted increasing attention given the fact that sodium is relatively more plentiful and affordable than lithium for sustainable and large-scale energy storage systems. However, the shortage of electrode materials with outstanding comprehensive properties has limited the practical implementations of NIBs. Among all the discovered anode materials, transition-metal sulfide has been proven as one of the most competitive and promising ones due to its excellent redox reversibility and relatively high theoretical capacity. In this study, double-morphology N-doped CoS2/multichannel carbon nanofibers composites (CoS2/MCNFs) are precisely designed, which overcome common issues such as the poor cycling life and inferior rate performance of CoS2 electrodes. The conductive 3D interconnected multichannel nanostructure of CoS2/MCNFs provides efficient buffer zones for the release of mechanical stresses from Na+ ions intercalation/deintercalation. The synergy of the diverse structural features enables a robust frame and a rapid electrochemical reaction in CoS2/MCNFs anode, resulting in an impressive long-term cycling life of 900 cycles with a capacity of 620 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 (86.4% theoretical capacity) and a surprisingly high-power output.

The highly conductive Fe3O4 in the composite can function as a highway of electron transport, and the voids and phase boundaries in the Fe2O3/Fe3O4 heterostructure facilitate Na+ ion diffusion into the nano-aggregates.

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional ordered superstructures have been attracting considerable attention due to their interesting properties and potential applications. However, designing ideal functional superstructures with excellent electrochemical properties is still a major challenge, and an in-depth understanding of the structure-activity relationship of electrodes remains to be achieved. To elucidate this critical issue, herein, we rationally designed and synthesized for the first time superstructured TiO2/dual-doped mesoporous carbon anodes using confined space and surface coassembly strategies. Our method primarily relied on the larger interlayer space few-layered MXene and its negatively charged surface, allowing hexamethylenetetramine intercalation and surface electrostatic adsorption. The superstructured TiO2/dual-doped mesoporous carbon was successfully assembled by the thermal decomposition of a confined carbon precursor. Subsequently, the comparison of Na+-storage properties of various anodes was carried out based on the results of structural characterization techniques and electrochemical analysis methods. The results showed that the optimized anode (N/O-C@TiO2-20) can deliver a reversible capacity of 165 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g-1, indicating excellent electrochemical properties. The enhancement can be attributed to the synergistic effect of carbon domains, defective nanocrystals, and a covalently coupled interface between TiO2 and mesoporous carbon. Our work not only offered a new strategy for the assembly and regulation of superstructures to promote the electrochemical performance but also enlightened the rational design of advanced anodes for sodium-ion battery application.",

        "abstract": "While the focus of research related to the design of robust, high-performance Li-ion batteries relates primarily to the synthesis of active particles, the binder plays a crucial role in stability and ensures electrode integrity during volume changes that occur with cycling. Conventional polymeric binders such as poly(vinylidene difluoride) generally do not interact with active particle surfaces and fail to accommodate large changes in particle spacing during cycling. Thus, attention is now turning toward the exploration of interfacial interactions between composite electrode constituents as a key element in ensuring electrode stability. Recently, a poly[3-(potassium-4-butanoate)thiophene] (PPBT) binder component, coupled with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) surface coating for the active material was demonstrated to enhance both electron and ion transport in magnetite-based anodes, and it was established that the PEG/PPBT approach aids in overall battery electrode performance. Herein, the PEG/PPBT system is used as a model polymeric binder for understanding cation effects in anode systems. As such, the potassium ion was replaced with sodium, lithium, hydrogen, and ammonium through ion exchange. The potassium salt exhibited the most stable electrochemical performance, which is attributed to the cation size and resultant electrode morphology that facilitates ion transport. The lithium analogue demonstrated an initial increase in capacity but was unable to maintain this performance over 100 cycles; while the sodium-based system exhibited initially lower capacity as a result of slow reaction kinetics, which increased as cycling progressed. The parent carboxylic acid polymer and its ammonium salt were notably inferior. The results exploring the effect of ion exchange creates a framework for understanding how cations associated directly with the polymer impact electrochemical performance and aid in the overall design of binders for composite Li-ion battery anodes.",

The charge incompatibility between MoO42- and graphene oxide with negative charged functional groups on surface can be compromised with the aid of Sn4+ cations, which renders the final formation of SnS2 and MoS2 on GS surface. This is the first report of the cohybridization of MoS2 and SnS2 with GS matrix from anionic and cationic precursors in the absence of premedication of graphene surface. When MoS2/SnS2-GS acts as anodes for lithium-ion batteries, the hybrids exhibit much better cycling stability than MoS2-GS and SnS2-GS counterparts. The compact adhesion of MoS2/SnS2 nanoparticles helps offset the undesired result of destruction of electrode materials resulting from volume expansion during repeated cycles. Furthermore, by combination with their synergetic effect on interface and the presence of discrepant asynchronous electrochemical reactions for SnS2 and MoS2, MoS2/SnS2-GS hybrids are endowed with improvement of electrochemical capabilities. Besides, they also showed outstanding Na-storage ability.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfides are attractive electrode materials for both lithium-ion (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Starting from micron-sized Co(IPC)·H2O (IPC: 4-(imidazole-1-yl) phthalic acid) and polydopamine as the metal-organic framework (MOF) precursor and carbon source, respectively, we produced a CoS2/C/C composite constituting CoS2 nanoparticles decorated with N-doped carbon layers and subjected to sulfurization. N-doped carbon layers provided a robust network for the CoS2 nanoparticles, enhancing the structural integrity and electronic conductivity of the resulting CoS2/C/C composite, which exhibited electrochemical performance superior to most existing CoS2 composites, and was one of the best among all MOF derived CoS2 anodes for LIBs and SIBs. The use of nanosized CoS2 particles reduced the diffusion length for the transfer of Li+/Na+ ions, resulting in a high specific capacity at a higher current rate. N-doped carbon layers derived from the MOF precursor and polydopamine provided an electrically conductive network between the CoS2 nanoparticles, thus preventing their aggregation and inhibiting adverse side reactions between the electrolyte and the surface of the electrode, and the high pseudocapacitive contribution resulted in the enhanced rate performance of the CoS2/C/C electrodes.",

These materials are limited in their performance due to the mechanical instability of these systems resulting from volume expansion of the material during cycling. Stabilizing conversion materials using a conductive polymer binder (CPB) protective layer is an effective way to enhance the performance of these materials. There is, however, a lack of a clear understanding of how CPBs affect the (de)insertion and surface chemistry of these systems. Herein, we report the systematic investigation of the effects on Na-ion (de)insertion chemistry of a cyclized-polyacrylonitrile (cPAN) layer on Sb-based conversion electrodes in NIBS. Through electrochemical characterization, it was determined that the inclusion of a cPAN layer increases the achievable capacity of the electrode system due to the storage of Na ions by the cPAN layer and facilitates Na-ion transport to the Sb active material at early cycles by reducing the charge transfer resistance of the ensemble electrode.",

Bestowed with the integrated merits of OVs and shortened Na ion diffusion length in the nanostructure, black titania delivers a reversible specific capacity of 207.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, retains 99.1% over 500 cycles at 1 C stably, and still maintains 91.2 mAh g(-1) even at the high rate of 20 C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the lower sodiation energy barrier of anatase with OVs enables a more favorable Na intercalation into black anatase.

When used as anode electrodes for SIBs, WS2/NC composite exhibited high-rate capacity at 386 and 238.1 mAh g−1 at 50 and 2,000 mA g−1, respectively. Furthermore, even after 400 cycle, the composite electrode could still deliver a capacity of ~180.1 mAh g−1 at 1,000 mA g−1, corresponding to a capacity loss of 0.09% per cycle. The excellent electrochemical performance could be attributed to the synergistic effect of the highly conductive nature of the nitrogen-doped carbon-coating and WS2 nanosheets.

This work describes the synthesis of a series of sodium borate salts, with electrochemical studies revealing that Na[B(hfip)4]⋅DME (hfip=hexafluoroisopropyloxy, OiPrF) and Na[B(pp)2] (pp=perfluorinated pinacolato, O2C2(CF3)4) have excellent electrochemical performance. The [B(pp)2]− anion also exhibits a high tolerance to air and water.

All composites show enhancement in the overall capacity and cycling stability compared to the pristine CuP2 due to the well‐connected CNTs on and between the CuP2 particles.

However, the intrinsic pulverization and aggregation of iron sulfide electrodes induced by the conversion reaction during cycling are considered destructive and undesirable, which often impedes their capacity, rate capability, and long-term cycling stability. Herein, an interesting pulverization phenomenon of ultrathin carbon-coated Fe1- xS nanoplates (Fe1- xS@C) is observed during the first discharge process of sodium-ion batteries, which leads to the formation of Fe1- xS nanoparticles with quantum size (≈5 nm) tightly embedded in the carbon matrix. Surprisingly, no discernible aggregation phenomenon can be detected in subsequent cycles. In/ex situ experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrate that ultrafine pulverization can confer several advantages, including sustaining reversible conversion reactions, reducing the adsorption energies, and diffusion energy barriers of sodium atoms, and preventing the aggregation of Fe1- xS particles by strengthening the adsorption between pulverized Fe1- xS nanoparticles and carbon. As a result, benefiting from the unique ultrafine pulverization, the Fe1- xS@C anode simultaneously exhibits high reversible capacity (610 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1), superior rate capability (427.9 mAh g-1 at 20 A g-1), and ultralong cycling stability (377.9 mAh g-1 after 2500 cycles at 20 A g-1).",

        "abstract": "In order to develop promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), a novel pie-like FeS@C (P-FeS@C) nanohybrid, in which all ultrasmall FeS nanocrystals (NCs) are completely embedded into the carbon network and sealed by a protective carbon shell, has been prepared. The unique pie-like structure can effectively speed up the kinetics of electrode reactions, while the carbon shell stabilizes the FeS NCs inside. Studies show that the electrochemical reaction processes of P-FeS@C electrodes are dominated by the pseudocapacitive behavior, leading to an ultrafast Na+-insertion/extraction reaction. Hence, the prepared P-FeS@C nanohybrid exhibits superior Na-storage properties especially high rate capability in half cells. For example, it can deliver reversible capacities of 555.1 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 over 150 cycles and about 60.4 mA h g-1 at 80 A g-1 (an ultrahigh current density even higher than that of the capacitor test). Furthermore, an advanced P-FeS@C//Na3V2(PO4)2O2F full cell has been assembled out, which delivers a stable specific capacity of 441.2 mA h g-1 after 80 cycles at 0.5 A g-1 with a capacity retention of 91.8%.",

        "title": "Manipulating Interfacial Renovation via In Situ Formed Metal Fluoride Heterogeneous Protective Layer toward Exceptional Durable Sodium Metal Anodes",
        "abstract": "Sodium metal is regarded as an optimal anode material for high‐energy‐density sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, during the processes of sodium deposition and stripping, the failure of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film leads to the continuous accumulation of inactive sodium, thereby compromising the cycling reversibility of the battery. Here, a novel metal fluoride heterointerface layer is generated and constructed through in situ manipulation of the continuous reaction between TiF4 and metal Na. The reconstructed NaF/TiF3 interface layer, which tightly anchors the sodium metal, effectively suppresses the formation of sodium dendrites during the charge‐discharge process. The highly sodium‐philic TiF3 component exhibits strong binding with Na ions, while NaF reduces the Na+ diffusion energy barrier, significantly enhancing the reaction kinetics. Due to the successful artificial construction of this interface layer, the Na/TiF4 composite electrode demonstrates an exceptional ultra‐long cycling stability of 2370 h in symmetric cells (0.5 mAh cm−2). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further validate the functionality of each component in the Na/TiF4 protective layer. When paired with NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode in a pouch cell, it exhibits stability up to 2000 cycles at current densities of 2 C and 4 C, with a maximum energy density output of 483.1 Wh kg−1 (power density: 320.8 W kg−1).",

        "abstract": "Pyrite (FeS2) has been considered as one of the most potential anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) due to its low cost, environmentally friendly features and high theoretical capacity. However, the huge volume changes during a charge/discharge process and poor conductivity of FeS2 hindered its practical applications. Herein, we propose a facile scalable approach to prepare nanostructured FeS2 embedded in an N-doped carbon nanosheet composite (FeS2/CNS) via a combined template method and a solid state sulfuration method. N-Doped carbon nanosheets are believed to alleviate the volume variation and enhance the conductivity of an electrode, and the nanoscale particle size with an average diameter of 50-80 nm can shorten the ion-diffusion paths during a sodiation/desodiation process. As a result, the FeS2/CNS electrode exhibits high specific capacity (812 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), long cycling life (77.2% capacity retention after 350 cycles at 1 A g-1) and excellent rate capability (400 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1) when tested as an anode material for SIBs.

However, most NIBs suffer from lower volumetric energy density than LIBs. Lead (Pb) can replace hard carbon in the NIB negative electrode to substantially increase its volumetric energy density and has been shown to have no capacity fade over hundreds of cycles in half cells. Pb also experiences 387% volume expansion upon full sodiation, which presumably leads to significant changes in the electrode morphology. In this work, the morphology of Pb and Pb-hard carbon blended electrodes is tracked using scanning electron microscopy. As well, each Na-Pb phase is examined to analyze their physical properties. These analyses show that the Pb particles restructure into ~1 µm particles, even after just a single cycle, and surprisingly do not pulverize the hard carbon in a blended electrode. Single-walled carbon nanotubes appear to be necessary to maintain active material electrical connection.",

        "abstract": "The kinetics incompatibility between battery-type anode and capacitive-type cathode for sodium ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) seriously hinders their overall performance output. Herein, we construct a SIHCs device by coupling with quantum grade vanadium nitride (VN) nanodots anchored in one-dimensional N/F co-doped carbon nanofiber cages hybrids (VNQDs@PCNFs-N/F) as the freestanding anode and the corresponding activated N/F co-doped carbon nanofiber cages (APCNFs-N/F) as cathode. The strong coupling of VN quantum dots with N/F co-doped 1D conductive carbon cages effectively facilitates the ion/electron transport and intercalation-conversion-deintercalation reactions, ensuring fast sodium storage to surmount aforesaid kinetics incompatibility. Additionally, density functional theory calculations cogently manifest that the abundant active sites in the VNQDs@PCNFs-N/F configuration boost the Na+ adsorption/reaction activity well which will promote both \"intrinsic\" and \"extrinsic\" pseudocapacitance and further improve anode kinetics. Consequently, the assembled SIHCs device can achieve high energy densities of 157.1 and 95.0 Wh kg-1 at power densities of 198.8 and 9100.5 W kg-1, respectively, with an ultralong cycling life over 8000 cycles.

Mesoporous carbons, either as active materials or as hosts for guest active nanoparticles, are considered as promising electrode materials. However, addressing the issues of their short lifespan resulting from volume variation and the low coulombic efficiency caused by large surface area via a facile porous structure design still remains a challenge. Herein, a versatile phosphorus‐doped mesoporous carbon (PMC) armed is developed by graphene aerogel (GA) (GA@PMC) for hosting Na‐storage active nanoparticles. As a case study, FeSe2 nanoparticles are selectively supported onto this GA@PMC matrix, creating the FeSe2/GA@PMC composite. When employed in typical Na‐storage devices, such as Na‐ion batteries, Na‐ion hybrid capacitors, and Na‐ion based dual‐ion batteries, the FeSe2/GA@PMC electrode consistently demonstrates superior electrochemical performance. In such GA@PMC, the conformal GA can improve the entire conductivity while decreasing the specific surface area that is directly contacting with electrolyte. The interconnected macroporous structure can not only promote the diffusion of Na+ but also buffers the volume change of the guest active nanoparticles.

        "abstract": "Fe-based sulfides are a promising type of anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high theoretical capacities and affordability. However, these materials often suffer from issues such as capacity deterioration and poor conductivity during practical application. To address these challenges, an N-doped Fe7S8 anode with an N, S co-doped porous carbon framework (PPF-800) was synthesized using a template-assisted method. When serving as an anode for SIBs, it delivers a robust and ultrafast sodium storage performance, with a discharge capacity of 489 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 5 A g−1 and 371 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 30 A g−1 in the ether-based electrolyte. This impressive performance is attributed to the combined influence of heteroatomic doping and adjustable interface engineering. The N, S co-doped carbon framework embedded with Fe7S8 nanoparticles effectively addresses the issues of volumetric expansion, reduces the impact of sodium polysulfides, improves intrinsic conductivity, and stimulates the dominant pseudocapacitive contribution (90.3% at 2 mV s−1). Moreover, the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film by the effect of uniform pore structure in ether-based electrolyte produces a lower transfer resistance during the charge–discharge process, thereby boosting the rate performance of the electrode material.

        "abstract": "Post-Li-ion technologies are inevitable for solving problems connected to Li-ion cells, namely shortage of raw materials and physicochemical limits in energy density. Substitution of lithium with sodium while simultaneously replacing the liquid electrolyte with a ceramic solid electrolyte is a promising alternative.1\n \n Sodium-beta alumina is a solid-state electrolyte with outstanding chemical, electrochemical, and mechanical properties.2 So far, high-temperature cells have been using it as a solid electrolyte.3,4 However, we recently showed that the sodium-ion conducting sodium-beta alumina solid electrolyte (BASE) is also a suitable solid electrolyte for solid-state cells operating at middle- to low temperatures. We present methods commonly used to reduce the area-specific capacity at the interfaces, stemming from the poor interaction of the rigid solid electrolyte with its adjacent electrodes. Hence, we tackle the bottleneck of middle- to low-temperature solid-state cell systems utilizing BASE, leading to enhanced cell performance.2\n \n To increase the electrochemical performance, adjusting BASE´s properties is necessary. We showed that 3d transition metal doping tunes BASE´s properties effectively. For example, Ti4+ doping assisted a liquid sintering process, which changed the microstructure. Thus, BASE´s ionic conductivity increased by 50%. Simultaneously, we increased BASE´s fracture strength while reducing energy costs.5 Furthermore, we demonstrate the importance of proper storage conditions. We elucidate the effect of humidity on disk-shaped samples of Li-stabilized sodium-beta alumina and quantify the negative consequences of improper storage for cell systems using sodium-beta alumina. Despite detrimental effects on ionic conductivity and the chemical composition, the critical current density collapsed from the maximum of 9.1 mA cm-2, one of the highest values reported for sodium-beta alumina, to only 1.7 mA cm-2 at 25 °C. We show how impedance analysis and additional characterizations assist in clarifying occurring degradation mechanisms, namely ion exchange and subsequent buildup of surface layers.6\n \n Combining the knowledge from previous works, we provide a proof-of-concept for a novel sodium-based solid-state cell concept utilizing sodium-beta alumina. We use sodium metal as the negative electrode, which is necessary to achieve high specific energy and the requirement to compete with existing cell systems. An environmentally friendly transition metal oxide positive electrode with high specific energy is paired with the negative electrode. A composite positive electrode ensures intra-electrode conduction while enabling a facile charge transfer due to an intimate electrolyte–electrode interface contact, leading to stable cycling over 50 cycles with good energy retention. We think that the proof-of-concept opens the door for dozens of new material combinations and enhances the utilization of sodium-beta alumina in medium- to low-temperature solid-state cell systems.\n All in all, the presentation points out the excellent performance and the enormous potential of sodium-beta alumina for sodium-based energy storage technologies.\n References \n \n Janek, J. & Zeier, W.

        "abstract": "A sulfur doping strategy has been frequently used to improve the sodium storage specific capacity and rate capacity of hard carbon. However, some hard carbon materials have difficulty in preventing the shuttling effect of electrochemical products of sulfur molecules stored in the porous structure of hard carbon, resulting in the poor cycling stability of electrode materials. Here, a multifunctional coating is introduced to comprehensively improve the sodium storage performance of a sulfur-containing carbon-based anode. The physical barrier effect and chemical anchoring effect contributed by the abundant C-S/C-N polarized covalent bond of the N, S-codoped coating (NSC) combine to protect SGCS@NSC from the shuttling effect of soluble polysulfide intermediates. Additionally, the NSC layer can encapsulate the highly dispersed carbon spheres inside a cross-linked three-dimensional conductive network, improving the electrochemical kinetic of the SGCS@NSC electrode. Benefiting from the multifunctional coating, SGCS@NSC exhibits a high capacity of 609 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 249 mAh g−1 at 6.4 A g−1. Furthermore, the capacity retention of SGCS@NSC is 17.6% higher than that of the uncoated one after 200 cycles at 0.5 A g−1.",

        "abstract": "The upcoming energy transition requires not only renewable energy sources but also novel electricity storage systems such as batteries. Despite Li-ion batteries being the main storage systems, other batteries have been proposed to fulfil the requirements on safety, costs, and resource availability. Moving away from lithium, materials such as sodium, magnesium, zinc, and calcium are being considered. Water-based electrolytes are known for their improved safety, environmentally friendliness, and affordability. The key, however, is how to utilize the negative metal electrode, as using water-based electrolytes with these metals becomes an issue with respect to oxidation and/or dendrite formation. This work studied magnesium, where we aimed to determine if it can be electrochemically deposited in aqueous solutions with alginate-based additives to protect the magnesium. In order to do so, atomic force microscopy was used to research the morphological structure of magnesium deposition at the local scale by using a probe—the tip of a cantilever—as the active electrode, during charging and discharging. The second goal of using the AFM probe technology for magnesium deposition and stripping was an extension of our previous study in which we investigated, for lithium, whether it is possible to measure ion current and perform nonfaradaic impedance measurements at the local scale. The work presented here shows that this is possible in a relatively simple way because, with magnesium, no dendrite formation occurs, which hinders the stripping process.",

The as‐prepared TiS2 demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 1040 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 with the capacity contribution of 521 mA h g−1 in the voltage region below 1.0 V (vs Na/Na+), remarkable initial coulombic efficiency of 95.9% and superior rate capability of 621 mA h g−1 at 40 A g−1. The high conductivity of the Ti‐based compounds and nanosized particles generated by chemical conversion reactions could minimize the entropic barrier for the reversible conversion, resulting in high reversibility and ultrafast charge/discharge ability of the electrode. Moreover, with its strong ability to adsorb soluble polysulfide intermediates, the as‐prepared TiS2 electrode exhibits superior cycling stability over 9000 cycles, serving as a stable and ultra‐high capacity conversion electrode for NIBs.",

        "abstract": "The Fe-based Prussian blue (Fe-PB) composite is considered as one of the most potential cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries because of its abundant iron resources and high theoretical capacity. However, the crystal water and vacancy in the Fe-PB structure will lead to poor capacity and cycle stability. In this work, a Cu-modified Fe-PB composite (FeCu-PB@CuO) is successfully prepared through regulating the Fe-PB structure by Cu doping and engineering the surface by CuO coating. The density functional theory calculation results confirm that Cu preferentially replaces FeHS in the Fe-PB lattice and Cu doping reduces the bandgap. Our experiment results reveal that CuO coating can provide more active sites, inhibit side reactions, and potentially enhance the activity of FeHS. Due to the synergistic effect of Cu doping and CuO coating, FeCu-PB@CuO has a considerable initial discharge capacity of 123.5 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1. In particular, at 2 A g-1, it delivers an impressive initial capacity of 84.3 mAh g-1, and the capacity decreasing rate of each cycle is only 0.02% over 1500 cycles. Therefore, the synergistic modification strategy of metal ion doping and metal oxide coating has tremendous application potential and can be extended to other electrode materials.",

It is worth noting that after 180 cycles of charging and discharging at a gradually increasing current density such as 50-1000 mA g-1, it can still return to the original level after returning to 50 mA g-1. Excellent electrochemical performance and capacity stability show that NMTO-5 material is a promising electrode material.",

Nanostructure electrode materials play a crucial role in this process. However, the current method of preparation is arduous and yields restricted quantities.

When the current density was 1000 mA g-1, the discharging capacity reached 760 mAh g-1 after 400 cycles. Remarkably, even at an increased current density of 5000 mA g-1, the discharging capacity of CoS2 remained at 685.5 mAh g-1. The ultra-high performance could be attributed to the specific surface area, which minimized the diffusion distance of sodium-ions during the charging and discharging processes and mitigated the extent of structural damage. Our straightforward preparation techniques facilitate the mass production and present a novel approach for the development of cost-effective and high-performing anode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Energy storage in electrochemical hybrid capacitors involves fast faradaic reactions such as an intercalation, or redox process occurring at a solid electrode surface at an appropriate potential. Hybrid sodium‐ion electrochemical capacitors bring the advantages of both the high specific power of capacitors and the high specific energy of batteries, where activated carbon serves as a critical electrode material. The charge storage in activated carbon arises from an adsorption process rather than a redox reaction and is an electrical double‐layer capacitor. Advanced carbon materials with interconnecting porous structures possessing high surface area and high conductivity are the prerequisites 1128to qualify for efficient energy storage. Herein, we have demonstrated that a porous honeycomb structure activated carbon derived from Australian hemp hurd (Cannabis sativa L.) in aqueous Na2SO4 electrolyte showed a specific capacitance of 240 F/g at 1 A/g. The mass ratio of biochar to KOH during the chemical activation associated with the synthesis temperature influences the change in morphologies, and distribution of pore sizes on the adsorption of ions. At higher synthesis temperatures, the tubular form of the honeycomb starts to disintegrate. The hybrid sodium‐ion device employing hemp‐derived activated carbon (HAC) coupled with electrolytic manganese dioxide (EMD) in an aqueous Na2SO4 electrolyte showed a specific capacitance of 95 F/g at 1 A/g having a capacitance retention of 90 %. The hybrid device (HAC||EMD) can possess excellent electrochemical performance metrics, having a high energy density of 38 Wh/kg at a power density of 761 W/kg. Overall, this study provides insights into the influence of the activation temperature and the KOH impregnation ratio on morphology, porosity distribution, and the activated carbon's electrochemical properties with faster kinetics. The high cell voltage for the device is devoted to the EMD electrode.",

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) metal sulfides show great promises for their potential applications as electrode materials of sodium ion batteries because of the weak interlayer van der Waals interactions which allow the reversible accommodation and extraction of sodium ions. The sodiation of metal sulfides can undergo a distinct process compared to that of lithiation, which is determined by their metal and structural types. However, the structural and morphological evolution during its electrochemical sodiation is still unclear. Here, we studied the sodiation reaction dynamics of TiS2 by employing in situ transmission electron microscopy and first-principles calculations. During the sodium ion intercalation process, we observed multiple intermediate phases (phase II, phase Ib, and phase Ia), different from its lithiation counterpart, with varied sodium occupation sites and interlayer stacking sequences. Further insertion of Na ions prompted a multi-step extrusion reaction which led to the phase separation of Ti metal from the Na2S matrix, with its 2D morphology expanded to a 3D morphology. In contrast to regular conversion electrodes, TiS2 still maintained a compacted structure after a full sodiation. Frist-principles calculations reveal that the as-identified phases are thermodynamically preferred at corresponding intercalation/extrusion stages compared to other possible phases. The present work provides the fundamental mechanistic understanding of the sodiation process of 2D transition metal sulfides.",

In the Nyquist plots, the semicircles at the middle-frequency region were assigned to the parallel circuits of charge-transfer resistances and capacitances. The interfacial sodium-ion transfer resistances in concentrated organic electrolytes were much smaller than those in dilute electrolytes, and the rate capability of CNS electrodes in sodium salt-concentrated electrolytes might be better than in dilute electrolytes, suggesting that CNSs with concentrated electrolytes are the candidate of SIB negative electrode materials with high rate capability.

Herein, a zirconium-based metal-organic framework nanostructure coating (ZMOF-NSC) was constructed in a low-loss, flexible manner. Comprehensive studies show that ZMOF-NSC, with its periodically ordered nanochannels and organized pore structures, enhances ion transport and decreases the Na+ migration energy barrier, thus ensuring uniform ion flux and achieving uniform spherical deposition. Additionally, ZMOF-NSC facilitates partial desolvation, catalyzing the formation of an inorganic-rich, dual-layered SEI that effectively protects the anode and suppresses dendrite formation. Consequently, the ZMOF-NSC@Na symmetric battery exhibits an impressive lifespan of over 2500 h, demonstrating extended operational longevity. The Na3V2(PO4)3∥ZMOF-NSC@Na batteries demonstrate exceptional cycling stability with 81% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 10 C, maintaining stability over 3000 cycles at 20 C. Moreover, the NVP∥ZMOF-NSC@Na battery achieves an energy density of 370 Wh kg-1 and a power density of 10,484 W kg-1, indicating superior durability and performance.

        "abstract": "Open-framework chalcogenides are potential electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their architectures with fast-ion conductivity. Herein, we report on the successful synthesis of open-framework Cu-Ge-based chalcogenides [Cu8Ge6Se19](C5H12N)6 (CGSe) and the research of their energy storage application as SIB anodes for the first time. As a result, the CGSe anode exhibited good electrochemical performances such as high reversible capacity (463.3 mAh g−1), excellent rate performance, and considerable cycling stability. Our exploration not only develops a promising electrode material for SIBs, but also extends the application of open-framework chalcogenides.",

            "title": "The Role of Hydrothermal Carbonization in Sustainable Sodium\u2010Ion Battery Anodes",
            "abstract": "Sodium\u2010ion batteries as a prospective alternative to lithium\u2010ion batteries are facing the challenge of developing high\u2010performance, low\u2010cost and sustainable anode materials. Hard carbons are appropriate to store sodium ions, but major energy and environmental concerns during their fabrication process (i.e., high\u2010temperature carbonization) have not been properly assessed. Furthermore, the rational design of high\u2010performing hard carbon anodes is usually limited by the conventional direct carbonization of organic precursors. Here, the hydrothermal carbonization process is employed as a versatile pre\u2010treatment method of renewable precursors, followed by high\u2010temperature carbonization, for producing advanced hard carbon anodes. The critical role of hydrothermal pre\u2010treatment in regulating the structure for an optimized performance of hard carbon anodes is elucidated, while revealing the sodium\u2010ion storage mechanism using electrochemical kinetic calculations, advanced characterization and multi\u2010scale modeling. Furthermore, the environmental impacts of hydrothermal pre\u2010treatment and subsequent carbonization are evaluated using life cycle assessment compared to direct carbonization. By comparing hard carbon anodes with and without the hydrothermal pre\u2010treatment, it is verified that the additional hydrothermal process is responsible for enhanced electrochemical performance, increased carbon yields and reduced carbon emissions. The work provides a systematic understanding of functions and energy consumptions of hydrothermal systems to achieve next\u2010generation sustainable sodium\u2010ion batteries."

However, it still remains a fundamental scientific challenge to accurately understand the charge/ion transport in 3D carbon\u2010based electrodes. In this review, the operating mechanism of charge/ion transport in 3D carbon\u2010based electrodes are comprehended by introducing a useful architectural analogy to provide a physical insight. In order to better understand the relationship between 3D carbon\u2010based electrode structure and electrode process characteristics, the main design strategies of 3D carbonbased electrodes according to the specific characteristic of pore tortuosity is proposed. Through analysis of 3D carbon electrode architectural models, several key scientific issues and related characterization technologies that are beneficial to improving the charge/ion transport efficiency are also raised. The kinetics difference of ionic transport between Li+ and Na+ ions is also taken into account. Furthermore, the critical parameters of porous structure including porosity and tortuosity to investigate the parameter\u2010structure\u2010performance relationships of 3D carbon\u2010based architecture electrodes are highlighted, which in turn would guide more rational battery design in tradeoff between the high capacity and fast transport."

In this review, the fundamentals of the heat generation, accumulation, and transportation in a battery system are summarized and recent key research on materials design to improve sodium\u2010ion battery safety is highlighted.

Low-cost hexacyanometallates are promising cathodes because of their ease of synthesis and rigid open framework that enables fast Na(+) insertion and extraction. Here we report an intriguing effect of interstitial H2O on the structure and electrochemical properties of sodium manganese(II) hexacyanoferrates(II) with the nominal composition Na2MnFe(CN)6\u00b7zH2O (Na2-\u03b4MnHFC).

At a charge/discharge rate of 20 C, the half-cell capacity is 120 mAh g(-1), and at 0.7 C, the cell exhibits 75% capacity retention after 500 cycles."

            "abstract": "High-energy sodium-ion batteries have a significant prospective application as a next-generation energy storage technology. However, this technology is severely hindered by the lack of large-scale production of battery materials. Herein, a self-standing film, assembled with SnS-Sn/multiwalled carbon nanotubes encapsulated in carbon fibers (SnS-Sn/MCNTs@CFs), is prepared using ball milling and electrospinning techniques and used as sodium-ion battery anodes. To compensate the poor internal conductivity of SnS-Sn nanoparticles, MCNTs are used to interweave SnS-Sn nanoparticles to improve the conductivity. Moreover, the designed three-dimensional carbon fiber conductive network can effectively shorten the diffusion path of electron/Na+, accelerate the reaction kinetics, and provide abundant active sites for sodium absorption. Benefiting from these unique features, the self-standing film offers a high reversible capacity of 568 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and excellent cycling stability at 1 A g-1 with a reversible capacity of 359.3 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles. In the sodium-ion full cell device, the capacity is stable at 283.7 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at a current of 100 mA g-1. This work provides a new strategy for electrode design and facilitates the large-scale application of the sodium-ion battery."

The sodium\u2010ion water\u2010in\u2010salt electrolyte (NaWiSE) eliminates this barrier by offering a 2.5 V window through suppressing hydrogen evolution on anode with the formation of a Na+\u2010conducting solid\u2010electrolyte interphase (SEI) and reducing the overall electrochemical activity of water on cathode. A full aqueous Na\u2010ion battery constructed on Na0.66[Mn0.66Ti0.34]O2 as cathode and NaTi2(PO4)3 as anode exhibits superior performance at both low and high rates, as exemplified by extraordinarily high Coulombic efficiency (>99.2%) at a low rate (0.2 C) for >350 cycles, and excellent cycling stability with negligible capacity losses (0.006% per cycle) at a high rate (1 C) for >1200 cycles. Molecular modeling reveals some key differences between Li\u2010ion and Na\u2010ion WiSE, and identifies a more pronounced ion aggregation with frequent contacts between the sodium cation and fluorine of anion in the latter as one main factor responsible for the formation of a dense SEI at lower salt concentration than its Li cousin."

The underlying thermal stability, phase stability, and Na+ storage mechanisms are clearly elucidated through the systematical characterizations of electrochemical behaviors, in situ X\u2010ray diffraction at different temperatures, and operando X\u2010ray diffraction upon Na+ deintercalation/intercalation.

            "abstract": "DOI: 10.1002/aenm.201601963 and cost effective, their energy densities are moderate and still have plenty room for improvement. Our group recently developed novel aluminum-graphite DIBs using an aluminum foil directly as both the anode and current collector.[8] The key point for successful working of the novel batteries is that AlLi alloy was formed and dealloyed reversibly during charging and discharging process. This battery configuration opens up a new strategy for high-performance battery design by directly using metals as anodes/current collectors. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered to be a promising alternative to conventional LIBs for future large-scale commercial applications, due to the abundance and low cost of sodium resources and similar physical and chemical properties to lithium.[9\u201312] However, as the radius of Na+ is about 1.4 times larger than Li+, it is undoubtedly a barrier for the development of SIBs due to the lack of appropriate cathode and anode materials with reversible sodiation/desodiation.[10] In addition, the huge volume variation during intercalation/deintercalation of the larger Na+ also causes severe structural distortion, leading to poor cycling stability and rate performance.[11] Consequently, extensive efforts have been dedicated to developing new electrode materials for high-performance SIBs. For instance, cathode materials such as NaxCoO2, Na2Fe2(SO4)3, Na3V2(PO4)3, and NaxNi0.22Co0.11Mn0.66O2 have been studied and shown encouraging results. Nevertheless, the energy density of SIBs is still hindered by the moderate capacity and working voltage. Combining SIB technique with DIB technique is a promising strategy to improve the energy density, yet few works about DIBs based on sodium-ion electrolytes have been reported.[13] In this work, we first reported a novel tin-graphite DIB (named as Sn-G DIB) based on a sodium-ion electrolyte containing NaPF6 salt, using Sn foil directly as both anode and current collector, and expanded graphite as cathode. It is worthy to note that the Sn-G DIB can work reversibly with high capacity in the sodium-ion electrolyte over a high voltage window of 2.0\u20134.8 V. This battery delivers 74 mA h g\u22121 at 2 C (1 C corresponding to 100 mA g\u22121) current rate and keeps stable for 400 cycles with 94% capacity retention and high Coulombic efficiency of 95%. In addition, the packaged energy density of the Sn-G DIB achieves at 144 W h kg\u22121 at a power density of 150 W kg\u22121, which is surprisingly comparable with commercial lithium-ion batteries. Figure 1a schematically illustrates the working mechanism of the Sn-G DIB based on 1 m NaPF6 in a mixed solvent of ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) (1:1:1 v/v/v). During the charging state, PF6 anions intercalate into the graphite cathode, and Na+ cations move onto the Sn foil anode to form Na-Sn alloy (which would be demonstrated in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) Intercalation of lithium ions into anode materials of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely studied for decades.[1] For example, graphite, which has been used as a commercial anode material, can be intercalated by Li+ and form LiC6 compound with a theoretical capacity of 372 mA h g\u22121.[2] Actually, the phenomenon of anions intercalation into graphite has also been observed due to the redox amphotericity of graphite, which however has attracted much less attention. In 1938, R\u00fcdorff and Hofmann first reported anion intercalation into graphite as the cathode material for battery application.[3] By utilizing this mechanism, a novel rechargeable battery configuration named as dual-ion battery (DIB), based on both cation and anion intercalation into graphite in nonaqueous electrolytes, has also been first proposed by McCullough et al. in patents[4a,b] and Carlin et al. in their work.[4c] During the charge process, the Li+ ions are intercalated into graphite anode, while the anions are intercalated into graphite cathode simultaneously. During the discharge process, the deintercalation reactions take place on both electrodes reversely. In this DIB system, both the two graphite electrodes and the electrolyte act as active materials. Compared to conventional LIBs, one obvious advantage of the DIBs is the replacement of expensive transition metal oxide by low-cost graphite as the cathode to obtain higher working voltages (mainly above 4.5 V).[5] Subsequent researches were mainly focused on finding suitable electrolyte compositions,[5a\u2013c] high-capacity cathode materials,[5d] and matched anode materials.[5e] Read et al. reported a dual-graphite battery using a high-voltage organic electrolyte based on a fluorinated solvent.[6] The battery delivered a reversible capacity of 60 mA h g\u22121 with a capacity retention of 62% after 50 cycles at C/7 under cut-off voltage of 5.2 V. Placke and co-workers demonstrated a highly stable dual-graphite battery based on an ionic liquid electrolyte with solid electrolyte interface (SEI) forming additive.[7] The DIB presented good cycling stability with a discharge capacity of 50 mA h g\u22121 at 500 mA g\u22121 for 500 cycles. Although these DIBs show potential application as a promising energy storage device with merits of high voltage, environmental friendly, safe,"

Creating new battery-related energy storage facilities is an urgent subject for human beings to address and for solutions for the future. Compared with lithium-based batteries, sodium-ion batteries have become the new focal point in the competition for clean energy solutions and have more potential for commercialization due to the huge natural abundance of sodium. Nevertheless, sodium-ion batteries still exhibit some challenges, like inferior electrochemical performance caused by the bigger ionic size of Na+ ions, the detrimental volume expansion, and the low conductivity of the active materials. To solve these issues, nanocomposites have recently been applied as a new class of electrodes to enhance the electrochemical performance in sodium batteries based on advantages that include the size effect, high stability, and excellent conductivity.

More and more nanostructured anode materials have been developed with the aims of high energy density, high cycling stability, and excellent rate capability, in which two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures are showing promise due to their shortened paths for sodium ion transportation and larger surface areas for sodium ion absorption. Moreover, 2D materials (e.g. graphene) have been proved to be excellent supporting and conducting agents in SIB anodes due to their high electrical conductivity and structural stability, in which synergetic effects between the graphene and the active materials are generally observed. This review is devoted to the recent progress in the use of 2D active materials and in composites consisting of both 2D supports and active materials as anodes for SIBs. Based on the manner of sodium storage, their electrochemical performance for sodium storage is discussed in terms of four classifications, including carbonaceous materials (graphene and carbon nanosheets), alloy based materials (Sn, Sb, and P), conversion materials (phosphides/oxides/sulfides/selenides), and intercalation materials (Ti-based compounds).

At present, the practical utilization of hard carbon anodes is largely limited by the low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). Na ions have been found to adopt an adsorption\u2013insertion storage mechanism. In this paper a systematic way to control the defect concentration and porosity of hard carbon with similar overall architectures is shown. This study elucidates that the defects in the graphite layers are directly related to the ICE as they would trap Na ions and create a repulsive electric field for other Na ions so as to shorten the low\u2010voltage intercalation capacity. The obtained low defect and porosity hard carbon electrode has achieved the highest ICE of 86.1% (94.5% for pure hard carbon material by subtracting that of the conductive carbon black), reversible capacity of 361 mA h g\u22121, and excellent cycle stability (93.4% of capacity retention over 100 cycles).

By inheriting the unique cellular structure of peat moss leaves, the resultant materials are composed of three-dimensional macroporous interconnected networks of carbon nanosheets (as thin as 60 nm). The peat moss tissue is highly cross-linked, being rich in lignin and hemicellulose, suppressing the nucleation of equilibrium graphite even at 1100 \u00b0C. Rather, the carbons form highly ordered pseudographitic arrays with substantially larger intergraphene spacing (0.388 nm) than graphite (c/2 = 0.3354 nm). XRD analysis demonstrates that this allows for significant Na intercalation to occur even below 0.2 V vs Na/Na(+). By also incorporating a mild (300 \u00b0C) air activation step, we introduce hierarchical micro- and mesoporosity that tremendously improves the high rate performance through facile electrolyte access and further reduced Na ion diffusion distances.

However, their inferior electrochemical performances, especially cyclability, become the major challenge for further development of SIBs. Large volume change and sluggish diffusion kinetics are generally considered to be responsible for the fast capacity degradation. Here we report the strong chemical bonding of nanostructured Sb2S3 on sulfur-doped graphene sheets (Sb2S3/SGS) that enables a stable capacity retention of 83% for 900 cycles with high capacities and excellent rate performances. To the best of our knowledge, the cycling performance of the Sb2S3/SGS composite is superior to those reported for any other Sb-based materials for SIBs. Computational calculations demonstrate that sulfur-doped graphene (SGS) has a stronger affinity for Sb2S3 and the discharge products than pure graphene, resulting in a robust composite architecture for outstanding cycling stability.

Metal sulfides with high theoretical capacity and good electrical conductivity are promising anode candidates for SIB, however, the structural collapse caused by severe volume change during the de/sodiation process typically results in a fast capacity decay, limited rate capability, and cycling stability. In this work, by careful composition and structure design, polydopamine coated Prussian blue analogs derived carbon coated bimetallic sulfide hollow nanocubes (PBCS) are prepared with distinguished morphology, higher surface area, smaller charge transfer resistance, and higher sodium diffusion coefficient than the uncoated bimetallic sulfides.

However, the large volume variation during electrochemical cycling makes it difficult to use for practical applications. Herein, the reversible performance of BP in SIB is significantly enhanced by bridging covalently functionalized BP on graphene. The enhanced interaction between the chemical functionalized BP and graphene improves the stability of BP during long-cycle running of SIB. The bridging reduces the surface energy and increases thickness of BP available for enlarging the channel between BP nanosheet and graphene. The enlarged channel stores more sodium ions for improving cycle performance. Significantly, two types of phosphorus-carbon bond are first detected during experimental analysis. Benefiting from the strategy, the BP-based SIB anode exhibits 1472 mAh g-1 specific capacity at 0.1 A g-1 in the 50th cycle and 650 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 200 cycles."

Tin is one of most promising SIB anode materials, which alloys with up to 3.75 Na, leading to a charge storage capacity of 847 mAh g(-1). In this Account, we outline the state-of-the-art understanding regarding the sodiation-induced phase transformations and the associated performance in a range of Sn-based systems, treating metallic Sn and its alloys, tin oxide (SnO2), tin sulfide (SnS2/SnS), and tin phosphide (Sn4P3). We first detail what is known about the sodiation sequence in metallic Sn, highlighting the most recent insight into the reactions prior to the terminal equilibrium Na15Sn4 intermetallic. We explain why researchers argue that the equilibrium (phase diagram) series of phase transitions does not occur in this system, and rather why sodiation/desodiation proceeds through a series of metastable crystalline and amorphous structures. We also outline the recent modeling-based insight regarding how this phase transition profoundly influences the mechanical properties of the alloy, progressively changing the bonding and the near neighbor arrangement from \"Sn-like\" to \"Na-like\" in the process. We then go on to discuss the sodiation reactions in SnO2. We argue that while a substantial amount of experimental work already exists where the focus is on synthesis and testing of tin oxide-based nanocomposites, the exact sodiation sequence is just beginning to be understood. Unlike in Sn and Sn alloys, where capacities near the theoretical are reached at least early during cycling, SnO2 never quite achieves anything close to the 1398 mAh g(-1) that would be possible with a combination of fully reversible conversion and alloying reactions. We highlight recent work demonstrating that contrary to general expectations, it is the Sn to Na15Sn4 alloying reaction that is incomplete and hence limits the capacity of the electrode. We also describe how the oxide conversion reaction goes through an intermediate SnO phase, and how its reversibility in a half-cell is highly dependent on the terminal anodic voltage. We then present what is known about sodiation of tin sulfide and of tin phosphide phases, including emerging microstructural evidence that may explain why both the sulfides and the phosphides are unable to achieve their highly promising theoretical capacities under conventional electrode testing conditions. Finally, we provide a broad comparison of the capacity (cycling and rate) performance for a range of Sn based anode materials, and show that there may be indeed an optimum microstructural architecture."

Fundamental research focused on understanding the structural and electronic processes occurring on electrochemical cycling is key to devising rechargeable batteries with improved performance. We present an in-depth investigation of the effect of Mg doping on the electrochemical performance and structural stability of Na2/3MnO2 with a P2 layer stacking by comparing three compositions: Na2/3Mn1\u2212yMgyO2 (y = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1). We show that Mg substitution leads to smoother electrochemistry, with fewer distinct electrochemical processes, improved rate performance and better capacity retention. These observations are attributed to the more gradual structural changes upon charge and discharge, as observed with synchrotron, powder X-ray, and neutron diffraction. Mg doping reduces the number of Mn3+ Jahn\u2013Teller centers and delays the high voltage phase transition occurring in P2-Na2/3MnO2. The local structure is investigated using 23Na solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy. The ssNMR data provide direct evidence for fewer oxygen layer shearing events, leading to a stabilized P2 phase, and an enhanced Na-ion mobility up to 3.8 V vs. Na+/Na upon Mg doping. The 5% Mg-doped phase exhibits one of the best rate performances reported to date for sodium-ion cathodes with a P2 structure, with a reversible capacity of 106 mA h g\u22121 at the very high discharge rate of 5000 mA g\u22121.

In order to improve the cycle performance, Sn/N-doped carbon microcage composites (Sn/NMCs) with Sn nanodots uniformly embedded inside the N-doped carbon microcages are synthesized through a simple spray drying process, followed by thermal treatment. When used as electrodes, Sn/NMCs exhibit an initial reversible capacity of 780 mA h g\u22121 at 200 mA g\u22121, and maintain 472 mA h g\u22121 after 500 cycles in LIBs.

The remarkable electrochemical performance is mainly owing to the advanced structure of Sn/NMCs, which could be attributed to the pore-formation using NaCl, and the grain size inhibition of Sn using N-doped carbon. Moreover, this preparation method is accessible to scale up and can be extended to fabricate other electrode materials."

            "abstract": "With the increasing use of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), developing cost-effective anode materials, such as metal oxide, for Na-ion storage is one of the most attractive topics. Due to the obviously larger ion radius of Na than that of Li, most metal oxide electrode materials fail to exhibit the same high performance for SIBs like that of Li-ion batteries. Herein, iron oxide was employed to demonstrate a concept that rationally designing an amorphous structure should be useful to enhance Na-ion storage performance of a metal oxide. Amorphous Fe2O3/graphene composite nanosheets (Fe2O3@GNS) were successfully synthesized by a facile approach as anodes for SIBs. It reveals that amorphous Fe2O3 nanoparticles with an average diameter of 5 nm were uniformly anchored on the surface of graphene nanosheets by the strong C-O-Fe oxygen-bridge bond. Compared to well-crystalline Fe2O3, amorphous Fe2O3@GNS exhibited superior sodium storage properties such as high electrochemical activity, high initial Coulombic efficiency of 81.2%, and good rate performance. At a current density of 100 mA/g, amorphous Fe2O3@GNS composites show a specific capacity of 440 mAh/g, which is obviously higher than the specific capacity of 284 mAh/g of crystalline Fe2O3. Even at a high current density of 2 A/g, amorphous Fe2O3@GNS composites still exhibit a specific capacity as high as 219 mAh/g. The excellent electrochemical performance should be attributed to the amorphous structures of Fe2O3 as well as strongly interfacial interaction between Fe2O3 and GNS, which not only accommodate more electrochemical active sites and provide the more transmission channels for sodium ions but also benefit electron transfer as well as effectively buffer the volume change of host materials during sodiation and desodiation. This concept for designing amorphous iron oxide anodes for SIBs is also expected to facilitate preparation of various amorphous nanostructure of other metal oxides and improve their Na-ion storage performance."

Development of advanced NIB techniques with potentially higher performance is of great concern to meet the requirements of ESSs. Based on modern material characterization methods and technological optimizations, the systematic understanding of rechargeable batteries has been further developed. Novel methods for NIB materials could provide a rational guideline for the fundamental understanding and practical optimization of battery systems. Here, the focus is mainly on a discussion of novel or fresh experimental methods and characterization techniques for NIB materials from the relationships between properties and performances, which are roughly classified into four parts: structure-related techniques, composition-related techniques, size- and morphology-related techniques, and surface- and interface-related techniques. Respective detection mechanisms of each method will be discussed, and special attention is paid to examples of these characterization techniques for NIB devices. It is hoped that by the study of NIB-related details, a certain reference to the development of advanced materials can be provided."

            "abstract": "Structural phase transitions can be used to alter the properties of a material without adding any additional elements and are therefore of significant technological value. It was found that the hexagonal-SnS2 phase can be transformed into the orthorhombic-SnS phase after an annealing step in an argon atmosphere, and the thus transformed SnS shows enhanced sodium-ion storage performance over that of the SnS2, which is attributed to its structural advantages. Here, we provide the first report on a SnS@graphene architecture for application as a sodium-ion battery anode, which is built from two-dimensional SnS and graphene nanosheets as complementary building blocks. The as-prepared SnS@graphene hybrid nanostructured composite delivers an excellent specific capacity of 940 mAh g(-1)and impressive rate capability of 492 and 308 mAh g(-1) after 250 cycles at the current densities of 810 and 7290 mA g(-1), respectively. The performance was found to be much better than those of most reported anode materials for Na-ion batteries. On the basis of combined ex situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and ex situ X-ray diffraction, the formation mechanism of SnS@graphene and the synergistic Na-storage reactions of SnS in the anode are discussed in detail. The SnS experienced a two-structural-phase transformation mechanism (orthorhombic-SnS to cubic-Sn to orthorhombic-Na3.75Sn), while the SnS2 experienced a three-structural-phase transformation mechanism (hexagonal-SnS2 to tetragonal-Sn to orthorhombic-Na3.75Sn) during the sodiation process. The lesser structural changes of SnS during the conversion are expected to lead to good structural stability and excellent cycling stability in its sodium-ion battery performance. These results demonstrate that the SnS@graphene architecture offers unique characteristics suitable for high-performance energy storage application."

The capacity was sustained with a loss of less than 10% after 1000 discharge\u2013charge cycles at a rate of 2 C or 10 C.

However, SnO2-based anodes still cannot be used in practical sodium-ion batteries because they experience large volume changes during repetitive charge and discharge cycles. Such large volume changes lead to severe pulverization of the active material and loss of electrical contact between the SnO2 and carbon conductor, which in turn result in rapid capacity loss during cycling. Here, we introduce a new amorphous carbon-coated SnO2-electrodeposited porous carbon nanofiber (PCNF@SnO2@C) composite that not only has high sodium storage capability, but also maintains its structural integrity while ongoing repetitive cycles. Electrochemical results revealed that this SnO2-containing nanofiber composite anode had excellent electrochemical performance including high-capacity (374 mAh g(-1)), good capacity retention (82.7%), and large Coulombic efficiency (98.9% after 100th cycle)."

Although the layered transition metal oxides, NaMO2 (M: transition metal), are the most promising cathode materials owing to their high theoretical capacity with much more stable nature than Li1\u2013xMO2 system, factors influencing the redox potential have not yet been fully understood. Here, we identify redox potential paradox, E(Ni3+/Ni2+) > E(Ni4+/Ni3+), in an identical structural framework, namely, NaTi4+0.5Ni2+0.5O2 and NaFe3+0.5Ni3+0.5O2, which is induced by transition of the oxides from Mott\u2013Hubbard to negative charge-transfer regimes. The origin of the unusually low E(Ni4+/Ni3+) is the surprisingly large contribution (over 80%) of oxygen orbital to the redox reaction, of which the primary effect on the electrochemical property is demonstrated for the first time, providing a firm platform to design better cathodes for advanced sodium-i..."

            "abstract": "There is intense interest in sodium-ion batteries as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries for electric storage applications because of the low-cost and abundant sodium resources. Na0.67Ni0.33-xMgxMn0.67O2 compounds (x = 0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, or 0.15) were prepared by a sol-gel method and used as a cathode for sodium-ion batteries. The X-ray powder diffraction measurements demonstrated that the obtained samples have a pure P2 phase. Na0.67Ni0.23Mg0.1Mn0.67O2 delivers an initial reversible capacity of 105 mAh g(-1) in the potential region from 2.0 to 4.5 V at a charge/discharge current density of 48 mA g(-1). Moreover, the cyclability is improved by doping Mg. The capacity of Na0.67Ni0.23Mg0.1Mn0.67O2 can remain at approximately 84.9 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 48 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles. The improved high rate performance of Na0.67Ni0.23Mg0.1Mn0.67O2 was attributed to the increased lattice parameters and d spacing of the Na(+) layer. Therefore, Mg-doped Na0.67Ni0.23Mg0.1Mn0.67O2 is a promising cathode for sodium-ion batteries with excellent rate and cyclic performance."

Fe2O3 with optimized subunits was produced using water (W\u2013Fe2O3). The core is assembled by smaller nanoparticles of \u223c50 nm. The thicker shell and exterior surface possess porous nanorods. These peculiar subunits endow W\u2013Fe2O3 with a higher specific surface area, more pore volume and larger nanopores. W\u2013Fe2O3 displayed 733.1 mA h g\u22121 at 6000 mA g\u22121, which is more than two times that of E\u2013Fe2O3 (306.5 mA h g\u22121).

The significantly different performances between E\u2013Fe2O3 and W\u2013Fe2O3 can be almost entirely attributed to their distinctive subunits.

Here, micron-sized plate-like copper-substituted layered P2-type Na0.67CuxMn1\u2212xO2 is demonstrated to rapidly charge and discharge within 5 minutes while giving a capacity of more than 90 mA h g\u22121, corresponding to a half-cell energy density of 260 W h (kg cathode)\u22121 at a power density of 3000 W (kg cathode)\u22121, which is comparable to that of high-power lithium-ion cathodes. The materials show excellent stability, retaining more than 70% of the initial capacity after 500 cycles at 1000 mA g\u22121. The good cycle and rate performances of the materials are attributed to copper in the lattice, which stabilizes the crystal structure, increases the average discharge potential and improves sodium transport.

However, the development of anode materials for SIBs to date has been mainly limited to carbonaceous materials with minimal research devoted to high capacity alloy-based materials. In this study, an antimony (Sb)/carbon (C) electrode with ~30 nm Sb nanoparticles (NPs) uniformly encapsulated in interconnecting one-dimensional (1D) 400 nm carbon fibers (denoted as SbNP@C) was fabricated using a simple and scalable electrospinning method. This binder-free, current collector-free SbNP@C electrode demonstrated high capacity and stable long-term cycling performance at various current densities. The SbNP@C electrode showed an initial total capacity of 422 mAh/gelectrode and retained 350 mAh/gelectrode after 300 deep charge-discharge cycles under 100 mA/gSb. Moreover, because of the efficient 1D sodium-ion transport pathway and the highly conductive network of SbNP@C, the electrode preserved high overall capacities even when cycled at high currents, extending its usability to high power applications."

            "abstract": "Taking advantage of sodium polyacrylate, composed of interlaced carbon chains and inorganic functional groups (\u2013COONa) uniformly grafted onto the carbon chains, a three-dimensional hard carbon matrix (3DHCM) has been obtained. The resultant material is composed of three-dimensional macroporous interconnected networks of carbon nanosheets (thickness, 5\u201330 nm). The 3DHCM has been studied as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries. The unique three-dimensional porous structure results in a high initial charge capacity of 341 mA h g\u22121, stable cycling capacity of 232.8 mA h g\u22121 (after 100 cycles, 50 mA g\u22121), superior-rate performance (stable capacities of 210, 197, 128 and 112 mA h g\u22121 at 200, 500, 5000, 8000 mA g\u22121, respectively) and ultralong cycle life (116 mA h g\u22121 at 4 A g\u22121 after 3000 cycles). At the same time, an increase in the trend of the sloping capacity percentage at total discharge is observed. More obvious \u201cgraphitic\u201d domains with larger interplanar spacing (\u223c0.46 nm) were produced in the electrochemical cycles and detected using ex situ HRTEM, further confirming that the first higher-voltage region (above 0.1 V) should be attributed to the sodium insertion between the parallel graphene layers in the hard carbon. We also find that the electrolyte (1 M NaClO4 in PC) severely decomposes at the electrode/electrolyte interface during deep electrochemical cycles (6000 cycles), resulting in the deterioration of the electrode and fast capacity fading. Furthermore, a room-temperature sodium-ion full cell was constructed using 3DHCM as an anode and Na3V2(PO4)3/C as a cathode, (\u2212) 3DHCM\u20161 M NaClO4 in PC\u2016Na3V2(PO4)3/C (+), delivering a discharge capacity of 90 mA h g\u22121 at a current density of 500 mA g\u22121. We believe that our findings will be helpful in speeding up the development of room-temperature high-rate, long life and low cost sodium-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage systems, and even as alternatives to lithium-ion batteries."

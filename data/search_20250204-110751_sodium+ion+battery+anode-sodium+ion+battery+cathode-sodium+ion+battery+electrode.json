        "abstract": "Molybedenum disulfide (MoS2) is regarded as a promising anode material for next-generation sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to its high theoretical capacity. However, its low conductivity, large volume changes, and undesirable phase transformation hinder its practical applications. In this study, we synthesize a hierarchically designed core-shell heterostructure based on nitrogen-doped MoS2/C and silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) (N-MoS2/C@SiOC) via the facile pyrolysis of a suspension of an N-MoS2/polyfurfural precursor in silicone oil. The in situ nitrogen doping in a two-dimensional MoS2 structure with carbon incorporation leads to the enlargement of the interlayer spacing and enhancement of the electronic conductivity and mechanical stability, which allows the facile, highly reversible insertion and extraction of sodium ions upon cycling. Further, the nanoscale SiOC shell with surface capacitive reactivity provides a conductive pathway, preventing unfavorable side reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface and acting as a structure-reinforcing buffer against severe volume expansion issues. As a result, the N-MoS2/C@SiOC composite exhibits high reversible capacity (540.7 mAh g-1), high-capacity retention (>100% after 200 cycles), and excellent rate capability up to 10 A g-1. The simple hierarchical core-shell design strategy developed in this study allows for the fabrication of high-performance metal sulfide anodes as well as other high-capacity anode materials for energy storage applications.",

        "title": "Sandwich-Like SnS2/Graphene/SnS2 with Expanded Interlayer Distance as High-Rate Lithium/Sodium-Ion Battery Anode Materials.",
        "abstract": "SnS2 materials have attracted broad attention in the field of electrochemical energy storage due to its layered structure with high specific capacity. However, the easy restacking property during charge/discharge cycling would lead to electrode structure instability and serve capacity decrease. In this paper, we report a simple one-step hydrothermal synthesis of SnS2/graphene/SnS2 (SnS2/rGO/SnS2) composite with ultrathin SnS2 nanosheets covalently decorated on both sides of reduced graphene oxide sheets via C‒S bonds. Owing to the graphene sandwiched between two SnS2 sheets, the composite presents an enlarged interlayer spacing of ~8.03 Å for SnS2, which could facilitate the insertion/extraction of Li+/Na+ ion with rapid transport kinetics, as well as inhibiting the re-stacking of SnS2 nanosheets during the charge/discharge cycling. The density functional theory calculation reveals the most stable state of the moderate interlayer spacing for the sandwich-like composite. The diffusion coefficients of Li/Na-ions from both molecular simulation and experimental observation also demonstrate that that this state is the most suitable for fast ions transport. In addition, numerous ultra-tiny SnS2 nanoparticles anchored on the graphene sheets can generate dominant pseudocapacitive contribution to the composite especially at large current density, guaranteeing its excellent high-rate performance with 844 and 765 mAh g-1 for Li/Na-ion batteries even at 10 A g‒1. No distinct morphology changes occur after 200 cycles, and the SnS2 nanoparticles still recover to pristine phase without distinct agglomeration, demonstrate that this composite with high rate capabilities and excellent cycle stability are the promising candidate for lithium/sodium storage.",

        "abstract": "We report the fabrication of 3D flower-like MoS2 nanosheets arrays on carbon cloth as a binder-free anode for sodium ion battery. Ultrathin and conformal TiO2 layers are used to modify the surface of MoS2 by atomic layer deposition. The electrochemical performance measurements demonstrate that the ALD TiO2 layer can improve the cycling stability and rate capability of MoS2. The MoS2 nanosheets with 0.5-nm TiO2 coating electrode show the highest initial discharge capacity of 1392 mA h g-1 at 200 mA g-1, which is increased by 53% compared with that of bare MoS2. After 150 cycles, the capacity retention rate of the TiO2-coated MoS2 achieves 75.8% of its second cycle's capacity at 200 mA h g-1 in contrast to that of 59% of pure MoS2. Furthermore, the mechanism behind the experimental results is revealed by ex situ scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterizations, which confirms that the ultrathin TiO2 modifications can prevent the structural degradation and the formation of SEI film of MoS2 electrode.",

Switchgrass derived carbon materials intrinsically inherit its three-dimensional porous hierarchical architecture, with an average interlayer spacing of 0.376 nm. The larger interlayer spacing than that of graphite allows for the significant Na ion storage performance.

        "abstract": "Maintaining structural stability is a great challenge for high-capacity conversion electrodes with large volume change but is necessary for the development of high-energy-density, long-cycling batteries. Here, we report a stable phosphorus anode for sodium ion batteries by the synergistic use of chemically bonded phosphorus-carbon nanotube (P-CNT) hybrid and cross-linked polymer binder. The P-CNT hybrid was synthesized through ball-milling of red phosphorus and carboxylic group functionalized carbon nanotubes. The P-O-C bonds formed in this process help maintain contact between phosphorus and CNTs, leading to a durable hybrid. In addition, cross-linked carboxymethyl cellulose-citric acid binder was used to form a robust electrode. As a result, this anode delivers a stable cycling capacity of 1586.2 mAh/g after 100 cycles, along with high initial Coulombic efficiency of 84.7% and subsequent cycling efficiency of ∼99%. The unique electrode framework through chemical bonding strategy reported here is potentially inspirable for other electrode materials with large volume change in use.",

        "abstract": "Cellulose is a promising natural bio-macromolecule due to its abundance, renewability and low cost. Here, a new method is developed to prepare pre-sodiated carbonaceous anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) from cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) under microwave irradiation for potential ultrafast and large-scale manufacturing. While direct carbonization of CNFs through microwave treatment is usually impossible due to the weak microwave absorption of CNFs, it is found that a small amount of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) can act as an effective initiator. Microwaving rGO releases extremely high energy, giving rise to local ultrahigh temperature as well as ultrahigh heating rate, which then induces the fast carbonization of CNFs and the production of pre-sodiated carbonaceous materials within seconds. The sodium in the carbonaceous materials, introduced from the carbonization of CNFs containing sodium-ion carboxyl, offer favorable spaces for sodiation/desodiation, which improves the electrochemical performance of the sodium-inserted carbonaceous anode. When the microwaved rGO-CNF (MrGO-CNF) is used as an anode for SIBs, a high initial capacity of 558 mAh g-1 is delivered and the capacity of 340 mAh g-1 remains after 200 cycles. The excellent reversible capacity and cycling stability indicate MrGO-CNF a promising anode for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "We systematically investigated the potential of single-layer VS2 polytypes as Na-battery anode materials via density functional theory calculations. We found that sodiation tends to inhibit the 1H-to-1T structural phase transition, in contrast to lithiation-induced transition on monolayer MoS2. Thus, VS2 can have better structural stability in the cycles of charging and discharging. Diffussion of Na atom was found to be very fast on both polytypes, with very small diffusion barriers of 0.085 eV (1H) and 0.088 eV (1T). Ab initio random structure searching was performed in order to explore stable configurations of Na on VS2. Our search found that both the V top and the hexagonal center sites are preferred adsorption sites for Na, with the 1H phase showing a relatively stronger binding. Notably, our random structures search revealed that Na clusters can form as a stacked second layer at full Na concentration, which is not reported in earlier works wherein uniform, single-layer Na adsorption phases were assumed. With reasonably high specific energy capacity (232.91 and 116.45 mAh/g for 1H and 1T phases, respectively) and open-circuit voltage (1.30 and 1.42 V for 1H and 1T phases, respectively), VS2 is a promising alternative material for Na-ion battery anodes with great structural sturdiness. Finally, we have shown the capability of the ab initio random structure searching in the assessment of potential materials for energy storage applications.",

In this study, an antimony (Sb)/carbon (C) electrode with ~30 nm Sb nanoparticles (NPs) uniformly encapsulated in interconnecting one-dimensional (1D) 400 nm carbon fibers (denoted as SbNP@C) was fabricated using a simple and scalable electrospinning method. This binder-free, current collector-free SbNP@C electrode demonstrated high capacity and stable long-term cycling performance at various current densities. The SbNP@C electrode showed an initial total capacity of 422 mAh/gelectrode and retained 350 mAh/gelectrode after 300 deep charge-discharge cycles under 100 mA/gSb. Moreover, because of the efficient 1D sodium-ion transport pathway and the highly conductive network of SbNP@C, the electrode preserved high overall capacities even when cycled at high currents, extending its usability to high power applications.",

To overcome this problem, we reported a facile strategy to compensate the irreversible capacity loss of HC anodes simply by a chemical presodiation reaction of the HC electrode with a sodiation reagent (sodium biphenyl, Na-Bp). Benefiting from the strong sodiation ability of Na-Bp, HC anode can be presodiated rapidly in a very short time and the presodiated HC (NaxHC) is found to have a desirable ICE of 100%. When coupled with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode to build a SIB full cell, the NaxHC||Na3V2(PO4)3 cell exhibit a high ICE of ~95.0% and an elevated energy density of 218 Wh kg-1, which is far superior to that of control cell using pristine HC anode (50% ICE and 120 Wh kg-1), suggesting great advantages brought by the chemical presodiation process. More importantly, this presodiation reaction is very mild, highly eﬃcient and can be widely extended to a variety of Na-storage materials, offering a new route to develop high performance Na-storage materials for practical battery applications.",

        "abstract": "Sodium resources are inexpensive and abundant, and hence, sodium-ion batteries are promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries. However, lower energy density and poor cycling stability of current sodium-ion batteries prevent their practical implementation for future smart power grid and stationary storage applications. Tin oxides (SnO2) can be potentially used as a high-capacity anode material for future sodium-ion batteries, and they have the advantages of high sodium storage capacity, high abundance, and low toxicity. However, SnO2-based anodes still cannot be used in practical sodium-ion batteries because they experience large volume changes during repetitive charge and discharge cycles. Such large volume changes lead to severe pulverization of the active material and loss of electrical contact between the SnO2 and carbon conductor, which in turn result in rapid capacity loss during cycling. Here, we introduce a new amorphous carbon-coated SnO2-electrodeposited porous carbon nanofiber (PCNF@SnO2@C) composite that not only has high sodium storage capability, but also maintains its structural integrity while ongoing repetitive cycles. Electrochemical results revealed that this SnO2-containing nanofiber composite anode had excellent electrochemical performance including high-capacity (374 mAh g(-1)), good capacity retention (82.7%), and large Coulombic efficiency (98.9% after 100th cycle).",

        "abstract": "The dual-ion battery (DIB) system has attracted great attention owing to its merits of low cost, high energy, and environmental friendliness. However, the DIBs based on sodium-ion electrolytes are seldom reported due to the lack of appropriate anode materials for reversible Na+ insertion/extraction. Herein, a new sodium-ion based DIB named as MoS2 /C-G DIB using penne-like MoS2 /C nanotube as anode and expanded graphite as cathode is constructed and optimized for the first time. The hierarchical MoS2 /C nanotube provides expanded (002) interlayer spacing of 2H-MoS2 , which facilitates fast Na+ insertion/extraction reaction kinetics, thus contributing to improved DIB performance. The MoS2 /C-G DIB delivers a reversible capacity of 65 mA h g-1 at 2 C in the voltage window of 1.0-4.0 V, with good cycling performance for 200 cycles and 85% capacity retention, indicating the feasibility of potential applications for sodium-ion based DIBs.",

        "abstract": "Red phosphorus (P) has attracted intense attention as promising anode material for high‐energy density sodium‐ion batteries (NIBs), owing to its high sodium storage theoretical capacity (2595 mAh g−1). Nevertheless, natural insulating property and large volume variation of red P during cycling result in extremely low electrochemical activity, leading to poor electrochemical performance. Herein, the authors demonstrate a rational strategy to improve sodium storage performance of red P by confining nanosized amorphous red P into zeolitic imidazolate framework‐8 (ZIF‐8) ‐derived nitrogen‐doped microporous carbon matrix (denoted as P@N‐MPC). When used as anode for NIBs, the P@N‐MPC composite displays a high reversible specific capacity of ≈600 mAh g−1 at 0.15 A g−1 and improved rate capacity (≈450 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 1000 cycles with an extremely low capacity fading rate of 0.02% per cycle). The superior sodium storage performance of the P@N‐MPC is mainly attributed to the novel structure. The N‐doped porous carbon with sub‐1 nm micropore facilitates the rapid diffusion of organic electrolyte ions and improves the conductivity of the encapsulated red P. Furthermore, the porous carbon matrix can buffer the volume change of red P during repeat sodiation/desodiation process, keeping the structure intact after long cycle life.",

The electrode delivered a reversible capacity of 384.8 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1 and a good rate capability of 221.9 mA h g-1, even at 1 A g-1. Its electrochemical performance is better than any anode material reported so far for PIBs. It was also found that the Sn4P3/C electrode displays a discharge potential plateau of 0.1 V in PIBs, slightly higher than for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) (0.01 V), and well above the plating potential of metal. This diminishes the formation of dendrites during cycling, and thus Sn4P3 is a relatively safe anode material, especially for application in large-scale energy storage, where large amounts of electrode materials are used. Furthermore, a possible reaction mechanism of the Sn4P3/C composite as PIB anode is proposed.

The all‐around encapsulation (plane‐to‐plane contact) architecture that provides a large interface between N‐graphene and SnSb nanocrystal not only effectively enhances the electron conductivity and structural integrity of the overall electrode, but also offers excess interfacial sodium storage, thus leading to much enhanced high‐rate sodium storage capacity and stability, which has been proven by both experimental results and first‐principles simulations.

The main challenges associated with MoS2 are the low rate capability suffering from the sluggish kinetics of Na+ intercalation and the poor cycling stability owning to the stack of MoS2 sheets. In this work, a unique architecture of bundled defect-rich MoS2 (BD-MoS2 ) that consists of MoS2 with large vacancies bundled by ultrathin MoO3 is achieved via a facile quenching process. When employed as anode for a SIB, the BD-MoS2 electrode exhibits an ultrafast charge/discharge due to the pseudocapacitive-controlled Na+ storage mechanism in it. Further experimental and theoretical calculations show that Na+ is able to cross the MoS2 layer by vacancies, not only limited to diffusion along the layer, thus realizing a 3D Na+ diffusion with faster kinetics. Meanwhile, the bundling architecture reduces the stack of sheets with a superior cycle life illustrating the highly reversible capacities of 350 and 272 mAh g-1 at 2 and 5 A g-1 after 1000 cycles.",

At a charge/discharge rate of 20 C, the half-cell capacity is 120 mAh g(-1), and at 0.7 C, the cell exhibits 75% capacity retention after 500 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Antimony- (Sb) based materials have been considered as one of promising anodes for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high theoretical capacities and appropriate sodium inserting potentials. So far, the reported energy density and cycling stability of the Sb-based anodes for SIBs are quite limited and need to be significantly improved. Here, we develop a novel Sb/C hybrid encapsulating the Sb nanorods into highly conductive N and S codoped carbon (Sb@(N, S-C)) frameworks. As an anode for SIBs, the Sb@(N, S-C) hybrid maintains high reversible capacities of 621.1 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 150 cycles, and 390.8 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 1000 cycles. At higher current densities of 2, 5, and 10 A g-1, the Sb@(N, S-C) hybrid also can display high reversible capacities of 534.4, 430.8, and 374.7 mAh g-1, respectively. Such impressive sodium storage properties are mainly attributed to the unique cross-linked carbon networks providing highly conductive frameworks for fast transfer of ions and electrons, alleviating the volume expansion and preventing the agglomeration of Sb nanorods during the cycling.",

However, the large volume variation during electrochemical cycling makes it difficult to use for practical applications. Herein, the reversible performance of BP in SIB is significantly enhanced by bridging covalently functionalized BP on graphene. The enhanced interaction between the chemical functionalized BP and graphene improves the stability of BP during long-cycle running of SIB. The bridging reduces the surface energy and increases thickness of BP available for enlarging the channel between BP nanosheet and graphene. The enlarged channel stores more sodium ions for improving cycle performance. Significantly, two types of phosphorus-carbon bond are first detected during experimental analysis. Benefiting from the strategy, the BP-based SIB anode exhibits 1472 mAh g-1 specific capacity at 0.1 A g-1 in the 50th cycle and 650 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 200 cycles.",

The red phosphorus (RP) form has worse electronic conductivity and lower initial Coulombic efficiency than black phosphorus (BP), but high material cost and limited production capacity have slowed the development of BP anodes. To address these challenges, we have developed a simple and scalable method to synthesize layered BP/graphene composite (BP/rGO) by pressurization at room temperature.

In this paper, a safer sodium‐ion battery is proposed by introducing a nonflammable phosphate electrolyte (trimethyl phosphate, TMP) coupled with NaNi0.35Mn0.35Fe0.3O2 cathode and Sb‐based alloy anode. The physical and electrochemical compatibilities of the TMP electrolyte are investigated by igniting, ionic conductivity, cyclic voltammetry, and charge–discharge measurements. The results exhibit that the TMP electrolyte with FEC additive is completely nonflammable and has wide electrochemical window (0–4.5 V vs. Na/Na+), in which both the Sb‐based anode and NaNi0.35Mn0.35Fe0.3O2 cathode show high reversible capacity and cycling stability, similarly as in carbonate electrolyte. Based on these results, a nonflammable sodium‐ion battery is constructed by use of Sb anode, NaNi0.35Mn0.35Fe0.3O2 cathode, and TMP + 10 vol% FEC electrolyte, which works very well with considerable capacity and cyclability, demonstrating a promising prospect to build safer sodium‐ion batteries for large‐scale energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are expected to be a promising commercial alternative to lithium-ion batteries for grid electricity storage due to their potential low cost in the near future. Up to the present, the anode material still remains a great challenge for the application of SIBs, especially at room temperature. Graphite has an obvious limitation to store larger radius sodium ions (Na+) in comparison with lithium ions (Li+), while the hard carbon with large interlayer distance can demonstrate a relatively high storage capability and durable cycle life. However, the disadvantages of low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) mainly caused by large surface area and high cost synthetic approach hinder its practical applications. Herein, a new coupled carbonization strategy is presented to prepare a cost-effective hard carbon material by pyrolyzing and carbonizing the mixture of abundant sucrose and phenolic resin. Benefiting from the specialized pyrolysis reaction process and optimized conditions as studied in detail, the hard carbon has an extremely low surface area of 1.54 m2 g-1 and high initial Coulombic efficiency of 87%, which have been rarely reported before and enhance the utilization efficiency of Na+ consumption within the cathode in the future. More importantly, the hard carbon, with a high interlayer distance 3.95 Å, can deliver a higher capacity of 319 mAh g-1 and maintain a finer capacity retention of 90% over 150 cycles. Besides, a full cell with the configuration of as-prepared hard carbon anode versus an air-stable O3-Na0.9[Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48]O2 cathode is further presented, and it has a high ICE of 80% and energy density of 256 Wh kganode-1 (vs hard carbon) with reliable cycle performance.

        "abstract": "With the increasing use of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), developing cost-effective anode materials, such as metal oxide, for Na-ion storage is one of the most attractive topics. Due to the obviously larger ion radius of Na than that of Li, most metal oxide electrode materials fail to exhibit the same high performance for SIBs like that of Li-ion batteries. Herein, iron oxide was employed to demonstrate a concept that rationally designing an amorphous structure should be useful to enhance Na-ion storage performance of a metal oxide. Amorphous Fe2O3/graphene composite nanosheets (Fe2O3@GNS) were successfully synthesized by a facile approach as anodes for SIBs. It reveals that amorphous Fe2O3 nanoparticles with an average diameter of 5 nm were uniformly anchored on the surface of graphene nanosheets by the strong C-O-Fe oxygen-bridge bond. Compared to well-crystalline Fe2O3, amorphous Fe2O3@GNS exhibited superior sodium storage properties such as high electrochemical activity, high initial Coulombic efficiency of 81.2%, and good rate performance. At a current density of 100 mA/g, amorphous Fe2O3@GNS composites show a specific capacity of 440 mAh/g, which is obviously higher than the specific capacity of 284 mAh/g of crystalline Fe2O3. Even at a high current density of 2 A/g, amorphous Fe2O3@GNS composites still exhibit a specific capacity as high as 219 mAh/g. The excellent electrochemical performance should be attributed to the amorphous structures of Fe2O3 as well as strongly interfacial interaction between Fe2O3 and GNS, which not only accommodate more electrochemical active sites and provide the more transmission channels for sodium ions but also benefit electron transfer as well as effectively buffer the volume change of host materials during sodiation and desodiation. This concept for designing amorphous iron oxide anodes for SIBs is also expected to facilitate preparation of various amorphous nanostructure of other metal oxides and improve their Na-ion storage performance.",

Particularly, the FeP nanoparticles go through a refining-recombination process during the first cycle and present a global refining trend after dozens of cycles, which results in a gradually increase in graphitization degree and interface magnetization, and further provides more extra active sites for Na + storage and contributes to a rising capacity with cycling . The capacity ascending phenomenon can also extend to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). This paper holds a new feasibility insight mechanism of the enhanced capacity during cycling and also offers a feasible solution to design high performance anode material for SIBs/LIBs.",

        "abstract": "Graphene‐based nanomaterials have sprung up as promising anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries due to the intriguing properties of graphene itself and the synergic effect between graphene and active materials. However, the 2D graphene sheet only allows the rapid diffusion of sodium ions along the parallel direction while that of the vertical direction is difficult, limiting the rate capability of graphene‐based electrode materials. To tackle this problem, pore‐forming engineering has been employed to perforate graphene and concurrently achieve the in situ growth of Co3Se4 nanoparticles. The generation of in‐plane nanohole breaks through the physical barriers of the graphene nanosheets, enabling the fast diffusion of electrolyte ions in the longitudinal direction. In addition, this design limits the aggregation of Co3Se4 nanoparticles because of the high affinity of Co3Se4 on graphene. Benefiting from the high conductivity and fast ion transport bestowed by the ingenious architecture, the Co3Se4/holey graphene exhibits a remarkable rate performance of 519.5 mAh g−1 at 5.0 A g−1 and desirable cycle stability. Conclusions drawn from this investigation are that the transport of sodium inside the graphene‐based composites is crucial for rate performance enhancement and this method is effective in modifying graphene‐based nanomaterials as potential anode materials.",

Various solutions have been successfully applied to revolve the large-ion-size-induced battery issues at the mid-to-low current density range. However, the fast-charging properties of SIBs are still in high demand to accommodate the increasing energy needs at large to grid scales. Herein, a core-shell Co2VO4/carbon composite anode is designed to tackle the fast-charging problem of SIBs. The synergetic effect from the stable spinel structure of Co2VO4, the size of the nanospheres, and the carbon shell provide enhanced Na+ ion diffusion and electron transfer rates and outstanding electrochemical performance. With an ultrahigh current density of 5 A g-1, the Co2VO4@C anode achieved a capacity of 135.1 mAh g-1 and a >98% capacity retention after 2000 cycles through a pseudocapacitive dominant process.

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (NIB, NAB, SIB) are attracting interest as a potentially lower cost alternative to lithium ion batteries (LIB), with readily available and geographically democratic reserves of the metal. Tin is one of most promising SIB anode materials, which alloys with up to 3.75 Na, leading to a charge storage capacity of 847 mAh g(-1). In this Account, we outline the state-of-the-art understanding regarding the sodiation-induced phase transformations and the associated performance in a range of Sn-based systems, treating metallic Sn and its alloys, tin oxide (SnO2), tin sulfide (SnS2/SnS), and tin phosphide (Sn4P3). We first detail what is known about the sodiation sequence in metallic Sn, highlighting the most recent insight into the reactions prior to the terminal equilibrium Na15Sn4 intermetallic. We explain why researchers argue that the equilibrium (phase diagram) series of phase transitions does not occur in this system, and rather why sodiation/desodiation proceeds through a series of metastable crystalline and amorphous structures. We also outline the recent modeling-based insight regarding how this phase transition profoundly influences the mechanical properties of the alloy, progressively changing the bonding and the near neighbor arrangement from \"Sn-like\" to \"Na-like\" in the process. We then go on to discuss the sodiation reactions in SnO2. We argue that while a substantial amount of experimental work already exists where the focus is on synthesis and testing of tin oxide-based nanocomposites, the exact sodiation sequence is just beginning to be understood. Unlike in Sn and Sn alloys, where capacities near the theoretical are reached at least early during cycling, SnO2 never quite achieves anything close to the 1398 mAh g(-1) that would be possible with a combination of fully reversible conversion and alloying reactions. We highlight recent work demonstrating that contrary to general expectations, it is the Sn to Na15Sn4 alloying reaction that is incomplete and hence limits the capacity of the electrode. We also describe how the oxide conversion reaction goes through an intermediate SnO phase, and how its reversibility in a half-cell is highly dependent on the terminal anodic voltage. We then present what is known about sodiation of tin sulfide and of tin phosphide phases, including emerging microstructural evidence that may explain why both the sulfides and the phosphides are unable to achieve their highly promising theoretical capacities under conventional electrode testing conditions. Finally, we provide a broad comparison of the capacity (cycling and rate) performance for a range of Sn based anode materials, and show that there may be indeed an optimum microstructural architecture.",

However, it imposes stringent Na reversibility and high-voltage stability requirements on the electrolyte. Upon the request, a 3A zeolite molecular sieve film is rationally designed, and a highly aggregated solvation structure is constructed through the size effect. It successfully suppresses trace but continuous oxidative decomposition and extends the oxidative stability to 4.5 V without sacrificing the Na reversibility of the anode (99.91%). Therefore, we harvest anode-free cells with high energy density of 369 and 372 W h kg-1 for 4.0 and 4.25 V class cells, respectively.

First-principle calculations reveal that the Na2S/Na2Se interface possesses the lowest diffusion energy barrier (0.39 eV) of Na among three kinds of interface structures (Na2O/Na2S, Na2O/Na2Se, and Na2S/Na2Se) due to its smallest recorded interface deformation, similar electronegativity, and lattice constant.

However, the current researches of anode for SIBs still face the critical issues of low areal capacity, limited cycle life, and low initial coulombic efficiency for practical application perspective.

The assembled all‐flexible sodium‐ion battery delivers remarkable performance (high areal capacity of 1.42 mAh cm−2 at 0.3 mA cm−2 and superior energy density of 144 Wh kg−1), which are very close to the requirement of practical application.

Moreover, the benefits at deep-discharge conditions can be further promoted by an ultrathin Al2O3 coating. A series of measurements show that the OVs increase the electric conductivity and Na-ion diffusion coefficient, and the promotion from ultrathin coating lies in the effective reduction of cycling-induced solid-electrolyte interphase.

        "abstract": "Structural phase transitions can be used to alter the properties of a material without adding any additional elements and are therefore of significant technological value. It was found that the hexagonal-SnS2 phase can be transformed into the orthorhombic-SnS phase after an annealing step in an argon atmosphere, and the thus transformed SnS shows enhanced sodium-ion storage performance over that of the SnS2, which is attributed to its structural advantages. Here, we provide the first report on a SnS@graphene architecture for application as a sodium-ion battery anode, which is built from two-dimensional SnS and graphene nanosheets as complementary building blocks. The as-prepared SnS@graphene hybrid nanostructured composite delivers an excellent specific capacity of 940 mAh g(-1)and impressive rate capability of 492 and 308 mAh g(-1) after 250 cycles at the current densities of 810 and 7290 mA g(-1), respectively. The performance was found to be much better than those of most reported anode materials for Na-ion batteries. On the basis of combined ex situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and ex situ X-ray diffraction, the formation mechanism of SnS@graphene and the synergistic Na-storage reactions of SnS in the anode are discussed in detail. The SnS experienced a two-structural-phase transformation mechanism (orthorhombic-SnS to cubic-Sn to orthorhombic-Na3.75Sn), while the SnS2 experienced a three-structural-phase transformation mechanism (hexagonal-SnS2 to tetragonal-Sn to orthorhombic-Na3.75Sn) during the sodiation process. The lesser structural changes of SnS during the conversion are expected to lead to good structural stability and excellent cycling stability in its sodium-ion battery performance. These results demonstrate that the SnS@graphene architecture offers unique characteristics suitable for high-performance energy storage application.",

Here, we propose a new strategy to enable high-capacity utilization and cycle stability of hard carbon anodes in the nonflammable phosphate electrolyte by using low-cost Na+ salt with a high molar ratio of salt/solvent combined with an solid electrolyte interphase film-forming additive. As a result, the carbon anode in the trimethyl phosphate (TMP) electrolyte with a high molar ratio of [NaClO4]/[TMP] and 5% fluoroethylene carbonate additive demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 238 mAh g-1, considerable rate capability, and long-term cycling life with 84% capacity retention over 1500 cycles.

        "abstract": "Transition metal oxides can be considered as appealing candidates for sodium ion battery anode materials because these low-cost materials possess high capacity and enhanced safety. However, the practical application of these materials is usually limited by their low electronic conductivity and serious volume change during the charging-discharging process. Herein, we report the fabrication of 3D-0D graphene-Fe3O4 quantum dot hybrids by a facile one-pot hydrothermal approach as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Fe3O4 quantum dots with an average size of 4.9 nm are anchored on the surface of 3D structured graphene nanosheets homogeneously. Such unique hierarchical structure are advantageous for enlarging the electrode/electrolyte interface area and enhancing the electrochemical activity of the hybrid materials, inhibiting particle aggregation of Fe3O4 and accommodating their volume change during the charging-discharging process as well as enabling fast diffusion of electrons and rapid transfer of electrolyte ions. Consequently, the 3D-0D graphene-Fe3O4 quantum dot hybrids exhibit ultrahigh sodium storage capacity (525 mAh g-1 at 30 mA g-1), outstanding cycling stability (312 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles at 50 mA g-1) and superior rate performance (56 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1).",

        "abstract": "Electrochemical conversion reactions of metal oxides provide a new avenue to build high capacity anodes for sodium-ion batteries. However, the poor rate performance and cyclability of these conversion anodes remain a significant challenge for Na-ion battery applications because most of the conversion anodes suffer from sluggish kinetics and irreversible structural change during cycles. In this paper, we report an Fe2O3 single crystallites/reduced graphene oxide composite (Fe2O3/rGO), where the Fe2O3 single crystallites with a particle size of ∼300 nm were uniformly anchored on the rGO nanosheets, which provide a highly conductive framework to facilitate electron transport and a flexible matrix to buffer the volume change of the material during cycling. This Fe2O3/rGO composite anode shows a very high reversible capacity of 610 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1, a high Coulombic efficiency of 71% at the first cycle, and a strong cyclability with 82% capacity retention after 100 cycles, suggesting a potential feasibility for sodium-ion batteries. More significantly, the present work clearly illustrates that an electrochemical conversion anode can be made with high capacity utilization, strong rate capability, and stable cyclability through appropriately tailoring the lattice structure, particle size, and electronic conduction channels for a simple transition-metal oxide, thus offering abundant selections for development of low-cost and high-performance Na-storage electrodes.",

Excellent cycling stability is also observed at an even higher charge-discharge rate. A high reversible capacity of 149 mAh g(-1) also can be obtained at a current rate of 500 mA g(-1) (2C).

However, poor cycling stability, low rate capability and unclear electrochemical reaction mechanism are the main challenges for MoS2 anode in Na-ion batteries. In this study, molybdenum disulfide/carbon (MoS2 /C) nanospheres are fabricated and used for Na-ion battery anodes.

The high capacity is attributed to the short ion and electron diffusion pathway, which enables fast charge transfer and low concentration polarization. The stable cycling performance and high coulombic efficiency (∼100%) of MoS2 /C nanospheres are ascribed to (1) highly reversible conversion reaction of MoS2 during sodiation/desodiation as evidenced by ex-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and (2) the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer in fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) based electrolyte as demonstrated by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements.",

Transmission electron microscope images confirm that SnSb nanoparticles with an average size of about 20-30 nm are uniformly dispersed on the RGO surfaces. When they were used as anodes for rechargeable sodium (Na)-ion batteries, these as-synthesized RGO-SnSb nanocomposite anodes delivered a high initial reversible capacity of 407 mAh g(-1), stable cyclic retention for more than 80 cycles and excellent cycle stability at ultra high charge/discharge rates up to 30C. The significantly improved performance of the synthesized RGO-SnSb nanocomposites as Na-ion battery anodes can be attributed to the synergetic effects of RGO-based flexible framework and the nanoscale dimension of the SnSb alloy particles (<30 nm). Nanosized intermetallic SnSb compounds can exhibit improved structural stability and conductivity during charge and discharge reactions compared to the corresponding individuals (Sn and Sb particles). In the meantime, RGO sheets can tightly anchor SnSb alloy particles on the surfaces, which can not only effectively suppress the agglomeration of SnSb particles but also maintain excellent electronic conduction. Furthermore, the mechanical flexibility of the RGO phase can accommodate the volume expansion and contraction of SnSb particles during the prolonged cycling, therefore, improve the electrode integrity mechanically and electronically. All of these contribute to the electrochemical performance improvements of the RGO-SnSb nanocomposite-based electrodes in rechargeable Na-ion batteries.",

However, their formulation strongly depends on the solubility of the chosen salts, imposing a stringent restriction on the number of possible WiS systems. This issue becomes more severe for aqueous Na‐ion batteries (ANIBs) owing to the relatively lower solubility of sodium salts compared to its alkaline cousins (Li, K, and Cs). A new class of the inert‐cation‐assisted WiS (IC‐WiS) electrolytes containing the tetraethylammonium (TEA+) inert cation is reported. The Na IC‐WiS electrolyte at a superhigh concentration of 31 mol kg–1 exhibits a wide electrochemical window of 3.3 V, suppresses transition metal dissolution from the cathode, and ensures singular intercalation of Na into both cathode and anode electrodes during cycling, which is often problematic in mixed alkali cation systems such as K–Na and Li–Na. Owing to these unique advantages of the IC‐WiS electrolyte, the NaTiOPO4 anode and Prussian blue analog Na1.88Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.97·1.35H2O cathode can be coupled to construct a full ANIB, delivering an average voltage of 1.74 V and a high energy density of 71 Wh kg−1 with a capacity retention of 90% after 200 cycles at 0.25C and of 76% over 800 cycles at 1C.",

Here, comprehensive characterization, accompanied with density function theory (DFT) calculations, jointly expound the Na–K anode‐based battery working mechanism. With the organic cathode sodium rhodizonate dibasic (SR) that has negligible selectivity toward cations, the charge carrier is screened by electrolytes due to the selective ionic pathways in the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Stable cycling for this Na–K/SR battery is achieved with capacity retention per cycle to be 99.88% as a sodium‐ion battery (SIB) and 99.70% as a potassium‐ion battery (PIB) for over 100 cycles. Benefitting from the flexibility of the liquid metal and the specially designed carbon nanofiber (CNF)/SR layer‐by‐layer cathode, a flexible dendrite‐free alkali‐ion battery is achieved with an ultrahigh areal capacity of 2.1 mAh cm−2. Computation‐guided materials selection, characterization‐supported mechanistic understanding, and self‐validating battery performance collectively promise the prospect of a high‐performance, dendrite‐free, and versatile organic‐based liquid metal battery.",

The conventional SICs design is based on battery-like anode and capacitive cathode, in which the battery-like anode materials involve various reactions such as inserted reaction, alloying reaction and conversion reaction, and the capacitive cathode materials usually depend on activated carbon (AC). However, researchers attempted to construct SICs based on battery-like cathode and capacitive anode or a combination of both in recent years. Here, the charge storage mechanism and material design strategies in SICs are summarized, with a focus on battery-like anode materials from inorganic to organic materials. Additionally, the challenges in the fabrication of SICs and future research directions are discussed.",

        "abstract": "While sodium metal anodes (SMAs) feature many performance advantages in sodium ion batteries (SIBs), severe safety concerns remain for using bulk sodium electrodes. Herein, a 3D Ag@C natrophilic substrate prepared by a facile thermal evaporation deposition method, which can be employed as a much safer \"anode-free\" SMA, is reported. Initially, there is no bulk sodium on the Ag@C substrate in the assembled SIBs. Upon charging, sodium will be uniformly deposited onto the Ag@C substrate and afterwards functions as a real SMA, thus inheriting the intrinsic merits of SMA and enhancing safety simultaneously. While cycling, the as-synthesized substrate demonstrates superior sodium plating/stripping cycling stability at 1, 2 and 3 mA cm-2 with a capacity of 2 mAh cm-2 . Theoretical simulations reveal that Na ions prefer to bind with Ag and form a Na-Ag network, thus clearly revealing uniform sodium deposition on the Ag@C substrate. More importantly, a full battery based on Ag@C and Prussian white with impressive Coulomb efficiency (CE), high rate capability (from 0.1 C to 5 C) and long-term cycling life is illustrated for the first time, thus making Ag@C feasible for the establishment of \"anode-free\" SIBs with reduced cost, high gravimetric/volumetric energy density and enhanced safety.",

        "abstract": "Bismuth (Bi) have been demonstrated as promising anode for Na-ion batteries (NIBs) because it has high gravimetry (386 mAh g-1) and volumetric capacity (3800 mAh cm-3). However, Bi suffers from large volume expansion during sodiation, leading to poor electrochemical performance. Construction nanostructure with sufficient void space to accommodate the volume change has been proven effective for achieving prolonged cycling stability. But the excessive void space will definitely decrease the volumetric energy density of battery. Herein, we design an optimized Bi@Void@C nanospheres (Bi@Void@C-2) with yolk-shell structure that exhibits the best cycling performance and enhanced volumetric energy density. The optimized void space could not only buffer the volume change of the Bi nanosphere, but also could keep the high volumetric energy density of battery. The Bi@Void@C-2 shows an excellent rate capacity of 173 mAh g-1 at ultra-high current density of 100 A g-1 and long-cycle life (198 mAh g-1 at 20A g-1 over 10000 cycles). The origin of the superior performance is achieved through in-depth fundamental studies during battery operation using in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and in-situ transmission electron microscope (TEM), complemented by theoretical calculations and ex-situ TEM observation. Our rational design provides insights for anode materials with large volume variation, especially for conversion type and alloying type mechanism materials for batteries (i.e. Li-ion batteries, Na-ion batteries).",

        "abstract": "Rechargeable battery systems, including Li-ion batteries and Na-ion batteries, have attracted great interest in energy storage because of their high energy density, low cost, efficient energy storage and suitable redox potential. Nevertheless, their rapid development is still greatly hampered by some typical constraints including low coulombic efficiency, large volume changes and severe particle agglomeration and pulverization during the charge-discharge process. Here, we fabricate a few-layer MoSe2 confined within a ZnSe-C hollow porous sphere nanocomposite through a simple self-assembly strategy followed by selenization, which efficiently circumvents these problems. The fabricated ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode demonstrates diverse advantages, including the existence of a few-layer structure, an in situ porous carbon matrix, multicomponent coordination and excellent pseudocapacitive behavior. When used as an anode material, it displays extraordinarily attractive electrochemical performance for both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The reversible capacity of ZnSe/MoSe2@C for LIBs reaches as high as 1051 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 (150 cycles). A long-term high-rate cycling test reveals an excellent stability of 524 mA h g-1 at 4 A g-1 after 600 cycles. In addition, for SIBs, ZnSe/MoSe2@C also manifests a high initial coulombic efficiency of 89% at 0.2 A g-1 and a remarkable reversible capacity of 381 mA h g-1 at a high current density of 4 A g-1 even after 250 cycles with negligible capacity loss. This is one of the best performances of ZnSe-based anode materials for SIBs reported so far. The regulation strategy reported in the present work is expected to offer new insights into the fabrication of high performance anode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted considerable attention due to the intrinsic safety and high abundance of sodium. However, the lack of high-performance anode materials becomes a main obstacle for the development of SIBs. Here, we identify an ideal anode material, a metallic TiC3 monolayer with not only remarkably high storage capacity of 1278 mA h g-1 but also low barrier energy and open-circuit voltage, through first-principles swarm-intelligence structure calculations. TiC3 still keeps metallic after adsorbing two-layer Na atoms, ensuring good electrical conductivity during the battery cycle. Besides, high melting point and superior dynamical stability are in favor of practical application. Its excellent performance can be mainly attributed to the presence of an unusual n-biphenyl unit in the TiC3 monolayer. High cohesive energy, originating from multibonding coexistence (e.g., covalent, ionic, and metal bonds) in the TiC3 monolayer, provides strong feasibility for experimental synthesis. In comparison with TiC3, functionalized TiC3 with oxygen shows a higher storage capacity; meanwhile, it keeps nearly the same barrier energy. This is in sharp contrast with metal-rich MXenes. These intriguing properties make the TiC3 monolayer a promising anode material for SIBs.",

To make up for the lost sodium-ion, pre-sodiation treatments have been applied, which are effective ways to mitigate the low initial efficiency. Here, we developed a direct-contact method to achieve the pre-sodiation for cathode and anode electrodes and demonstrated the enhanced coulombic efficiency of the first cycle with improved cyclability and reversible capacity. Moreover, we proved the formation of a thick passivation layer at the cathode-electrolyte interface during the pre-sodiation process; this contributes to the improved cycle stability by preventing the dissolution of the active material and its deposition on the anode surface. The direct-contact method is a simple and cost-effective way to complete pre-sodiation, and this simple process will be widely applicable for practical battery manufacturing.",

        "abstract": "Metal sulfides show promise for use in alkali‐ion batteries because of their high theoretical capacities. However, their poor cycling stability and rate performance hinder their further development. To avoid these issues, In2S3 into Sb2S3 is introduced to improve its electrochemical properties by optimizing its crystal structure and sodium storage mechanism. A heterostructure composed of In2S3 and Sb2S3 shows a unique morphology of formicary microspheres, which provide abundant channels for fast transfer of sodium ions, large surface area for a high pseudocapacitance effect, and enough voids to relieve volume expansion. A sodium‐ion battery containing the bimetallic sulfide anode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 400 mA h g−1 and long cycle life of about 1000 cycles. Similarly, a high capacity of ≈610 mA h g−1 is achieved for a lithium‐ion battery containing the anode. During sodiation/desodiation, the synergistic effect of In2S3 and Sb2S3 enhances electronic conductivity and supports the host structure, preventing collapse. The cycling performance and rate performance of the In2S3–Sb2S3 anode are further improved by wrapping the electrode with carbon nanotubes.

The dimensions of the sheets ranged from nanometres to micrometres and these sheets were entangled with each other. These morphological features of rGO tend to facilitate the movement of guest ions larger than Li+. Impressive electrochemical properties were achieved with the rGO electrodes using various charge-transfer ions, such as Li+, Na+ and K+, along with high porosity.

        "abstract": "Potassium ion batteries (PIBs) are considered as promising alternatives to sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), which can be ascribed to the rich abundance of potassium resources, low cost and high safety. Currently, the development of anode materials for PIBs is still confronted with many serious problems, such as low capacity and poor cycling performance. In this work, sheet-like MoSe2 implanted on the surfaces of carbon nanofibers is successfully synthesized through a simple electrospinning and selenization route. MoSe2/C-700 (selenization at 700 °C) maintains high structural stability and facilitates the intercalation/deintercalation of K+, which benefits from one-dimensional nanofibers with good structural stability and MoSe2 with an expanded interlayer spacing. As a whole, MoSe2/C-700 as an anode for PIBs shows a high reversible capacity of 316 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 over 100 cycles. It also displays a specific capacity of 81 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 over 100 cycles when it first serves as an electrode material for nonaqueous potassium-based battery-supercapacitor hybrid (BSH) devices.",

Nb2 O5 is one typical model anode material with promising high-rate lithium storage.

In this work, partially surface-amorphized and defect-rich black niobium oxide@graphene (black Nb2 O5- x @rGO) nanosheets are designed to overcome the above Na/K storage problems. The black Nb2 O5- x @rGO nanosheets electrodes deliver a high-rate Na and K storage capacity (123 and 73 mAh g-1 , respectively at 3 A g-1 ) with long-term cycling stability. Besides, both Na-ion and K-ion full batteries based on black Nb2 O5- x @rGO nanosheets anodes and vanadate-based cathodes (Na0.33 V2 O5 and K0.5 V2 O5 for Na-ion and K-ion full batteries, respectively) demonstrate promising rate and cycling performance. Notably, the K-ion full battery delivers higher energy and power densities (172 Wh Kg-1 and 430 W Kg-1 ), comparable to those reported in state-of-the-art K-ion full batteries, accompanying with a capacity retention of ≈81.3% over 270 cycles.

Here we investigate an anode consisting of tin nanoparticles (SnNPs) with an ALD-Al2O3 coating. For the first time, in situ transmission electron microscopy unveiled the dynamic mechanical protection of the ALD-Al2O3 coating by coherently deforming with the SnNPs under the huge volume changes during charging/discharging. Battery tests in coin-cells further showed the ALD-Al2O3 coating remarkably boosts the cycling performance of the Sn anodes, comparing with those made of bare SnNPs. Chemomechanical simulations clearly revealed that a bare SnNP debonds and falls off the underlying substrate upon charging, and by contrast the ALD-Al2O3 coating, like ion-conductive nanoglue, robustly anchors the SnNP anode to the substrate during charging/discharging, a key to improving battery cycle performance.",

        "abstract": "Polymerization-induced phase separation of nanoparticle-filled solution is demonstrated as a simple approach to control the structure of porous composites. These composites are subsequently demonstrated as the active component for sodium ion battery anode. To synthesize the composites, we dissolved/dispersed titanium oxide (anatase) nanoparticles (for sodium insertion) and poly(hydroxybutyl methacrylate) (PHBMA, porogen) in furfuryl alcohol (carbon precursor) containing a photoacid generator (PAG). UV exposure converts the PAG to a strong acid that catalyzes the furfuryl alcohol polymerization. This polymerization simultaneously decreases the miscibility of the PHBMA and reduces the mobility in the mixture to kinetically trap the phase separation. Carbonization of this polymer composite yields a porous nanocomposite. This nanocomposite exhibits nearly 3-fold greater gravimetric capacity in Na-ion batteries than the same titanium oxide nanoparticles that have been coated with carbon. This improved performance is attributed to the morphology as the carbon content in the composite is five times that of the coated nanoparticles. The porous composite materials exhibit stable cyclic performance. Moreover, the battery performance using materials from this polymerization-induced phase separation method is reproducible (capacity within 10% batch-to-batch). This simple fabrication methodology may be extendable to other systems and provides a facile route to generate reproducible hierarchical porous morphology that can be beneficial in energy storage applications.",

For Na‐metal batteries, the crucial problem on metallic Na is one of the biggest challenges. Mossy or dendritic growth of Na occurs in the repetitive Na stripping/plating process with an unstable solid electrolyte interphase layer of nonuniform ionic flux, which can not only lead to the low Coulombic efficiency, but also can create short circuit risks, resulting in possible burning or explosion. In this communication, the atomic layer deposition of Al2O3 coating is first demonstrated for the protection of metallic Na anode for Na‐metal batteries. By protecting Na foil with ultrathin Al2O3 layer, the dendrites and mossy Na formation have been effectively suppressed and lifetime has been significantly improved. Furthermore, the thickness of protective layer has been further optimized with 25 cycles of Al2O3 layer presenting the best performance over 500 cycles. The novel design of atomic layer deposition protected metal Na anode may bring in new opportunities to the realization of the next‐generation high energy‐density Na metal batteries.",

The novel electrolyte combination developed here circumvents the dendritic Na deposition that is one of the primary concerns for battery safety and constructs the uniform ionic interlayer achieving highly reversible Na plating/stripping reactions. The FEC-NaFSI constructs the mechanically strong and ion-permeable interlayer containing NaF and ionic compounds such as Na2CO3 and sodium alkylcarbonates.",

        "abstract": "Developing advanced anodes for sodium ion batteries is still challenging. In this work, Fe-doped three-dimensional (3D) cauliflower-like rutile TiO2 was successfully synthesized by a facile hydrolysis method followed by a low-temperature annealing process. The influence of Fe content on the structure, morphology, and electrochemical performance was systematically investigated. When utilized as a sodium ion battery anode, 6.99%-Fe-doped TiO2 exhibited the best electrochemical performance. This sample delivered a very high reversible capacity (327.1 mAh g-1 at 16.8 mA g-1) and superior rate performance (160.5 mAh g-1 at 840 mA g-1), as well as long-term cycling stability (no capacity fading at 1680 mA g-1 over 3000 cycles). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with experimental results indicated that the significantly improved sodium storage ability of the Fe-doped sample should be mainly due to the increased oxygen vacancies, narrowed band gap, and lowered sodiation energy barrier, which enabled much higher electronic/ionic conductivities and more favorable sodium ion intercalation into rutile TiO2.",

For a DME/NaFSI ratio of 2, a stable passivation of anode materials was found owing to the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface, which was characterized spectroscopically. This permitted non-dentritic Na metal cycling with approximately 98 % coulombic efficiency as shown for up to 300 cycles. The NaFSI/DME electrolyte may enable Na-metal anodes and allows for more reliable assessment of electrode materials in Na-ion half-cells, as is demonstrated by comparing half-cell cycling of hard carbon anodes and Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 cathodes with a widely used carbonate and the NaFSI/DME electrolyte.",

        "abstract": "Engineering phosphorous anodes A focus of battery research has been the development of a range of lithium, sodium, and potassium cathodes, but improving anode materials is also an important goal. Silicon has shown some promise for replacing graphite because of its exceptional capacity, but the dramatic volume change during lithiation-delithiation processes often leads to failure. Jin et al. developed a composite that is made of black phosphorous and graphite in its core and covered with swollen polyaniline. In contrast to previous efforts, bonding between the carbon and phosphorous allows for a high charging rate without sacrifices in capacity and cycling stability. Science, this issue p. 192 Black phosphorus composites with engineered interfaces deliver high capacity, high rate capability, and long cycle life. High-rate lithium (Li) ion batteries that can be charged in minutes and store enough energy for a 350-mile driving range are highly desired for all-electric vehicles. A high charging rate usually leads to sacrifices in capacity and cycling stability. We report use of black phosphorus (BP) as the active anode for high-rate, high-capacity Li storage. The formation of covalent bonds with graphitic carbon restrains edge reconstruction in layered BP particles to ensure open edges for fast Li+ entry; the coating of the covalently bonded BP-graphite particles with electrolyte-swollen polyaniline yields a stable solid–electrolyte interphase and inhibits the continuous growth of poorly conducting Li fluorides and carbonates to ensure efficient Li+ transport. The resultant composite anode demonstrates an excellent combination of capacity, rate, and cycling endurance.",

ALD is known to improve the cycling performance, Coulombic efficiency of batteries, and maintain electrode integrity.

Given that ALD coatings are in the early stage of development for NIB cathode materials, little is known about how ALD coatings, in particular aluminum oxide (Al2O3), affect the electrode-electrolyte interface. Therefore, full characterizations of its effects are presented in this work. For the first time, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to elucidate the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on ALD-coated electrodes. It contains less carbonate species and more inorganic species, which allows for fast Na kinetics, resulting in significant increase in Coulombic efficiency and decrease in cathode impedance. The effectiveness of Al2O3 ALD coating is also surprisingly reflected in the enhanced mechanical stability of the particle which prevents particle exfoliation.",

In order to improve the cycle life of these batteries, it is crucial to understand and control the side reactions between the electrodes and the electrolyte. For potassium-oxygen batteries using ether-based electrolytes, the side reactions on the potassium anode have been identified as the main cause of battery failure. The composition of the side products formed on the anode, including some reaction intermediates, have been identified and quantified. Combined experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show the side reactions are likely driven by the interaction of potassium with ether molecules and the crossover of oxygen from the cathode. To inhibit these side reactions, the incorporation of a polymeric potassium ion selective membrane (Nafion-K(+)) as a battery separator is demonstrated that significantly improves the battery cycle life. The K-O2 battery with the Nafion-K(+) separator can be discharged and charged for more than 40 cycles without increases in charging overpotential.",

To compensate the poor internal conductivity of SnS-Sn nanoparticles, MCNTs are used to interweave SnS-Sn nanoparticles to improve the conductivity. Moreover, the designed three-dimensional carbon fiber conductive network can effectively shorten the diffusion path of electron/Na+, accelerate the reaction kinetics, and provide abundant active sites for sodium absorption.

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are regarded as a kind of promising candidate for large‐scale energy storage technology. The development of advanced carbon anodes with high Na‐storage capacity and initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) from low cost, resources abundant precursors is critical for SIBs. Here, a carbon microcrystalline hybridization route to synthesize hard carbons with extensive pseudo‐graphitic regions from lignite coal with the assistance of sucrose is proposed. Employing the cross‐linked interaction between sucrose and lignite coal to generate carbon‐based hybrid microcrystalline states, the obtained hard carbons possess pseudo‐graphitic dominant phases with large interlayer spaces that facilitate Na ion's storage and transportation, as well as fewer surface defects that guarantee high ICE. The LCS‐73 with an optimum cross‐link demonstrates the highest Na‐storage capacity of 356 mAh g−1 and an ICE of 82.9%. The corresponding full‐cell delivers a high energy density of 240 Wh kg−1 (based on the mass of anode and cathode materials) and excellent rate capability of 106 mAh g−1 at 10 C in addition to outstanding cycle performance with 80% retention over 500 cycles at 2 C. The proposed work offers an efficient route to develop high‐performance, low‐cost carbon‐based anode materials with potential application for advanced SIBs.",

Paired with biocompatible and biodegradable polypyrrole, this full battery system shows excellent sodium storage ability and flexibility, indicating its potential applications in wearable electronics and biointegrated devices.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries operating at room temperature have emerged as a generation of energy storage devices to replace lithium-ion batteries; however, they are limited by a lack of anode materials with both an adequate lifespan and excellent rate capability. To address this issue, we developed Nb2CTx MXene-framework MoS2 nanosheets coated with carbon (Nb2CTx@MoS2@C) and constructed a robust three-dimensional cross-linked structure. In such a design, highly conductive Nb2CTx MXene nanosheets prevent the restacking of MoS2 sheets and provide efficient channels for charge transfer and diffusion. Additionally, the hierarchical carbon coating has a certain level of volume elasticity and excellent electrical conductivity to guarantee the intercalation of sodium ions, facilitating both fast kinetics and long-term stability. As a result, the Nb2CTx@MoS2@C anode delivers an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 530 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 200 cycles and very long cycling stability with a capacity of 403 mA h g-1 and only 0.01% degradation per cycle for 2000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1. Moreover, this anode has an outstanding capacity retention rate of approximately 88.4% from 0.1 to 1 A g-1 in regard to rate performance. Most importantly, the Nb2CTx@MoS2@C anode can realize a quick charge and discharge at current densities of 20 or even 40 A g-1 with capacities of 340 and 260 mAh g-1, respectively, which will increase the number of practical applications for sodium-ion batteries.",

An exquisite hierarchical heterogeneous of bimetal sulfide Sb2S3@FeS2 hollow nanorods embedded into nitrogen-doped carbon matrix is fabricated by a concise two-steps of solvothermal method. The FeS2 interlayer bulges in-situ grow on the interface of hollow Sb2S3 nanorods within the nitrogen-doped graphene matrix, forming a delicate heterostructure. Such a well-designed architecture affords rapid Na+ diffusion and improves charge transfer at the heterointerfaces. Meanwhile, the strongly synergistic coupling interaction among the interior Sb2S3, interlayer FeS2, and external nitrogen-doped carbon matrix creates a steady nanostructure, which extremely accelerates the electronic/ion transport and effectively alleviates the volume expansion upon long cyclic process. As a result, the composite, as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries, exhibits superior rate capability of 537.9 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1, excellent cyclic stability with 85.7 % capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 5 A g-1. Based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculation, the existing constructing heterojunction in this composite can not only optimize the electronic structure to enhance the conductivity, but also favor the Na2S adsorption energy to accelerate the reaction kinetics.

The excellent performance is credited to the rapid Na+ and electron transport and higher material utilization derived from the synergistic effect of the expanded interlayer space and the higher electronic conductivity.

Nevertheless, they suffer from volume expansion, polyselenide dissolution, and sluggish kinetics, which lead to inadequate conversion reaction toward sodium and poor reversibility during the desodiation process. Therefore, the transition-metal selenides are far from long cycling stability, outstanding rate performance, and high initial Coulombic efficiency, which are the major challenges for practical application in SIBs. Here, an efficient anode material including an FeSe2 core and N-doped carbon shell with inner void space as well as high conductivity is developed for outstanding rate performance and long cycle life SIBs. In the ingeniously designed FeSe2@NC microrods, the N-doped carbon shell can facilitate mass transport/electron transfer, protect the FeSe2 core from the electrolyte, and accommodate volume variation of FeSe2 with the help of the inner void of the core. Thus, the FeSe2@NC microrods can maintain strong structural integrity upon long cycling and ensure a good reversible conversion reaction of FeSe2 during the discharge/charge process. As a result, the as-prepared FeSe2@NC microrods exhibit excellent sodium storage performance and ultrahigh stability, achieving an excellent rate capability (411 mAh g-1 at 10.0 A g-1) and a long-term cycle performance (401.3 mAh g-1 after 2000 cycles at 5.0 A g-1).",

However, the low Coulombic efficiency (CE) of the sodium metal plating/stripping process represents a serious issue for the Na anode, which hinders achieving higher energy density. Herein, we report that the Na+ solvation structure, particularly the type and location of the anions, plays a critical role in determining the Na anode performance. We show that the low CE results from anion-mediated corrosion, which can be tackled readily through tuning the anion interaction at the electrolyte/anode interface. Our strategy thus enables fast charging Na-ion and Na-S batteries with remarkable cycle-life. The presented insights differ from the prevailing interpretation that the failure mechanism mostly results from sodium dendrite growth and/or solid electrolyte interphase formation.

More significantly, the correlation between N dopants and interlayer distance of resultant N‐FLG‐T highlights the effect of pyrrolic N on the enlargement of graphene interlayer spacing, due to its stronger electrostatic repulsion.

        "abstract": "Developing anodes with high and stable energy density for both gravimetric and volumetric storage is vital for high-performance lithium/sodium-ion batteries. Herein, an SnSe/FLG (few-layer graphene) composite with high tap density (2.3 g cm-3) is synthesized via plasma milling method, in which SnSe nanoparticles are strongly bound with the FLG matrix, owing to both Sn-C and Se-C bonds, to form nanosized primary particles and then assemble to microsized secondary granules. The FLG can effectively alleviate the large stress generated from volume expansion of SnSe during cycling, based on its superstrength. Furthermore, as demonstrated by the density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, the Sn-C and Se-C co-bonding benefitting from the formation of substantial vacancy defects on the P-milling synthesized FLG enables strong affinity between SnSe nanoparticles and FLG matrix, preventing SnSe from aggregating and detaching even after long-term cycling. As anode for lithium-ion batteries, it exhibits high gravimetric and volumetric capacity (864.8 mAh g-1 and 1990 mAh cm-3 at 0.2 A g-1), high rate (612.6 mAh g-1 even at 5.0 A g-1) and the longest life among the reported SnSe-based anodes (capacity retention of 92.8% after 2000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1). Subsequently, impressive cyclic life (capacity retention of 91.6% after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1) is also achieved for sodium-ion batteries. Therefore, the SnSe/FLG composite is a promising anode for high-performance lithium/sodium-ion batteries.",

In this work, an elaborate composite, cobalt sulfide nanoclusters embedded in honeycomb-like sulfur-doped carbon foam (Co9S8@S-CF), is prepared via a facile sulfur-assisting calcination strategy, which tactfully induces the co-occurrence of in situ pore-forming, sulfidation, sulfur doping, and carbonization. Notably, sulfur-doped carbon foam (S-CF) possesses abundant voids, which are subject to construction of three-dimensional ionic/electronic pathways, leading to high sodium-ion accessibility and ultrafast sodium-ion/electron transportation toward Co9S8 nanoclusters. When worked as an anode in sodium-ion batteries, it delivers a remarkable capacity of 373 mA h g-1 over 1000 cycles at 0.25 C, achieving superior capacity retention of 80%.

However, limited cycle life and inferior rate capabilities still hinder their practical application. Improvement of the intrinsic conductivity by smart choice of elemental combination along with carbon coupling of the nanostructures may result in excellence of rate capability and prolonged cycling stability. Herein, a hierarchically porous binary transition metal selenide (Fe2CoSe4, termed as FCSe) nanomaterial with improved intrinsic conductivity was prepared through an exclusive methodology. The hierarchically porous structure, intimate nanoparticle–carbon matrix contact, and better intrinsic conductivity result in extraordinary electrochemical performance through their synergistic effect.

        "abstract": "Although studies of transition metal sulfides (TMS) as anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries are extensively reported, the short cycle life is still a thorny problem that impedes their practical application. In this work, a new capacity fading mechanism of the TMS electrodes is demonstrated; that is, the parasitic reaction between electrolyte anions (i.e., ClO4−) and metal sulfides yields non‐conductive and unstable solid‐electrolyte interphase (SEI) and meanwhile, corrosively turns metal sulfides into less‐active oxides. This knowledge guides the development of an electrochemical strategy to manipulate the anion decomposition and construct a stable interface that prevents extensive parasitic reactions. It is shown that introducing sodium nitrate to the electrolyte radically changes the Na+ solvation structure by populating nitrate ions in the first solvation sheath, generating a stable and conductive SEI layer containing both Na3N and NaF. The optimized interface enables an iron sulfide anode to stably cycle for over 2000 cycles with negligible capacity loss, and a similar enhancement in cycle performance is demonstrated on a number of other metal sulfides. This work discloses metal sulfides’ cycling failure mechanism from a unique perspective and highlights the critical importance of manipulating the interface chemistry in sodium‐ion batteries.",

Its nanoporous structure could accommodate the volume change and minimize the ion diffusion length, and the high electronic conductive network built on RGO sheets facilitates the fast electron and ion transportation. As a result, NPRP@RGO exhibits a superhigh capacity (1249.7 mAh gcomposite-1 after 150 cycles at 173.26 mA gcomposite-1), superior rate capability (656.9 mAh gcomposite-1 at 3465.28 mA gcomposite-1), and ultralong cycle life at 5.12 A gRP-1 for RP-based electrodes (775.3 mAh gRP-1 after 1500 cycles).

We further studied the sodium storage mechanism by different methods, especially the Na+ diffusivity coefficient ( DNa+) calculated by galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, which was more accurate. Interestingly, the trend of DNa+ coincides with cyclic voltammetry curves.

        "abstract": "The exploration of ideal electrode materials overcoming the critical problems of large electrode volume changes and sluggish redox kinetics induced by large ionic radius of Na+/K+ ions is highly desirable for sodium/potassium‐ion batteries (SIBs/PIBs) toward large‐scale applications. The present work demonstrates that single‐phase ternary cobalt phosphoselenide (CoPSe) in the form of nanoparticles embedded in a layered metal–organic framework (MOF)‐derived N‐doped carbon matrix (CoPSe/NC) represents an ultrastable and high‐rate anode material for SIBs/PIBs. The CoPSe/NC is fabricated by using the MOF as both a template and precursor, coupled with in situ synchronous phosphorization/selenization reactions. The CoPSe anode holds a set of intrinsic merits such as lower mechanical stress, enhanced reaction kinetics, as well as higher theoretical capacity and lower discharge voltage relative to its counterpart of CoSe2, and suppressed shuttle effect with higher intrinsic electrical conductivity relative to CoPS. The involved mechanisms are evidenced by substantial characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Consequently, the CoPSe/NC anode shows an outstanding long‐cycle stability and rate performance for SIBs and PIBs. Moreover, the CoPSe/NC‐based Na‐ion full cell can achieve a higher energy density of 274 Wh kg−1, surpassing that based on CoSe2/NC and most state‐of‐the‐art Na‐ion full cells based on P‐, Se‐, or S‐containing binary/ternary anodes to date.",

        "abstract": "We demonstrate that peat moss, a wild plant that covers 3% of the earth's surface, serves as an ideal precursor to create sodium ion battery (NIB) anodes with some of the most attractive electrochemical properties ever reported for carbonaceous materials. By inheriting the unique cellular structure of peat moss leaves, the resultant materials are composed of three-dimensional macroporous interconnected networks of carbon nanosheets (as thin as 60 nm). The peat moss tissue is highly cross-linked, being rich in lignin and hemicellulose, suppressing the nucleation of equilibrium graphite even at 1100 °C. Rather, the carbons form highly ordered pseudographitic arrays with substantially larger intergraphene spacing (0.388 nm) than graphite (c/2 = 0.3354 nm). XRD analysis demonstrates that this allows for significant Na intercalation to occur even below 0.2 V vs Na/Na(+). By also incorporating a mild (300 °C) air activation step, we introduce hierarchical micro- and mesoporosity that tremendously improves the high rate performance through facile electrolyte access and further reduced Na ion diffusion distances. The optimized structures (carbonization at 1100 °C + activation) result in a stable cycling capacity of 298 mAh g(-1) (after 10 cycles, 50 mA g(-1)), with ∼150 mAh g(-1) of charge accumulating between 0.1 and 0.001 V with negligible voltage hysteresis in that region, nearly 100% cycling Coulombic efficiency, and superb cycling retention and high rate capacity (255 mAh g(-1) at the 210th cycle, stable capacity of 203 mAh g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1)).",

Not only can such unique porous crystal Si/amorphous SiO2 nanoparticles uniformly dispersed in the OMC matrix mitigate the volume change of active materials during the cycling process, but they can also improve electrical conductivity of Si/SiO2 and facilitate the Li+ /Na+ diffusion. When applied as an anode for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the Si/SiO2 -OMC composite displayed superior reversible capacity (958 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 100 cycles) and good cycling life (retaining a capacity of 459 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1 after 1000 cycles). For sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), the composite maintained a high capacity of 423 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.05 A g-1 and an extremely stable reversible capacity of 190 mA h g-1 was retained even after 500 cycles at 1 A g-1 .

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) attract more attention because of sodium's abundant availability, affordable price, and potential to be an effective anode material. Meanwhile, carbon-based materials provide the most promising anode materials. Because of the large radius of sodium ions, SIBs do not exhibit favorable electrochemical performance. Introducing heteroatoms into the carbon-lattice is an effective strategy to enlarge the interlayer space of carbon-based materials which can improve carbon's electrochemical performance. In addition, anode materials with a surface-induced capacitive process can enhance the SIB's electrochemical performance because its capacitive process increases the kinetics of ion diffusion. Here, we describe an SIB's anode material containing nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene sheets [denoted as poly(2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole) (PDMcT)/reduced graphene oxide (RGO)] which are synthesized via carbonization of PDMcT polymerized on the surface of GO. PDMcT/RGO exhibited high capacities (240 mA h g-1 at 500 mA g-1), improved rate performance (144 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1), and good cycling stability (153 mA h g-1 after 5000 cycles at 5000 mA g-1). These unique results are attributed to the enlarged interlayer spacing and electronic conductivity from the heteroatoms which facilitate the sodium ion's insertion and electron transport. These results represent that PDMcT/RGO is a great potential anode material for SIBs.",

There are many SIB cathode materials under investigation but only a few candidate materials such as carbon, oxides and alloys were proposed as anodes. Among these anode materials, hard carbon shows promising performances with low operating potential and relatively high specific capacity. Unfortunately, its low initial coulombic efficiency and high cost limit its commercial applications. In this study, low-cost maple tree-biomass-derived hard carbon is tested as the anode for sodium-ion batteries. The capacity of hard carbon prepared at 1400 °C (HC-1400) reaches 337 mAh/g at 0.1 C. The initial coulombic efficiency is up to 88.03% in Sodium trifluoromethanesulfonimide (NaTFSI)/Ethylene carbonate (EC): Diethyl carbonate (DEC) electrolyte. The capacity was maintained at 92.3% after 100 cycles at 0.5 C rates. The in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that no peak shift occurred during charge/discharge, supporting a finding of no sodium ion intercalates in the nano-graphite layer.

However, anodes with long cycle life and large reversible capacities are still lacking and therefore limiting the development of SIBs. Here, a bulk Bi anode with surprisingly high Na storage performance in combination with glyme‐based electrolytes is reported. This study shows that the bulk Bi electrode is gradually developed into a porous integrity during initial cycling, which is totally different from that in carbonate‐based electrolytes and ensures facile Na+ transport and structural stability. The achievable capacity of bulk Bi in the NaPF6‐diglyme electrolyte is high up to 400 mAh g−1, and the capacity retention is 94.4% after 2000 cycles, corresponding to a capacity loss of 0.0028% per cycle. It exhibits two flat discharge/charge plateaus at 0.67/0.77 and 0.46/0.64 V, ascribed to the typical two‐phase reactions of Bi ↔ NaBi and NaBi ↔ Na3Bi, respectively. The excellent performance is attributed to the unique porous integrity, stable solid electrolyte interface, and good electrode wettability of glymes.

        "abstract": "Transition metal phosphides have been extensively investigated owing to their high theoretical capacities and relatively low intercalation potentials vs Li/Li+, but their practical applications have been hindered by low electrical conductivity and dramatic volume variation during cycling. In this work, an interesting strategy for the rational design of graphene (GR) encapsulated with a hollow FeP@carbon nanocomposite (H-FeP@C@GR) via a combination of a hydrothermal route, a carbon-coating process, phosphidation treatment, and carbothermic reaction is reported. The hollow FeP (H-FeP) nanospheres shelled with thin carbon layers are wonderfully incorporated into the GR matrix, interconnecting to form a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical architecture. Such a design offers distinct advantages for FeP-based anode materials for both lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium ion batteries (SIBs). For example, the 3D omnibearing conductive networks from the GR skeleton and outer coating carbon can provide an open freeway for electron/ion transport, promoting the electrode reaction kinetics. In addition, the wrapping of an H-FeP nanosphere in a thin carbon layer enables the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the carbon layer surface instead of on the individual H-FeP surface, preventing the continual re-forming of the SEI. When used as anode materials for LIBs and SIBs, H-FeP@C@GR exhibited excellent electrochemistry performances.",

        "abstract": "MnFe2O4 nanodots (∼3.3 nm) homogeneously dispersed in porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (denoted as MFO@C) were prepared by a feasible electrospinning technique. Meanwhile, MFO@C with the character of flexible free-standing membrane was directly used as binder- and current collector-free anode for sodium-ion batteries, exhibiting high electrochemical performance with high-rate capability (305 mA h g(-1) at 10000 mA g(-1) in comparison of 504 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1)) and ultralong cycling life (ca. 90% capacity retention after 4200 cycles). The Na-storage mechanism was systematically studied, revealing that MnFe2O4 is converted into metallic Mn and Fe after the first discharge (MnFe2O4 + 8Na(+) + 8e(-) → Mn + 2Fe + 4Na2O) and then to MnO and Fe2O3 during the following charge (Mn + 2Fe + 4Na2O → MnO + Fe2O3 + 8Na(+) + 8e(-)). The subsequent cycles occur through reversible redox reactions of MnO + Fe2O3 + 8Na(+) + 8e(-) ↔ Mn + 2Fe + 4Na2O, of which the reduction/oxidation of MnO/Mn takes place at a lower potential than that of Fe2O3/Fe. Furthermore, a soft package sodium-ion full battery with MFO@C anode and Na3V2(PO4)2F3/C cathode was assembled, delivering a stable capacity of ∼400 mA h g(-1) for MFO@C (with 100 cycles at 500 mA g(-1)) and a promising energy density of 77.8 Wh kg(-1) for the whole battery. This is owing to the distinctive structure of very-fine MnFe2O4 nanodots embedded in porous N-doped carbon nanofibers, which effectively improves the utilization rate of active materials, facilitates the transportation of electrons and Na(+) ions, and prevents the particle pulverization/agglomeration upon prolonged cycling.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries offer an attractive option for potential low cost and large scale energy storage due to the earth abundance of sodium. Red phosphorus is considered as a high capacity anode for sodium-ion batteries with a theoretical capacity of 2596 mAh/g. However, similar to silicon in lithium-ion batteries, several limitations, such as large volume expansion upon sodiation/desodiation and low electronic conductance, have severely limited the performance of red phosphorus anodes. In order to address the above challenges, we have developed a method to deposit red phosphorus nanodots densely and uniformly onto reduced graphene oxide sheets (P@RGO) to minimize the sodium ion diffusion length and the sodiation/desodiation stresses, and the RGO network also serves as electron pathway and creates free space to accommodate the volume variation of phosphorus particles. The resulted P@RGO flexible anode achieved 1165.4, 510.6, and 135.3 mAh/g specific charge capacity at 159.4, 31878.9, and 47818.3 mA/g charge/discharge current density in rate capability test, and a 914 mAh/g capacity after 300 deep cycles in cycling stability test at 1593.9 mA/g current density, which marks a significant performance improvement for red phosphorus anodes for sodium-ion chemistry and flexible power sources for wearable electronics.",

        "abstract": "Hydrazine-reduced graphite oxide and graphene oxide were synthesized to compare their performances as anode materials in lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries. Reduced graphite oxide inherits the layer structure of graphite, with an average spacing between neighboring layers (d-spacing) of 0.374 nm; this exceeds the d-spacing of graphite (0.335 nm). The larger d-spacing provides wider channels for transporting lithium ions and sodium ions in the material. We showed that reduced graphite oxide as an anode in lithium-ion batteries can reach a specific capacity of 917 mA h g-1, which is about three times of 372 mA h g-1, the value expected for the LiC6 structures on the electrode. This increase is consistent with the wider d-spacing, which enhances lithium intercalation and de-intercalation on the electrodes. The electrochemical performance of the lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries with reduced graphite oxide anodes show a noticeable improvement compared to those with reduced graphene oxide anodes. This improvement indicates that reduced graphite oxide, with larger interlayer spacing, has fewer defects and is thus more stable. In summary, we found that reduced graphite oxide may be a more favorable form of graphene for the fabrication of electrodes for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries and other energy storage devices.",

Besides the high working plateau at 2.1 V, another one is observed at approximately 0.4 V for the first time due to further reduction of Ti(3+) to Ti(2+). Remarkably, the anode exhibits superior rate capability, whose capacity and corresponding capacity retention reach 56 mAh g(-1) and 68%, respectively, over 10000 cycles under the high current density of 20 C rate (4 A g(-1)).

In this study, we designed few-layered MoS2/C nanoflowers with expanded interspacing of MoS2-MoS2 planes using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as an intercalating reagent and a carbon precursor.

However, the low power and low capacity of conventional sodium anodes hinder their practical realization. Although most research has concentrated on the development of high-capacity sodium anodes, anodes with a combination of high power and high capacity have not been widely realized. Herein, we present a simple microwave irradiation technique for obtaining few-layered, ultrathin two-dimensional SnS2 over graphene sheets in a few minutes. SnS2 possesses a large number of active surface sites and exhibits high-capacity, rapid sodium ion storage kinetics induced by quick, nondestructive pseudocapacitance. Enhanced sodium ion storage at a high current density (12 A g-1), accompanied by high reversibility and high stability, was demonstrated. Additionally, a rationally designed sodium ion full cell coupled with SnS2//Na3V2(PO4)3 exhibited exceptional performance with high initial Coulombic efficiency (99%), high capacity, high stability, and a retention of ∼53% of the initial capacity even after the current density was increased by a factor of 140. In addition, a high specific energy of ∼140 Wh kg-1 and an ultrahigh specific power of ∼8.3 kW kg-1 (based on the mass of both the anode and cathode) were observed. Because of its outstanding performance and rapid synthesis, few-layered SnS2 could be a promising candidate for practical realization of high-power SIBs.",

        "title": "Flower-like MoSe2 /C Composite with Expanded (0 0 2) Planes of Few-layer MoSe2 as the Anode for High-Performance Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have caught considerable attention in last few years owing to the abundance of sodium in comparison to lithium. The commercial graphite anode is demonstrated unsuitable as an anode material for SIBs due to the larger radius of Na+ ions, whereas the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) show great potential as anodes for SIBs because of their high achievable capacity. The sluggish kinetics, large volume expansion, and aggregation of those materials however results in severe decay of the electrochemical performance. In this work, a flower-like MoSe2 /C composite is synthesized with ethylenediamine and cassava starch (denoted as MoSe2 /Ccas ) and designed based on these principles: 1) expand the d-spacing of (0 0 2) planes of MoSe2 to enhance the kinetics for the intercalation-deintercalation of Na+ ions and 2) embed MoSe2 into the carbon matrix to enhance the conductivity and restrict the volume expansion and aggregation of MoSe2 . As a result, MoSe2 /Ccas exhibits superior cycle performance and rate capability for sodium storage. It shows durable long-life cycle capability with a reversible capacity of 360 mAh g-1 after 350 cycles at 0.5 Ag-1 . At the current density of 4 Ag-1 , the reversible capacity is still maintained at 266 mAh g-1 .",

        "abstract": "The design of sodium ion batteries is proposed based on the use of flexible membrane composed of ultrasmall transition metal oxides. In this paper, the preparation of CuO quantum dots (≈2 nm) delicately embedded in carbon nanofibers (denoted as 2-CuO@C) with a thin film via a feasible electrospinning method is reported. The CuO content can be controlled by altering the synthetic conditions and is optimized to 54 wt%. As binder-free anode for sodium ion batteries, 2-CuO@C delivers an initial reversible capacity of 528 mA h g-1 at the current density of 100 mA g-1 , an exceptional rate capability of 250 mA h g-1 at 5000 mA g-1 , and an ultra-stable capacity of 401 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 500 mA g-1 . The enhancement of electrochemical performance is attributed to the unique structure of 2-CuO@C, which offers a variety of advantages: highly conductive carbon matrix suppressing agglomeration of CuO grains, interconnected nanofibers ensuring short transport length for electrons, well-dispersed CuO quantum dots leading to highly utilization rate, and good mechanical properties resulting in strong electrode integrity.",

Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of intermetallic Fe-Sb alloy anode for SIBs via a high-throughput and industrially viable melt-spinning process. The earth-abundant and low-cost Fe-Sb-based alloy anode exhibits excellent cycling stability with nearly 466 mAh g-1 sodiation capacity at a specific current of 50 mA g-1 with 95% capacity retention after 80 cycles. Moreover, the alloy anode displayed outstanding rate performance with ∼300 mAh g-1 sodiation capacity at 1 A g-1. The crystalline features of the melt-spun fibers aid in the exceptional electrochemical performance of the alloy anode. Further, the feasibility of the alloy anode for real-life applications was demonstrated in a sodium-ion full-cell configuration which could deliver a sodiation capacity of over 300 mAh g-1 (based on anode) at 50 mA g-1 with more than 99% Coulombic efficiency.

Among all proposed anode materials for SIBs, red phosphorus (P) is a very promising candidate because it has the highest theoretical capacity (∼2600 mAh/g). In this study, a red P-single-walled carbon nanotube (denoted as red P-SWCNT) composite, in which red P is uniformly distributed between tangled SWCNTs bundles, is fabricated by a modified vaporization-condensation method. Benefiting from the nondestructive preparation process, the highly conductive and mechanically strong SWCNT network is preserved, which enhances the conductivity of the composite and stabilizes the solid electrolyte interphase. As a result, the red P-SWCNT composite presents a high overall sodium storage capacity (∼700 mAh/gcomposite at 50 mA/gcomposite), fast rate capability (∼300 mAh/gcomposite at 2000 mA/gcomposite), and stable long-term cycling performance with 80% capacity retention after 2000 sodiation-desodiation cycles. The red P-SWCNT composite fabricated by the vaporization-condensation method significantly extends the cycling stability of P/carbon composite from current ∼100 cycles to ∼2000 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Banana peel pseudographite (BPPG) offers superb dual functionality for sodium ion battery (NIB) and lithium ion battery (LIB) anodes. The materials possess low surface areas (19-217 m(2) g(-1)) and a relatively high electrode packing density (0.75 g cm(-3) vs ∼1 g cm(-3) for graphite). Tested against Na, BPPG delivers a gravimetric (and volumetric) capacity of 355 mAh g(-1) (by active material ∼700 mAh cm(-3), by electrode volume ∼270 mAh cm(-3)) after 10 cycles at 50 mA g(-1). A nearly flat ∼200 mAh g(-1) plateau that is below 0.1 V and a minimal charge/discharge voltage hysteresis make BPPG a direct electrochemical analogue to graphite but with Na. A charge capacity of 221 mAh g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1) is degraded by 7% after 600 cycles, while a capacity of 336 mAh g(-1) at 100 mAg(-1) is degraded by 11% after 300 cycles, in both cases with ∼100% cycling Coulombic efficiency. For LIB applications BPPG offers a gravimetric (volumetric) capacity of 1090 mAh g(-1) (by material ∼2200 mAh cm(-3), by electrode ∼900 mAh cm(-3)) at 50 mA g(-1). The reason that BPPG works so well for both NIBs and LIBs is that it uniquely contains three essential features: (a) dilated intergraphene spacing for Na intercalation at low voltages; (b) highly accessible near-surface nanopores for Li metal filling at low voltages; and (c) substantial defect content in the graphene planes for Li adsorption at higher voltages. The <0.1 V charge storage mechanism is fundamentally different for Na versus for Li. A combination of XRD and XPS demonstrates highly reversible Na intercalation rather than metal underpotential deposition. By contrast, the same analysis proves the presence of metallic Li in the pores, with intercalation being much less pronounced.",

Due to its low raw material cost, non-toxicity and potentially high charge-storage capacity pyrite (FeS2) is a highly promising material for such next-generation batteries. In this work we present the electrochemical performance of FeS2 nanocrystals (NCs) as lithium-ion and sodium-ion storage materials. First, we show that nanoscopic FeS2 is a promising lithium-ion cathode material, delivering a capacity of 715 mA h g(-1) and average energy density of 1237 Wh kg(-1) for 100 cycles, twice higher than for commonly used LiCoO2 cathodes. Then we demonstrate, for the first time, that FeS2 NCs can serve as highly reversible sodium-ion anode material with long cycling life. As sodium-ion anode material, FeS2 NCs provide capacities above 500 mA h g(-1) for 400 cycles at a current rate of 1000 mA g(-1). In all our tests and control experiments, the performance of chemically synthesized nanoscale FeS2 clearly surpasses bulk FeS2 as well as large number of other nanostructured metal sulfides.",

WS2 NWs with very thin diameter of ≈25 nm and expanded interlayer spacing of 0.83 nm were prepared by using a facile solvothermal method followed by a heat treatment. The as-prepared WS2 NWs were evaluated as anode materials of SIBs in two potential windows of 0.01-2.5 V and 0.5-3 V. WS2 NWs displayed a remarkable capacity (605.3 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) ) but with irreversible conversion reaction in the potential window of 0.01-2.5 V. In comparison, WS2 NWs showed a reversible intercalation mechanism in the potential window of 0.5-3 V, in which the nanowire-framework is well maintained. In the latter case, the interlayers of WS2 are gradually expanded and exfoliated during repeated charge-discharge cycling. This not only provides more active sites and open channels for the intercalation of Na(+) but also facilitates the electronic and ionic diffusion. Therefore, WS2 NWs exhibited an ultra-long cycle life with high capacity and rate capability in the potential window of 0.5-3 V. This study shows that WS2 NWs are promising as the anode materials of room-temperature SIBs.",

When tested as an anode for sodium ion batteries, the material delivered a high reversible capacity of 835.3 mA h g(-1) at 50 mA g(-1) after 50 cycles and maintained a capacity of 641.7 mA h g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles.

The additive used facilitates the controlled release of the reactant to form uniform, shaped nanosheets and an optimum reaction time allows the nanosheets to self-assemble into micro-flowers.",

        "abstract": "Designed as a high-capacity, high-rate, and long-cycle life anode for sodium ion batteries, exfoliated-SnS2 restacked on graphene is prepared by the hydrolysis of lithiated SnS2 followed by a facile hydrothermal method. Structural and morphological characterizations demonstrate that ultrasmall SnS2 nanoplates (with a typical size of 20-50 nm) composed of 2-5 layers are homogeneously decorated on the surface of graphene, while the hybrid structure self-assembles into a three-dimensional (3D) network architecture. The obtained SnS2/graphene nanocomposite delivers a remarkable capacity as high as 650 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 200 mA g(-1). More impressively, the capacity can reach 326 mA h g(-1) even at 4000 mA g(-1) and remains stable at ∼610 mA h g(-1) without fading up to 300 cycles when the rate is brought back to 200 mA g(-1). The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the synergetic effects between the ultrasmall SnS2 and the highly conductive graphene network. The unique structure can simultaneously facilitate Na(+) ion diffusion, provide more reaction sites, and suppress aggregation and volume fluctuation of the active materials during prolonged cycling.",

        "abstract": "Heteroatom incorporation can effectively suppress the phase transition of layered sodium-ion battery cathode, but heteroatom behaviors during operating conditions are not completely understood at the atomic scale. Here, density functional theory calculations are combined with experiments to explore the mitigation behavior of Mg dopant and its mechanisms under operating conditions in P2-Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2. The void formed by Na extraction will pump some Mg dopants into Na layers from TM layers, and the collective diffusion of more than one Mg ion most likely occurs when the Mg content is relatively high in the TM layer, finally aggregating to form Mg-enrich regions (i.e., Mg segregation) apart from Ni vacancies. The void-pump-effect-induced Mg segregation effectively suppresses the P2-O2 phase transition owing to the stronger Mg-O electrostatic attraction that enhances the integrate of two adjacent oxygen layers and prevents the crack growth by mitigating the lattice volume variation under high-voltage cycling. Our work provides a fundamental understanding of heteroatom mitigation behavior in layered cathodes at the atomic level for next-generation energy storage technologies.",

        "abstract": "P2-type layered oxides based on the elements Fe and Mn have attracted great interest as sodium ion battery (SIB) cathode materials owing to their inexpensive metal constituents and high specific capacity. However, they suffer from rapid capacity fading and complicated phase transformations. In this study, we modulate the crystal structure and optimize the electrochemical performances of Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.5O2 by Al doping for Mn or Fe, respectively, and the roles of Al in the enhancement of the rate capability and cycling performance are unraveled. (1) The substitution of Al for Mn or Fe decreases the lattice parameters a and c but enlarges d spacing and lengthens Na-O bonds, which enhances Na+ diffusion and rate capability especially for Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.47Al0.03O2. (2) Al doping reduces the thickness of TMO2 and strengthens TM-O/O-O bonding. This enhances the layered structure stability and the capacity retention. (3) Al doping mitigates Mn3+ and Jahn-Teller distortion, mitigating the irreversible phase transition. (4) Al doping also alleviates the lattice volume variation and the structure strain. This further improves the stability of the layered structure and the cycling performances particularly in the case of Al doping for Fe. The in-depth insights into the roles of Al substitution might be also useful for designing high-performance cathode materials for SIBs through appropriate lattice doping.",

        "abstract": "Layered O3-type sodium oxides (NaMO2 , M=transition metal) commonly exhibit an O3-P3 phase transition, which occurs at a low redox voltage of about 3 V (vs. Na+ /Na) during sodium extraction and insertion, with the result that almost 50 % of their total capacity lies at this low voltage region, and they possess insufficient energy density as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (NIBs). Therefore, development of high-voltage O3-type cathodes remains challenging because it is difficult to raise the phase-transition voltage by reasonable structure modulation. A new example of O3-type sodium insertion materials is presented for use in NIBs. The designed O3-type Na0.7 Ni0.35 Sn0.65 O2 material displays a highest redox potential of 3.7 V (vs. Na+ /Na) among the reported O3-type materials based on the Ni2+ /Ni3+ couple, by virtue of its increased Ni-O bond ionicity through reduced orbital overlap between transition metals and oxygen within the MO2 slabs. This study provides an orbital-level understanding of the operating potentials of the nominal redox couples for O3-NaMO2 cathodes. The strategy described could be used to tailor electrodes for improved performance.",

In this work, we have developed manganese oxide (α-MnO2) nanorods for SIB applications. The crystal structure, which is crucial for high-performance energy storage, is examined systematically for the metal oxide cathode. The intercalation of sodium into the α-MnO2 matrix was studied using the theoretical density functional theory (DFT) studies. The DFT studies predict Na ions’ facile diffusion kinetics through the MnO2 lattice with an attractively low diffusion barrier (0.21 eV). When employed as a cathode material for SIBs, MnO2 showed a moderate capacity (109 mAh·g–1 at C/20 current rate) and superior life cyclability (58.6% after 800 cycles) in NaPF6/EC+DMC (5% FEC) electrolyte. It shows a much higher capacity of 181 mAh·g–1 (C/20 current rate) in NaClO4/PC (5% FEC) electrolyte, though it suffers fast capacity fading (11.5% after 800 cycles). Our findings show that high crystallinity and hierarchical nanorod morphology of the MnO2 are responsible for better cycling performance in conjunction with fast and sustained charge-discharge behaviors.",

With respect to PB cathodes, however, their intrinsic crystal regularity, vacancies, and coordinated water will lead to low specific capacity and poor rate performance, impeding their application. Herein, nanocubic porous Nax FeFe(CN)6 coated with polydopamine (PDA) as a coupling layer to improve its electrochemical performance is reported, inspired by the excellent adhesive property of PDA. As a cathode for sodium-ion batteries, the Nax FeFe(CN)6 electrode coupled with PDA delivers a reversible capacity of 93.8 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 0.2 A g-1 , and a discharge capacity of 72.6 mA h g-1 at 5.0 A g-1 . The sodium storage mechanism of this Nax FeFe(CN)6 coupled with PDA is revealed via in situ Raman spectroscopy. The first-principles computational results indicate that FeII sites in PB prefer to couple with the robust PDA layer to stabilize the PB structure. Moreover, the sodium-ion migration in the PB structure is enhanced after coating with PDA, thus improving the sodium storage properties. Both experiments and computational simulations present guidelines for the rational design of nanomaterials as electrodes for energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "As a promising cathode material of sodium-ion battery, P2-type Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 (NNMO) possesses a theoretically high capacity and working voltage to realize high energy storage density. However, it still suffers from poor cycling stability mainly incurred by the undesirable P2-O2 phase transition. Herein, the electrochemically active Fe3+ ions are introduced into the lattice of NNMO, forming Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3- xFe xO2 ( x = 0, 1/24, 1/12, 1/8, 1/6) to effectively stabilize the P2-type crystalline structure. In such Fe-substituted materials, both Ni2+/Ni4+ and Fe3+/Fe4+ couples take part in the redox reactions, and the P2-O2 phase transition is well restrained during cycling, as verified by ex situ X-ray diffraction. As a result, the optimized Na2/3Ni1/3Mn7/12Fe1/12O2 (1/12-NNMF) has a long-term cycling stability with the fading rate of 0.05% per cycle over 300 cycles at 5 C. Furthermore, the 1/12-NNMF delivers excellent rate capabilities (65 mA h g-1 at 25 C) and superior low-temperature performance (the capacity retention of 94% at -25 °C after 80 cycles) owing to the enhanced Na diffusion upon Fe doping, which is deduced by the studies of electrode kinetics. More significantly, the 1/12-NNMF also displays remarkable sodium-ion full-cell properties when merged with an LS-Sb@G anode, thus implying the possibility of their practical application.",

In this work, we designed and fabricated a free-standing, binder-free Na2/3Fe1/2Mn1/2O2@graphene composite via a filtration process. The porous composite led to excellent electrochemical performance due to the facile transport for electrons and ions that was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at different temperatures.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been regarded as a promising candidate for large-scale renewable energy storage system. Layered manganese oxide cathode possesses the advantages of high energy density, low cost and natural abundance while suffering from limited cycling life and poor rate capacity. To overcome these weaknesses, layer-tunnel hybrid material was developed and served as the cathode of SIB, which integrated high capacity, superior cycle ability, and rate performance. In the current work, the doping of copper was adopted to suppress the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn3+ and to affect relevant structural parameters. Multifunctions of the Cu2+ doping were carefully investigated. It was found that the structure component ratio is varied with the Cu2+ doping amount. Results demonstrated that Na+/vacancy rearrangement and phase transitions were suppressed during cycling without sacrificing the reversible capacity and enhanced electrochemical performances evidenced with 96 mA h g-1 retained after 250 cycles at 4 C and 85 mA h g-1 at 8 C. Furthermore, ex situ X-ray diffraction has demonstrated high reversibility of the Na0.6Mn0.9Cu0.1O2 cathode during Na+ extraction/insertion processes and superior air stability that results in better storage properties. This study reveals that the Cu2+ doping could be an effective strategy to tune the properties and related performances of Mn-based layer-tunnel hybrid cathode.",

DFT calculations suggest that the intermediate phase, Na1.5 FePO4 F, adopts the space group of P21 /c, which is a subgroup (P21 /b11, No. 14) of Pbcn (No. 60), the space group of the starting phase, Na2 FePO4 F, and this space group provides a good fit to the experimental XRD and NMR results. The two crystallographically unique Na sites in the structure of Na2 FePO4 F behave differently during cycling, where the Na ions on the Na2 site are electrochemically active while those on the Na1 site are inert.

In this paper, vanadium hexacyanoferrate cathodes was firstly used for constructing rechargeable aqueous sodium-ion batteries (VHCF/WO3), and tested in the new-type electrolyte (NaP-4.6) consisting of polyethylene glycol (PEG)/H2O/NaClO4 electrolyte with a low H+ concentration (molar ratio of [H2O]:[Na+] is 4.6), which performs high stability at a high current density as high as 1000 mA g-1 with a capacity retention of 90.3% after 2000 cycles at high coulombic efficiency (above 97.8%). To understand the outstanding performance, the proton-assisted sodium ion storage mechanism and interphase chemistry of VHCF is investigated by solid-state NMR technology. It is suggested that H+ storage reaction is accompanied by the redox of vanadium atoms, and Na+-intercalation is accompanied by the redox of iron atoms. It is also observed that the complex of polyethylene glycol (PEG) with Na+ (PEG-Na+) exists on the VHCF surface which facilitates the stability of VHCF and promotes the alkali ion transfer at a high current density.

To elucidate the origin of TM migration in layered SIB cathodes, we choose NaCrO2, a typical layered cathode suffering from serious TM migration, as a model material and find that the TM migration is derived from the random desodiation and subsequent formation of Na-free layer at high charge potential. A Ru/Ti co-doping strategy is developed to address the issue, where the doped active Ru is first oxidized to create a selective desodiation and the doped inactive Ti can function as a pillar to avoid complete desodiation in Ru-contained TM layers, leading to the suppression of the Na-free layer formation and subsequent enhanced electrochemical performance.",

Oxygen redox reactions in layered oxide cathodes are proven to contribute additionally high specific capacity, while such cathodes often suffer from irreversible structural transitions, causing serious capacity fading and voltage decay upon cycling, and the formation process of the oxidized oxygen species remains elusive. Herein, a series of Al‐doped P2‐type Na0.6Ni0.3Mn0.7O2 cathode materials for SIBs are reported and the corresponding charge compensation mechanisms are investigated qualitatively and quantitatively. The combined analyses reveal that Al doping boosts the reversible oxygen redox reactions through the reductive coupling reactions between orphaned O 2p states in NaOAl local configurations and Ni4+ ions, as directly evidenced by X‐ray absorption fine structure results. Additionally, Al doping also induces an increased interlayer spacing and inhibits the unfavorable P2 to O2 phase transition upon desodiation/sodiation, which is common in P2‐type Mn‐based cathode materials, leading to the great improvement in capacity retention and rate capability.

Nevertheless, conventional layered compounds involve detrimental phase transformation throughout repeated cycles, which results in electrochemical performance degradation. Therefore, finding structurally stable layered compounds, featuring minimal phase transition has been a key theme of the sodium-ion battery research. Here lithium substituted Fe/Mn-based P2/O3 layered oxide-Na0.67 Li0.2 Fe0.2 Mn0.6 O2 -that overcomes the inherited structural instability, is reported. In situ synchrotron-based diffraction measurements and DFT calculations are utilized, in order to identify the association between P2/O3 biphasic structure and electrochemical performances. The lithium honeycomb ordering within the P2/O3 biphasic layered compound effectively constrains the undesirable phase transitions; more specifically, both P2-Z phase transition and Jahn-Teller distortion are suppressed throughout wide potential range of 1.5-4.5 V. The DFT calculation further discovers that the presence of honeycomb ordering is crucial for achieving the structural stability by forming Na-vac-Li and Na-Li-Na pairing at highly charged state. The results highlight that the synergetic effect of P2/O3 biphasic structure and lithium substitution can provide an effective strategy toward achieving electrochemically stable layered cathode material for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) show practical applications in large‐scale energy storage systems. But, their power density is limited by the sluggish Na+ diffusion into the cathode and anode materials. Herein, the authors demonstrate a prototype of ultrahigh power SIB, consisting of the high‐rate Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode, graphite‐type mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB) anode, and Na+‐diglyme electrolyte. It is found that the overpotential of the NVP cathode obeys the Ohmic rule. Thus, the as‐synthesized NVP@C@carbon nanotubes (CNTs) cathode with the high conductive CNTs networks displays high electronic conductivity, reducing the overpotential and charge transfer resistances and leading to the remarkable rate capability over 1000C. For the MCMB anode, the initial [Na‐diglyme]+ co‐intercalation step is pseudocapacitive dominated, and then the expanded graphite's layers ensure the subsequent fast ions diffusion. The rapid (de)intercalation kinetics in between the cathode and anode are well‐matched. Thus, the assembled MCMB|1 m NaPF6 in diglyme|NVP@C@CNTs full‐cell SIB delivers the energy density of 88 Wh kg−1 at the high power density of ≈10 kW kg−1. Even at the ultrahigh power density of 23 kW kg−1, an energy density of 58 Wh kg−1 is obtained. The encouraging results of the full cell will promote the development of high‐power SIB for large‐scale applications in the future.",

        "abstract": "As for sodium-ion battery cathodes, the structure evolution during cycling plays a vital role in their electrochemical performance. Herein, through a strategy for engineering the crystal structure coupled with chemical element substitution, we design a layered P2@P3 integrated spinel Na 0.5 Ni 0.1 Co 0.15 Mn 0.65 Mg 0.1 O 2 oxide cathode. This novel electrode shows excellent sodium-ion half/full battery performance due to the synergistic effects of its triphase intergrowth structure and cation substitution strategy. Based on combined analyses by scanning transmission electron microscopy with atomic resolution, as well as ex-situ synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectra and in-situ synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction patterns, the inherent layered P2@P3 integrated spinel structure, charge compensation mechanism, structural evolution, and phase transition are clearly articulated and confirmed. This study provides an in-depth understanding of the structure-performance relationship in this special structure and opens up a novel field via manipulating structural evolution for the design of high-performance battery cathodes.",

The reaction results in just a minor lattice contraction, and a broad intervalence charge-transfer band emerges, indicative of charge mobility. Although both metal- and ligand-based oxidations can be accessed, only the former were found to be fully reversible and, importantly, proceed stoichiometrically under both chemical and electrochemical conditions. Electrochemical measurements probing the effects of nanoconfinement on the insertion reaction revealed strong anion size and solvent dependences. Significantly, the anion insertion behavior of Fe2(dobpdc) enabled its use in the construction of a dual-ion battery prototype incorporating a sodium anode.

Creating air-stable and high-voltage layered cathodes for sodium-ion full batteries still remains a challenge.

The cathode displays a satisfactory working voltage of 3.6 V and excellent cyclic stability over 100 cycles at 1 C rate without obvious capacity fading. The results of ex-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) demonstrate that P3-type structure is well retained even charged to 4.4 V. Furthermore, the structural characterization by XRD Rietveld refinement, scanning electron microscope and electrochemical testing certify that the cathode maintains its structure commendably even when soaked in water for 12 h. In particular, the P3- Na2/3Ni1/4Mg1/12Mn2/3O2//hard carbon assembled for full battery exhibits a desired competitive high voltage of 3.45 V and an attractive energy density up to 412.2 Wh kg-1 based on the cathode.

        "abstract": "All-solid-state sodium ion batteries (ASIBs) based on sulfide electrolytes are considered a promising candidate for large-scale energy storage. However, the limited cycle life of ASIBs largely restricts their practical application. Cycling-stable ASIBs can be achieved only if the designed cathode can simultaneously address challenges including insufficient interfacial contact, electrochemical and chemical instability between the electrode and electrolyte, and strain/stress during operation , rather than just addressing one or part of these challenges. Chevrel phase Mo6S8 has inherent high electronic conductivity and small volume change during sodiation/desodiation, and is chemically and electrochemically stable with the sulfide electrolyte, and therefore the only challenge of using Mo6S8 as the cathode for ASIBs is the insufficient contact between Mo6S8 and the solid electrolyte (SE). Herein, a thin layer of SE is coated on Mo6S8 using a solution method to achieve an intimate contact between Mo6S8 and the SE. Such a SE-coated Mo6S8 cathode enabled an ASIB with a high cycling performance (500 cycles), even much better than that of the liquid-electrolyte batteries with the Mo6S8 cathode. This work provides valuable insights for developing long-cycle life ASIBs.",

Conventional electrolytes do not contribute to charge storage in battery systems, but redox-active electrolytes augment this property via charge transfer reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface. The capacity of the cathode combined with that provided by the electrolyte redox reaction thus increases overall charge storage. An aqueous sodium hexacyanoferrate (Na4 Fe(CN)6 ) solution is employed as the redox-active electrolyte (Na-FC) and sodium nickel Prussian blue (Nax -NiBP) as the Na+ ion insertion/de-insertion cathode. The capacity of DESIB with Na-FC electrolyte is twice that of a battery using a conventional (Na2 SO4 ) electrolyte.

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion battery has been considered as one of the most promising power sources for large‐scale energy storage systems due to its similar electrochemistry to the lithium‐ion battery and the crust abundance of Na resources. Essentially, developing low‐cost electrode materials along with a facile and economical synthesis procedure is critically important to promote the commercialization of sodium‐ion batteries. However, applicable cathode materials capable of being massively produced are still scarcely reported to date. Herein, a green and scalable synthesis approach is developed to obtain Na3Fe2(PO4)P2O7 (NFPP)/rGO composite by using FePO4 and Na3PO4 as the resources, during which all the atoms present in the starting materials end up in the product. The prepared Na3Fe2(PO4)P2O7/rGO cathode exhibits an ultralong cycle life (capacity retention of 72.4% after 8000 cycles at 20 C) and outstanding rate capability (42.4 mAh g−1 at 100 C).

Lithium could be selectively leached into solution using formic acid while aluminum remained as the metallic form, and most of the other metals from the cathode scrap could be precipitated out. This phenomenon clearly demonstrates that formic acid can be used for lithium recovery from cathode scrap, as both leaching and separation reagent. By investigating the effects of different parameters including temperature, formic acid concentration, H2O2 amount, and solid to liquid ratio, the leaching rate of Li can reach 99.93% with minor Al loss into the solution. Subsequently, the leaching kinetics was evaluated and the controlling step as well as the apparent activation energy could be determined. After further separation of the remaining Ni, Co, and Mn from the leachate, Li2CO3 with the purity of 99.90% could be obtained. The final solution after lithium carbonate extraction can be further processed for sodium formate preparation, and Ni, Co, and Mn precipitates are ready for precursor preparation for cathode materials. As a result, the global recovery rates of Al, Li, Ni, Co, and Mn in this process were found to be 95.46%, 98.22%, 99.96%, 99.96%, and 99.95% respectively, achieving effective resources recycling from cathode scrap of spent LIB.",

According to the systemical analysis of experimental results on this composite structure, it is found that N-doping not only increases Na-ion migration velocity across the carbon-coated layer but also improves the electric conductivity of the carbon layer. More importantly, the CNTs 3D conducting network could significantly accelerate the electron transport between multiple particles of Na3V2(PO4)3, due to the intimate contacts between active materials and CNTs.

For instance, its initial capacity of 94.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C decreases to 70 mAh g(-1) at 70 C, and the capacity retention is 74%. Moreover, when dischage rate increases to a higher 30 C, the capacity retention is still as high as 87% after 300 cycles.",

        "abstract": "The development of excellent performance of Na‐ion batteries remains great challenge owing to the poor stability and sluggish kinetics of cathode materials. Herein, B substituted Na3V2P3–xBxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) as stable cathode materials for Na‐ion battery is presented. A combined experimental and theoretical investigations on Na3V2P3–xBxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) are undertaken to reveal the evolution of crystal and electronic structures and Na storage properties associated with various concentration of B. X‐ray diffraction results indicate that the crystal structure of Na3V2P3–xBxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1/3) consisted of rhombohedral Na3V2(PO4)3 with tiny shrinkage of crystal lattice. X‐ray absorption spectra and the calculated crystal structures all suggest that the detailed local structural distortion of substituted materials originates from the slight reduction of V–O distances. Na3V2P3‐1/6B1/6O12 significantly enhances the structural stability and electrochemical performance, giving remarkable enhanced capacity of 100 and 70 mAh g−1 when the C‐rate increases to 5 C and 10 C. Spin‐polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that, as compared with the pristine Na3V2(PO4)3, the superior electrochemical performance of the substituted materials can be attributed to the emergence of new boundary states near the band gap, lower Na+ diffusion energy barriers, and higher structure stability.",

        "abstract": "NASICON-structured Na3V2(PO4)2F3 is considered as a potentially high-capacity cathode material for Na-ion batteries; however, its poor rate capability and insufficient cyclability remain a challenge for battery applications. To address this issue, we designed and successfully synthesized a core/double-shell structured Na3V2(PO4)2F3@C nanocomposite (Na3V2(PO4)2F3@CD) by in situ carbon coating and embedding the Na3V2(PO4)2F3 nanoparticles in ordered mesoporous carbon framework. Benefiting from the sufficient electrochemically available interfaces and abundant electronic/ionic pathways, this Na3V2(PO4)2F3@CD material demonstrated superior Na+-storage performance with a high reversible capacity of 120 mA h g-1 at a moderate current of 1 C, a strong high-rate capability with 63 mA h g-1 at an extremely high rate of 100 C, and a long-cycle lifespan with 65% capacity retention over 5000 cycles. These superior electrochemical performances remained stable when the Na3V2(PO4)2F3@CD cathode was used in a full cell, suggesting a promising application of the material for high rate and long lifespan sodium-ion batteries.

We demonstrate how a stretched exponential function permits us to systematically quantify the rate performance, which in turn reveals guidelines for the design of novel sodium-ion battery chemistries suitable for high power, grid-scale applications. Starting from a diffusion relaxation model, we establish a semi-quantitative prediction of the rate-performance of half-cells from the structure of the cathode material that factors in dimensionality of Na+ ion migration pathways, the height of the migration barriers and the crystallite size of the active material. With the help of selected examples, we also illustrate the respective roles of unoccupied low energy sites within the pathway and temperature towards the overall rate capability of insertion-type cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "The development of secondary batteries based on abundant and cheap elements is vital. Among various alternatives to conventional lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are promising due to the abundant resources and low cost of sodium. While there are many challenges associated with the SIB system, cathode is an important factor in determining the electrochemical performance of this battery system. Accordingly, ongoing research in the field of SIBs is inclined towards the development of safe, cost effective cathode materials having improved performance. In particular, pyrophosphate cathodes have recently demonstrated decent electrochemical performance and thermal stability. Herein, we report the synthesis, electrochemical properties, and thermal behavior of a novel Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 cathode for SIBs. The material was synthesized through a solid state process. The structural analysis reveals that the mixed substitution of manganese and iron has resulted in a triclinic crystal structure (P1[combining macron] space group). Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements indicate that Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 is electrochemically active with a reversible capacity of ∼80 mA h g(-1) at a C/20 rate with an average redox potential of 3.2 V. (vs. Na/Na(+)). It is noticed that 84% of initial capacity is preserved over 90 cycles showing promising cyclability. It is also noticed that the rate capability of Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 is better than Na2MnP2O7. Ex situ and CV analyses indicate that Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 undergoes a single phase reaction rather than a biphasic reaction due to different Na coordination environment and different Na site occupancy when compared to other pyrophosphate materials (Na2FeP2O7 and Na2MnP2O7). Thermogravimetric analysis (25-550 °C) confirms good thermal stability of Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 with only 2% weight loss. Owing to promising electrochemical properties and decent thermal stability, Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7, can be an attractive cathode for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sacrificial cathode additive as a pre-metallation method could ensure adequate metal sources for advanced energy storage devices. However, this pre-metallation technique is seriously suffered from the precise regulation of decomposition potential of additive. Herein, a molecularly compensated pre-metallation (Li/Na/K) strategy has been successfully achieved through Kolbe electrolysis, in which the electrochemical oxidation potential of metal carboxylate is manipulated by the bonding energy of oxygen-metal (O-M) moiety. As theoretically predicted, the electron-donating effect of substituent and low charge density of cation can dramatically weaken the O-M bond strength, further bringing out the reduced potential. Thus, sodium acetate exhibits a superior pre-sodiation feature for sodium-ion battery accompanied with a large irreversible specific capacity of 301.8 mAh g -1 , remarkably delivering 70. 6% enhanced capacity retention after 100 cycles. Notably, this elaborate methodology has been profoundly extended to construct high-performance lithium-ion battery and lithium/sodium/potassium-ion capacitor. This breakthrough has paved an innovative pathway for pre-metallation enabled by organic electrochemistry, offering in-depth insights into directional design of sacrificial reagent for electrochemical energy storage systems.",

        "abstract": "Manganese-based Prussian Blue, Na2-δMn[Fe(CN)6] (MnPB), is an auspicious candidate for sodium-ion battery cathode materials due to its high capacity. However, it suffers from severe capacity decay during battery cycling due to the destabilizing Jahn-Teller distortions it undergoes as Mn2+ is oxidized to Mn3+. In this work, the structure is stabilized by a thin epitaxial surface layer of nickel-based Prussian Blue (Na2-δNi[Fe(CN)6]). The one-pot synthesis relies on a chelating agent with an unequal affinity for Mn2+ and Ni2+ ions, which prevents Ni2+ from reacting until the Mn2+ is consumed. This is a new and simpler synthesis of core-shell materials, which traditionally require several steps. The resulting material has an electrochemical capacity of 93 mA h g-1, of which it retains 96% after 500 charge-discharge cycles (vs 37% for MnPB). The material's rate capability is also remarkable: at 4 A g-1 (ca. 55 C) it can reversibly store 70 mA h g-1, which is also reflected in its diffusion coefficient of ~10-8 cm2 s-1. The epitaxial nature of the outer layer appears to exert an anisotropic strain on the inner layer, which may prevent the Jahn-Teller distortions it normally undergoes during de-sodiation.",

Partial substitution of Na with Li leads to enhanced stability and slightly increased specific capacity compared to PNNMO.

In this report, a chemical approach is presented to partially replace Mn2+ of the NVMP framework by Mg2+ and Al3+ substitutions. The Mg- and Al-substituted NVMP cathodes present smoother voltage profiles, facile sodium (de)intercalation, enhanced rate performances (80 mA h g-1 at 5C rate) and capacity retention (≈96% after 100 cycles) in comparison with the unsubstituted sample. Their enhanced performances are attributed to suppressed Jahn-Teller effect, increased covalent character and sodium ion vacancies of the NASICON framework. These results highlight the significance of fine tuning the chemical compositions to attain high performance NASICON cathodes.",

        "abstract": "Although sodium vanadium fluorophosphate, Na3(VO1-xPO4)2F1+2x (0 ≤ x ≤ 1), is a highly promising cathode candidate for sodium-ion batteries due to its stable structure and high working voltage, the low charge diffusion dynamics and the inactive materials used in traditional coating electrodes reduce the energy density of a sodium-ion full battery. Hence, Na3V2O2(PO4)2F/graphene aerogels (NVPF/GAs) with a three-dimensional continuous porous network are firstly prepared by co-assembly and freeze-drying. The three-dimensional porous network helps obtain a high NVPF content of 81 wt.%, relieve the volume change for improving the cyclability, and enhance the wettability of the electrode with the electrolyte for accelerating the diffusion dynamics of sodium ions and electrons. As a directly used freestanding cathode without the use of any binder/collector, an optimized freestanding NVPF/GA electrode exhibits excellent cycling and rate performances than those of traditional coating electrodes. The average capacities at current densities of 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 C are 135.4, 128.0, 125.1, 121.9 and 115.1 mA h g-1, respectively. Especially, it maintains a capacity retention of 100% after 1000 cycles at an ultrahigh current of 40 C. A sodium-ion full battery with the NVPF/GA cathode and the Sb/graphene/carbon anode attains a of 82.1 mA h g-1 without an obvious decline after 100 cycles.",

Here a \"cross-linking\" strategy is proposed to mitigate the typical SIB problems. We present a SIB full battery that exhibits a working potential of 3.3 V and an energy density of 180 Wh kg-1 with good cycle life. The anode is composed of cross-linking hollow carbon sheet encapsulated CuP2 nanoparticles (CHCS-CuP2) and a cathode of carbon coated Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (C-NVPF). For the preparation of the CHCS-CuP2 nanocomposites, we develop an in situ phosphorization approach, which is superior to mechanical mixing. Such CHCS-CuP2 nanocomposites deliver a high reversible capacity of 451 mAh g-1 at 80 mA g-1, showing an excellent capacity retention ratio of 91% in 200 cycles together with good rate capability and stable cycling performance. Post mortem analysis reveals that the cross-linking hollow carbon sheet structure as well as the initially formed SEI layers are well preserved. Moreover, the inner electrochemical resistances do not significantly change. We believe that the presented battery system provides significant progress regarding practical application of SIB.",

X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared measurements were used to characterize the materials and their surface species before and after controlled-atmosphere storage. It was determined that the exposure of untreated NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 powders to moisture results in desodiation and material degradation, leading to poor cycling. This effect was found to be caused by reactive surface species.

The NNMO@CuO cathode material combines the advantages of CuO coating and Cu2+ doping. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, TEM elemental line scan analysis and ex situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that CuO has been successfully coated on the particle surface uniformly, and that this CuO layer effectively suppresses the exfoliation of the metal oxide layers and unfavorable side reactions. Furthermore, Cu2+ is also partially incorporated into the host structure, according to the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and refinement results. Although incorporated Cu2+ does not take part in the redox reactions of the battery cell, the refinement results indicate that the d-spacing of the Na+-ion diffusion layer is enlarged due to Cu2+ doping in the crystal structure, which results in better Na+ kinetics. Thus, the CuO-coated cathode material shows prominent cycling performance and rate capability. We believe that this CuO-coating and Cu2+-doping co-modification strategy provides a promising approach to designing advanced cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

In this work, a monolithic sodium ion battery based on a Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 cathode, MoS2 layered anode, and polyether-based polymer electrolyte is reported. In addition, a new kind of polysulfonamide-supported poly(ethylene glycol) divinyl ether based polymer electrolyte is also demonstrated for monolithic sodium ion battery via in situ preparation. The resultant polymer electrolyte exhibits relatively high ionic conductivity (1.2 mS cm-1 ) at ambient temperature, wide electrochemical window (4.7 V), and favorable mechanical strength (25 MPa). Moreover, such a monolithic Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 /MoS2 sodium ion battery using this polymer electrolyte delivers outstanding rate capability (up to 10 C) and superior cyclic stability (84%) after 1000 cycles at 0.5 C. What is more essential, such a polymer electrolyte based soft-package monolithic sodium ion cell can still power a red light emitting diode lamp and run finite times without suffering from any internal short-circuit failures, even in the case of a bended and wrinkled state.

        "abstract": "Large-scale electric energy storage is fundamental to the use of renewable energy. Recently, research and development efforts on room-temperature sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) have been revitalized, as NIBs are considered promising, low-cost alternatives to the current Li-ion battery technology for large-scale applications. Herein, we introduce a novel layered oxide cathode material, Na0.78Ni0.23Mn0.69O2. This new compound provides a high reversible capacity of 138 mAh g-1 and an average potential of 3.25 V vs Na+/Na with a single smooth voltage profile. Its remarkable rate and cycling performances are attributed to the elimination of the P2-O2 phase transition upon cycling to 4.5 V. The first charge process yields an abnormally excess capacity, which has yet to be observed in other P2 layered oxides. Metal K-edge XANES results show that the major charge compensation at the metal site during Na-ion deintercalation is achieved via the oxidation of nickel (Ni2+) ions, whereas, to a large extent, manganese (Mn) ions remain in their Mn4+ state. Interestingly, electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS) results reveal differences in electronic structures in the bulk and at the surface of electrochemically cycled particles. At the surface, transition metal ions (TM ions) are in a lower valence state than in the bulk, and the O K-edge prepeak disappears. On the basis of previous reports on related Li-excess LIB cathodes, it is proposed that part of the charge compensation mechanism during the first cycle takes place at the lattice oxygen site, resulting in a surface to bulk transition metal gradient. We believe that by optimizing and controlling oxygen activity, Na layered oxide materials with higher capacities can be designed.",

However, there is a lack of fundamental understanding of this dual-ion transport, especially the potentiodynamics of the storage process. Here, a quantitative analysis of Zn2+ and H+ transport in a disordered sodium vanadate (NaV3O8) cathode material has been reported. Collectively, synchrotron X-ray analysis shows that both Zn2+ and H+ storages follow an intercalation storage mechanism in NaV3O8 and proceed in a sequential manner, where intercalations of 0.26 Zn2+ followed by 0.24 H+ per vanadium atom occur during discharging, while reverse dynamics happens during charging. Such a unique and synergistic dual-ion sequential storage favors a high capacity (265 mA h g-1) and an energy density (221 W h kg-1) based on the NaV3O8 cathode and a great cycling life (a capacity retention of 78% after 2000 cycles) in Zn/NaV3O8 full cells.",

        "abstract": "Electrochemical energy storage has recently seen tremendous emphasis being placed on the large-scale (power) grid storage. Sodium-ion batteries are capable of achieving this goal with economic viability. In a recent breakthrough in sodium-ion battery research, the alluaudite framework (Na2Fe2(SO4)3) has been reported, with the highest Fe3+/Fe2+ redox potential (ca. 3.8 V, Barpanda, et al., Nat. Commun., 2014, 5, 4358). Exploring this high-voltage sodium insertion system, we report the discovery of Na2+2xCo2-x(SO4)3 (x = 0.16) as a new member of the alluaudite class of cathode. Stabilized by low-temperature solid-state synthesis (T ≤ 350 °C), this novel Co-based compound assumes a monoclinic structure with C2/c symmetry, which undergoes antiferromagnetic ordering below 10.2 K. Isotypical to the Fe-homologue, it forms a complete family of solid-solution Na2+2x(Fe1-yCoy)2-x(SO4)3 [y = 0-1]. Ab initio DFT analysis hints at potential high voltage operation at 4.76-5.76 V (vs. Na), depending on the degree of desodiation involving a strong participation of the oxygen sub-lattice. With the development of safe organic electrolytes, Na2+2xCo2-x(SO4)3 can work as a cathode material (∼5 V) for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Due to its potential cost advantage, sodium ion batteries could become a commercial alternative to lithium ion batteries. One promising cathode material for this type of battery is layered sodium manganese oxide. In this investigation we report on the influence of morphology on cycle performance for the layered NaxMnO2+z. Hollow spheres of NaxMnO2+z with a diameter of ∼5 μm were compared to flake-like NaxMnO2+z. It was found that the electrochemical behavior of both materials as measured by cyclic voltammetry is comparable. However, the cycle stability of the spheres is significantly higher, with 94 mA h g(-1) discharge capacity after 100 cycles, as opposed to 73 mA h g(-1) for the flakes (50 mA g(-1)). The better stability can potentially be attributed to better accommodation of volume changes of the material due to its spherical morphology, better contact with the added conductive carbon, and higher electrode/electrolyte interface owing to better wetting of the active material with the electrolyte.",

A water-insoluble polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) binder has been widely applied for an aqueous battery, in which the toxic and expensive organic solvent of N-methy-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) is required during the coating process. Herein, we report that the water-soluble SA can be utilized as a binder in aqueous Zn batteries because SA could cross-link with the Zn2+ ion to form a water-insoluble and mechanically super strong binder for electrodes. Aqueous Zn||LiFePO4 cells are assembled to demonstrate the performance of the SA binder for LiFePO4 cathodes. Due to the high adhesion strength of cross-linked Zn-SA, LiFePO4 with the SA binder displays a high capacity retention of 93.7% with a high Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% after 100 cycles at a 0.2 C rate, while the capacity of LiFePO4 with the PVDF binder quickly decays to 84.7% after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. In addition, the LiFePO4 cathode with the SA binder also has smaller redox polarization, faster ion diffusion rate, and more favorable electrochemical kinetics than that with the PVDF binder.",

Through in situ X-ray diffraction measurement and computational analysis, this unique structure is revealed to provide higher Na+ diffusion dynamics and negligible volume change during the sodiation/desodiation processes. As a sodium ion battery cathode, the PBA exhibits a discharge capacity of 90 mA h g-1, which is in good agreement with the complete low spin FeLS(C) redox reaction.

Combining advantages of both, a hybrid‐cation liquid metal battery is designed for a Li‐ion‐insertion‐based cathode to deliver stable high capacity using a Na–K liquid anode to avoid dendrites. The mechanical property of the Na–K alloy is confirmed by simulation and experimental characterization, which leads to stable cycling performance. The charge carrier selection principle in this ternary hybrid‐cation system is investigated, showing consistency with the proposed interfacial layer formation and ion distribution mechanism for the electrochemical process as well as the good stability. With Li ions contributing stable cycling as the cathode charge carrier, the K ion working as charge carrier on the anode, and Na as the medium to liquefy K metal, such a ternary hybrid battery system not only inherits the rich battery chemistry of Li‐insertion cathodes but also broadens the understanding of alkali metal alloys and hybrid‐ion battery chemistry.",

In this work, we develop a dual-network structured hydrogel electrolyte composed of polyacrylamide (PAM), sodium alginate (SA) and potassium iodide (KI) for solid-state zinc-air/iodide hybrid batteries. The assembled hybrid battery shows excellent renewability and a long cycling life of 110 h with a high energy efficiency of 80%. The ion-crosslinked dual-network structure endows the material with improved mechanical strength and increased ionic conductivity. More importantly, the introduction of iodine species not only offers more favorable cathodic kinetics of iodide/iodate redox than oxygen electrocatalysis but also regulates the solvation structure of zinc ions to ensure better interface stability. This work provides significant concepts for developing novel solid-state electrolytes to realize high-performance energy devices and technologies.",

In this work, we successfully demonstrated the first transient rechargeable batteries based on dissoluble electrodes including V2O5 as the cathode and lithium metal as the anode as well as a biodegradable separator and battery encasement (PVP and sodium alginate, respectively). All the components are robust in a traditional lithium-ion battery (LIB) organic electrolyte and disappear in water completely within minutes due to triggered cascade reactions. With a simple cut-and-stack method, we designed a fully transient device with an area of 0.5 cm by 1 cm and total energy of 0.1 J. A shadow-mask technique was used to demonstrate the miniature device, which is compatible with transient electronics manufacturing. The materials, fabrication methods, and integration strategy discussed will be of interest for future developments in transient, self-powered electronics. The demonstration of a miniature Li battery shows the feasibility toward system integration for all transient electronics.",

The calculated equilibrium morphology is mostly isometric in appearance, with (010), (201) and (011) faces dominant. Exposure of the (010) surface is vital because it is normal to the one-dimensional ion-conduction pathway. Platelet and cube-like shapes observed by previous microscopy studies are reproduced by adjusting surface energies.

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries have recently emerged as a promising alternative to lithium‐based batteries, driven by an ever‐growing demand for electricity storage systems. The present workproposes a cobalt‐free high‐capacity cathode for sodium‐ion batteries, synthesized using a high‐entropy approach. The high‐entropy approach entails mixing more than five elements in a single phase; hence, obtaining the desired properties is a challenge since this involves the interplay between different elements. Here, instead of oxide, oxyfluoride is chosen to suppress oxygen loss during long‐term cycling. Supplement to this, lithium is introduced in the composition to obtain high configurational entropy and sodium vacant sites, thus stabilizing the crystal structure, accelerating the kinetics of intercalation/deintercalation, and improving the air stability of the material. With the optimization of the cathode composition, a reversible capacity of 109 mAh g−1 (2–4 V) and 144 mAh g−1 (2–4.3 V) is observed in the first few cycles, along with a significant improvement in stability during prolonged cycling. Furthermore, in situ and ex situ diffraction studies during charging/discharging reveal that the high‐entropy strategy successfully suppresses the complex phase transition. The impressive outcomes of the present work strongly motivate the pursuit of the high‐entropy approach to develop efficient cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries.",

Herein, Na5V12O32 nanobelts (NVO‐NBs)‐based heterostructure is fabricated with boosting the sodium‐ion kinetic characteristics to address the challenges. In the heterostructure, the controllable VOC bonds are generated at the interface originating from the chemical conversion of functional groups of the reduced graphene oxides (rGOs) with VO bonding of NVO through interfacial electronic interactions. The interfacial synergistic between the brilliant bonding properties and the inherent formation of a stress field at the heterointerface motivated by work function difference can reduce the Na+ diffusion barrier, facilitate charge transfer, hence accelerates reaction kinetics and electron/ion transport, as well as modifying the electronic structure to realize a cherished adsorption energy of Na+. Therefore, the optimized NVO‐NBs‐based heterostructure exhibits exceptional rate capability (213 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C with 100 mAh g−1 at 10 C) and ultralong cycling stability (95.4%, 3000 cycles at 5 C).

Herein, a high‐entropy substitution strategy, to alter the detailed crystal structure of NVPF without changing the central active V atom, is pioneeringly utilized, achieving simultaneous electronic conductivity enhancement and diffusion barrier reduction for Na+, according to theoretical calculations. The as‐prepared carbon‐free high‐entropy Na3V1.9(Ca,Mg,Al,Cr,Mn)0.1(PO4)2F3 (HE‐NVPF) cathode can deliver higher mean voltage of 3.81 V and more advantageous energy density up to 445.5 Wh kg−1, which is attributed by the diverse transition‐metal elemental substitution in high‐entropy crystalline. More importantly, high‐entropy introduction can help realize disordered rearrangement of Na+ at Na(2) active sites, thereby to refrain from unfavorable discharging behaviors at low‐voltage region, further lifting up the mean working voltage to realize a full Na‐ion storage at the high voltage plateau. Coupling with a hard carbon (HC) anode, HE‐NVPF//HC SIB full cells can deliver high specific energy density of 326.8 Wh kg−1 at 5 C with the power density of 2178.9 W kg−1.

However, their rate capability and durability are limited by tortuous Na+ diffusion channels and complicated phase evolution during Na+ extraction/insertion. Here we report our findings in unravelling the mechanism for dramatically enhancing the stability and rate capability of O3-NaNi0.5Mn0.5-xSbxO2 (NaNMS) by substitutional Sb doping, which can alter the coordination environment and chemical bonds of the transition metal (TM) ions in the structure, resulting in a more stable structure with wider Na+ transport channels. Furthermore, NaNMS nanoparticles are obtained by surface energy regulation during grain growth. The synergistic effect of Sb doping and nanostructuring greatly reduces the ionic migration energy barrier while increasing the reversibility of the structural evolution during repeated Na+ extraction/insertion. An optimized NaNMS-1 electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 212.3 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C and 74.5 mAh g-1 at 50 C with minimal capacity loss after 100 cycles at a low temperature of -20 °C.

In this way, the interlayer OO electrostatic repulsion is weakened upon deeply charging, which strongly affects the systematic total energy that transforms the striking P2–O2 interlayer contraction into a moderate solid‐solution‐type evolution. Accordingly, the cycling stability of the codoped cathode material is improved superiorly over the pristine sample.

To date, no Na-ion counterpart exists wherein Na-ion cathodes can be synthesized in such a way to be comparable to that obtained in bulk synthesis. Herein, we develop a synthesis route wherein hundreds of mg-scale powder samples can be made in a total time of 3 days. We focus on materials in the Na-Fe-Mn-O pseudo-ternary system of high immediate interest. Using a sol-gel method, developed herein, yields both phase-pure combinatorial samples of Na2/3Fe1/2Mn1/2O2 and NaFe1/2Mn1/2O2, consistent with previous reports on bulk samples of interest commercially. By contrast, the synthesis route used for Li-ion cathodes (namely co-precipitations) does not yield phase pure materials, suggesting that the sol-gel method is more effective in mixing the Na, Fe and Mn than co-precipitation. This has important consequences for all attempts to make these materials, even in bulk. Finally, we demonstrate that these mg-scale powder samples can be tested electrochemically in a combinatorial cell. The resulting cyclic voltammograms are in excellent agreement with those found on bulk samples in the literature. This demonstrates that the methodology developed here will be effective in characterizing the hundreds of samples needed to understand the complex ternary systems of interest, and that such results will scale-up well to the g and kg-scale.",

Layered iron/manganese oxide cathodes receive extensive attentions due to the element abundance and large theoretical capacity. However, these materials usually undergo obvious degradation of electrochemical performance due to the tendency of Mn dissolution and Fe migration during continuous sodium release and uptake. Herein, a strategy of anion–cation synergetic redox is proposed to suppress the structural deterioration originated from overusing the electrochemical activity of transition‐metal ions, and decreased lattice strain as well as superior electrochemical performance are realized simultaneously. Results show that the Na0.8Li0.2Fe0.2Mn0.6O2 (NLFM) electrode is highly resistant to the erosion of moisture that is distinct from the traditional Mn/Fe‐based electrodes. Moreover, the NLFM electrode demonstrates solid solution behavior without phase transition during cycles. The ultra‐small volume change of 0.85% is ascribed to the negligible manganese dissolution and invisible transition‐metal migration. The high‐stable layered structure assures superior reversible capacity of ≈165 mA h g–1, excellent rate capability, and splendid capacity retention of over 98.3% with 100 cycles. The findings deepen the understanding of the synergy between anion and cation redox and provide new insights to design the high‐stable layered cathode for sodium‐ion batteries.",

Herein, we for the first time propose the \"pinning effect\" and controllable \"pinning point\" in sodium storage layered cathodes to enhance the structural stability and achieve the optimal electrochemical performance. 0%, 2.5% and 7.3% transition-metal (TM) occupancies in Na-site as pinning points are obtained through adjusting the feeding ratio of iron in Na 0.67 Mn 0.5 Co 0.5- x Fe x O 2 system. Results show that 2.5% TM pinning is beneficial to restrain the potential slab sliding and enhance the structural stability, resulting in an ultra-low volume variation of 0.6% and maintaining the smooth two-dimensional channel for Na-ion transfer. Finally, the Na 0.67 Mn 0.5 Co 0.4 Fe 0.1 O 2 cathode with the optimal TM pinning delivers outstanding cycling performance of over 1000 cycles and superior rate capability up to 10C.",

        "abstract": "Oxygen‐redox of layer‐structured metal‐oxide cathodes has drawn great attention as an effective approach to break through the bottleneck of their capacity limit. However, reversible oxygen‐redox can only be obtained in the high‐voltage region (usually over 3.5 V) in current metal‐oxide cathodes. Here, we realize reversible oxygen‐redox in a wide voltage range of 1.5–4.5 V in a P2‐layered Na0.7Mg0.2[Fe0.2Mn0.6□0.2]O2 cathode material, where intrinsic vacancies are located in transition‐metal (TM) sites and Mg‐ions are located in Na sites. Mg‐ions in the Na layer serve as “pillars” to stabilize the layered structure during electrochemical cycling, especially in the high‐voltage region. Intrinsic vacancies in the TM layer create the local configurations of “□–O–□”, “Na–O–□” and “Mg–O–□” to trigger oxygen‐redox in the whole voltage range of charge–discharge. Time‐resolved techniques demonstrate that the P2 phase is well maintained in a wide potential window range of 1.5–4.5 V even at 10 C. It is revealed that charge compensation from Mn‐ and O‐ions contributes to the whole voltage range of 1.5–4.5 V, while the redox of Fe‐ions only contributes to the high‐voltage region of 3.0–4.5 V. The orphaned electrons in the nonbonding 2p orbitals of O that point toward TM‐vacancy sites are responsible for reversible oxygen‐redox, and Mg‐ions in Na sites suppress oxygen release effectively.",

Rapid precipitation may lead to a large number of vacancies and a large amount of interstitial water in the material, resulting in poor electrochemical performance in batteries. Hence, sodium citrate is used to compete with [Fe(CN)6]4- to slow down the coordination rates of Ni2+ and Mn2+ ions with ferrous cyanide ions. The feasibility of the experiment is also confirmed by theoretical analysis. Benefiting from stable crystal structure and the removal of interstitial water, the as-prepared Na2NixMnyFe(CN)6 sample exhibits a high reversible capacity of 150 mA h g-1. In addition, a high rate performance of 77 mA h g-1 is achieved at a current density of 1600 mA g-1. Most noteworthy, the Coulombic efficiency and specific capacity gradually increase in the first few cycles, which can be ascribed to the formation of a passivation layer on the surface of the electrode. Continuous testing in an electrolyte solution of 1 M NaPF6 dissolved in sulfone reveals that the presence of a passivation film is very important for the stability of the electrode.",

NASICON (Na super-ionic conductor)-structured Nax MnM(PO4 )3 materials (M represents transition metal) have drawn increasing attention due to their features of robust crystal framework, low cost, as well as high voltage based on Mn4+ /Mn3+ and Mn3+ /Mn2+ redox couples. However, full activation of Mn4+ /Mn3+ redox couple within NASICON framework is still a great challenge. Herein, a novel NASICON-type Na4 MnCr(PO4 )3 material with highly reversible Mn4+ /Mn3+ redox reaction is discovered. It proceeds a two-step reaction with voltage platforms centered at 4.15 and 3.52 V versus Na+ /Na, delivering a capacity of 108.4 mA h g-1 . The Na4 MnCr(PO4 )3 cathode also exhibits long durability over 500 cycles and impressive rate capability up to 10 C. The galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) test shows fast Na diffusivity which is further verified by density functional theory calculations. The high electrochemical activity derives from the 3D robust framework structure, fast kinetics, and pseudocapacitive contribution. The sodium storage mechanism of the Na4 MnCr(PO4 )3 cathode is deeply studied by ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), revealing that both solid-solution and two-phase reactions are involved in the Na+ ions extraction/insertion process.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries have gained much attention for their potential application in large‐scale stationary energy storage due to the low cost and abundant sodium sources in the earth. However, the electrochemical performance of sodium‐ion full cells (SIFCs) suffers severely from the irreversible consumption of sodium ions of cathode during the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation of hard carbon anode. Here, a high‐efficiency cathode sodiation compensation reagent, sodium oxalate (Na2C2O4), which possesses both a high theoretical capacity of 400 mA h g−1 and a capacity utilization as high as 99%, is proposed. The implementation of Na2C2O4 as sacrificial sodium species is successfully realized by decreasing its oxidation potential from 4.41 to 3.97 V through tuning conductive additives with different physicochemical features, and the corresponding mechanism of oxidation potential manipulation is analyzed. Electrochemical results show that in the full cell based on a hard carbon anode and a P2‐Na2/3Ni1/3Mn1/3Ti1/3O2 cathode with Na2C2O4 as a sodium reservoir to compensate for sodium loss during SEI formation, the capacity retention is increased from 63% to 85% after 200 cycles and the energy density is improved from 129.2 to 172.6 W h kg−1.

Multiscale electron microscopy and affiliated spectroscopy analyses reveal that in addition to the microscale O3/O'3-P2 core-shell structure, nanoscale coherent P2/O3 intergrown structure can also be identified in the composite. Such well-tailored structures not only constrain the structural damages (microscale cracks) induced by repeated volumetric changes upon desodiation and re-sodiation, but also facilitate fast Na ions diffusion through the exterior P2-type layered structure.

We synthesize the materials via coprecipitation followed by annealing in air and rinsing with water, and we examine the electrodes as cathodes for sodium-ion batteries using a propylene carbonate-based electrolyte. We fully investigate the effect of the Ni-to-Fe ratio, annealing temperature, and sodium content on the electrochemical performances of the electrodes. The impact of these parameters on the structural and electrochemical properties of the materials is revealed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and cyclic voltammetry, respectively. The suitability of this class of P-type materials for sodium battery application is finally demonstrated by cycling tests revealing an excellent electrochemical performance in terms of delivered capacity (i.e., about 200 mAh g(-1)) and charge-discharge efficiency (approaching 100%).",

Transition metal oxide cathodes represent one of the most dynamic materials for industrialization among the various cathodes for SIBs.

        "abstract": "An engaging area of research in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) has been focusing on discovery, design and synthesis of high-capacity cathode materials in order to boost energy density to levels close enough to the state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries. Of particular interest, P2-type layered oxide, Na2/3Fe1/2Mn1/2O2, has been researched as a potential cathode in SIBs based on its high theoretical capacity of 260 mAh/g and use of non-critical materials. However, the reported synthesis methods are not only complex and energy-demanding, but also often yield inhomogeneous and impure materials with capacities less than 200 mAh/g under impractical test conditions. Here, we report a novel synthesis route using low temperature eutectic reaction to produce highly homogeneous and crystalline, and impurity-free P2-NaxFe1/2Mn1/2O2 with enhanced Na-ion diffusivity and kinetics. The overall electrochemical performances of the Na-ion cells have been improved by pairing the P2-cathode with pre-sodiated hard carbon anodes, leading to reversible capacities in the range of 180 mAh/g. This new approach is a contribution towards the simplification of synthesis and scalability of sodium-based cathodes with high crystallinity and fine-tuned morphology, and the realization of a sodium-ion battery system with lower cost and improved electrochemical performance.",

        "abstract": "The vital challenge of layered manganese oxide cathode for sodium-ion batteries is its severe capacity degradation and sluggish ion diffusion kinetics caused by irreversible phase transitions. In response to this problem, the spinel-layered manganese-based composite with intergrowth structure is ingeniously designed by virtue of an interesting spinel-to-layered transformation in the delithiated LiMn2O4 under Na+ insertion. This unique spinel-layered intergrowth structure is strongly confirmed by combining multiple structure analysis techniques.

As an appealing cathode for sodium-ion batteries, the layered-spinel composite delivers a high reversible capacity of 180.9 mAh g-1, excellent cycling stability, and superior rate capability with 55.7 mAh g-1 at 12 C. Furthermore, the reaction mechanism upon Na+ extraction/insertion is revealed in detail by ex-situ X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, indicating that Na+ ions can be accommodated by the layered structure at a low voltage and by spinel at a high voltage.

We synthesize an N-doped graphene oxide wrapped Na 3 V(PO 3 ) 3 N composite with a uniform carbon coating layer, and it shows both excellent rate performance and outstanding cycling stability. Its air/water stability and all-climate performance are carefully investigated in detail. Near-zero volume change (~0.40%) is clearly observed for the first time based on in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, and the in-situ X-ray absorption spectra reveal the V 3.2+ /V 4.2+ redox reaction with high reversibility. Its three-dimensional sodium diffusion pathways are explicitly demonstrated with distinctive low energy barriers. Higher reversible capacity and a higher working platform can surely be achieved if the electrolyte possesses a wider voltage tolerance window above 4.8 V.

Herein, we devise a scaled-up electrospinning avenue to fabricate nanocrystal-constructed ultralong layered NaCrO2 nanowires (NWs) toward SIBs as a wide-temperature-operating cathode. The resultant one-dimensional (1D) NaCrO2 nanoarchitecture is endowed with orientated and shortened electronic/ionic transport and remarkable structural tolerance to stress change over sodiation-desodiation processes. Benefiting from these structural superiorities, the NaCrO2 NWs are featured with prominent Na+-storage behaviors in the wide-operating-temperature range from -15 to 55 °C. Promisingly, the NaCrO2 NWs exhibit extraordinary high-rate capacities of ∼108.8 and ∼87.2 mAh g-1 at 10 and 50 C rates at 25 °C, and even 94.6 (55 °C) and ∼60.1 (-15 °C) mAh g-1 at 10 C, along with outstanding cyclic stabilities with capacity retentions of ∼80.6% (-15 °C), 88.4% (25 °C), and ∼86.9% (55 °C). The overall performance of our NaCrO2 is superior to other reported NaCrO2-based cathodes, even with conductive nanocarbon coating. Encouragingly, a competitive energy density of ∼161 Wh kg-1 can be obtained by the NaCrO2 NWs-based full cell. Therefore, our NaCrO2 NWs can be highly anticipated as advanced cathode for commercial wide-temperature-tolerance SIBs.",

Herein, we developed Ru-substituted P2-Na0.6MnO2 as a promising sodium host with a high reversible capacity and cycle life. The multiple characterization investigations reveal that Ru substitution could improve the electronic and ionic conductions and particularly suppress the phase transition of P2-OP4, resulting in the extension of the single-phase reaction region. Ru substitution not only enhances the specific capacity (209.3 mA h g-1) but also improves the rate capability (∼100 mA h g-1 at 50 C) and cycling stability.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have huge potential in large-scale energy storage applications. Layered Fe-based oxides are one of the desirable cathode materials due to abundance in the earth crust and high activity in electrochemical processes. However, Fe-ion migration to Na layers is one of the major hurdles leading to irreversible structural degradation. Herein, it is revealed that distinct Fe-ion migration in cycling NaFeO2 (NFO) should be mainly responsible for the strong local lattice strain and resulting particle cracks, all of which results in the deterioration of electrochemical performance. More importantly, a strategy of Ru doping could effectively suppress the Fe-ion migration and then reduce the local lattice strain and the particle cracks, finally to greatly enhance the sodium storage performance. Atomic-scale characterization shows that NFO electrode after cycling presents the intense lattice strain locally, accompanied by the remarkable particle cracks. Whereas, Ru-doped NFO electrode maintains the well-ordered layered structure by inhibiting the Fe-O distortion, so as to eliminate the resulting side effect. As a result, Ru-doped NFO could greatly improve the comprehensive electrochemical performance by delivering a reversible capacity of 120 mA h g-1 , about 80% capacity retention after 100 cycles. The findings provide new insights for designing high-performance electrodes for sodium-ion batteries.",

NaNi0.45Mn0.25Ti0.3O2 with co-substitution possesses an expanded interlayer and exhibits higher rate capability, as well as cyclic stability, compared with the pristine cathode in 2.0-4.4 V.

        "abstract": "Recently, the substitution of inactive elements has been reported as a promising strategy for improving the structural stability and electrochemical performance of layered cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). In this regard, we have investigated the positive effects of inactive Ti substitution into O3-type NaFe0.25Ni0.25Mn0.5O2, based on first principles calculations and electrochemical experiments. After Ti substitution, Na[Ti0.03(Fe0.25Ni0.25Mn0.5)0.97]O2 exhibits improved capacity retention and rate capability compared with Ti-free NaFe0.25Ni0.25Mn0.5O2. Such improvement is primarily attributed to the enhanced structural stability and lowered activation energy for Na+ migration, induced by Ti substitution in the host structure. Based on the first principles calculations of the average net charges and partial densities of states, we suggest that Ti substitution effectively enhances the binding between transition metals and oxygen by increasing the oxygen electron density, which in turn lowers the energy barrier of Na+ migration, leading to a notable enhancement in the rate capability of Na[Ti0.03(Fe0.25Ni0.25Mn0.5)0.97]O2. Compared with other inactive elements (e.g. Al and Mg), Ti is a more suitable substituent for improving the electrochemical properties of layered cathode materials because of its large total charge variation contributing to capacity. The results of this study should provide a practical guideline for developing highly reliable layered cathode materials for SIBs.",

This P2-NaLiMMCO cathode material with uniform microsize secondary spheres and nanosize primary crystalline particles delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 166 mA h g–1 and superior capacity retention, which are superior to most previously reported results. The improved stability of the cathode material was further investigated by the in situ X-ray diffraction technique, which suggests an enhanced reversibility of the cathode material during the desodiation/sodiation process.

Here, a mesoporous Na2 FePO4 F@C (M-NFPF@C) composite derived from mesoporous FePO4 is synthesized through a facile ball-milling combined calcination method.

The combination of theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations reveals that LiTM creates Na-O-Li electronic configurations to boost the capacity derived from the oxygen anionic redox, while LiAM serves as LiO6 prismatic pillars to stabilize the layered structure through suppressing the detrimental phase transitions. As a result, NMLMO delivers a high specific capacity of 266 mAh g-1 and simultaneously exhibits the nearly zero-strain characteristic within a wide voltage range of 1.5-4.6 V.

        "abstract": "All‐solid‐state sodium ion batteries (AS3iBs) are highly sought after for stationary energy storage systems due to their suitable safety and stability over a wide temperature range. Hard carbon (HC), which is low cost, exhibits a low redox potential, and a high capacity, is integral to achieve a practical large‐scale sodium‐ion battery. However, the energy density of the battery utilizing this anode material is hampered by its low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). Herein, two strategies, namely i) additional pyrolysis and ii) presodiation by thermal decomposition of NaBH4, are explored to improve the ICE of pristine HC. Raman spectroscopy, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrochemical characterizations elucidate that the thermal treatment increases the Csp2 content in the HC structure, while the presodiation supplies the sodium to occupy the intrinsic irreversible sites. Consequently, presodiated HC exhibits an outstanding ICE (>99%) compared to the thermally treated (90%) or pristine HC (83%) in half‐cell configurations. More importantly, AS3iB using presodiated HC and NaCrO2 as the anode and cathode, respectively, exhibits a high ICE of 92% and an initial discharge energy density of 294Whkgcathode−1$294\\ {\\rm Wh}\\ {\\rm{kg}}_{{\\rm{cathode}}}^{ - 1}$ .",

Because the hollow structure can relieve volume expansion and core-shell heterostructure can optimize interfacial properties, the complex structure materials exhibited a highly initial capacity of 123 mA h g-1 and a long cycle life. After 600 cycles, the reversible capacity of the electrode still maintains at 102 mA h g-1 without significant voltage decay, indicating a superior structure stability and sodium storage kinetics. Even at high current density of 3200 mA g-1 , the electrode still delivers a considerable capacity above 52 mA h g-1 .

Here, a Na[Li0.05Ni0.3Mn0.5Cu0.1Mg0.05]O2 cathode material with the exposed {010} active facets by multiple‐layer oriented stacking nanosheets is presented.

Based on the combined analyses of cyclic voltammograms, ex situ X‐ray absorption spectroscopy, and operando X‐ray diffraction, the reaction mechanisms behind the superior electrochemical performance are clearly articulated. Surprisingly, Ni2+/Ni3+ and Cu2+/Cu3+ redox couples are simultaneously involved in the charge compensation with a highly reversible O3–P3 phase transition during charge/discharge process and the Na+ storage is governed by a capacitive mechanism via quantitative kinetics analysis.

To enlarge the alkali-layer distance inside the layer structure of NaNFM may benefit Na+ diffusion. Herein, the effect of Ca-substitution is reported in Na sites on the structural and electrochemical properties of Na1-x Cax/2 NFM (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared Na1-x Cax/2 NFM samples show single α-NaFeO2 type phase with slightly increased alkali-layer distance as Ca content increases. The cycling stabilities of Ca-substituted samples are remarkably improved.

        "abstract": "As a widely used approach to modify a material's bulk properties, doping can effectively improve electrochemical properties and structural stability of various cathodes for rechargeable batteries, which usually empirically favors a uniform distribution of dopants. It is reported that dopant aggregation effectively boosts the cyclability of a Mg‐doped P2‐type layered cathode (Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2). Experimental characterization and calculation consistently reveal that randomly distributed Mg dopants tend to segregate into the Na‐layer during high‐voltage cycling, leading to the formation of high‐density precipitates. Intriguingly, such Mg‐enriched precipitates, acting as 3D network pillars, can further enhance a material's mechanical strength, suppress cracking, and consequently benefit cyclability. This work not only deepens the understanding on dopant evolution but also offers a conceptually new approach by utilizing precipitation strengthening design to counter cracking related degradation and improve high‐voltage cyclability of layered cathodes.",

Here, we challenge to minimize the effect of the Jahn-Teller distortion caused by Mn3+ in the structure, via substitution of Mn3+ by Co3+ in P2-Na2/3[Mn1-xCox]O2 (x = 0 - 0.3). P2-Na2/3[Mn0.8Co0.2]O2 compound substantializes electrochemical performance with a capacity of about 175 mAh g-1 (26 mA g-1), and retained over 90 % of its initial capacity for 300 cycles at 0.1C (26 mA g-1) and 10C (2.6 A g-1). Operando X-ray diffraction study indicates that a single-phase reaction is associated with the insertion of sodium ions into the structure, accompanied by a small volume change approximately 3%. Furthermore, ex situ X-ray diffraction, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy results show that crystal structure remained after continuous 300 cycles.

A group of P2-type cathodes containing various amounts of Ti is prepared using a facile synthetic method. These cathodes show different behaviors of the Na+/vacancy ordering. Na0.67CoO2 suffers severe capacity loss at high voltages due to irreversible structure changes causing serious polarization, while the Ti-substituted cathodes have long credible cycleability as well as high energy. In particular, Na0.67Co0.90Ti0.10O2 exhibits excellent capacity retention (115 mAh g-1) even after 100 cycles, whereas Na0.67CoO2 exhibits negligible capacity retention (<10 mAh g-1) at 4.5 V cutoff conditions. Na0.67Co0.90Ti0.10O2 also exhibits outstanding rate capabilities of 108 mAh g-1 at a current density of 1000 mA g-1 (7.4 C).

        "abstract": "In this study, we developed a doping technology capable of improving the electrochemical performance, including the rate capability and cycling stability, of P2-type Na0.67Fe0.5Mn0.5O2 as a cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. Our approach involved using titanium as a doping element to partly substitute either Fe or Mn in Na0.67Fe0.5Mn0.5O2. The Ti-substituted Na0.67Fe0.5Mn0.5O2 shows superior electrochemical properties compared to the pristine sample. We investigated the changes in the crystal structure, surface chemistry, and particle morphology caused by Ti doping and correlated these changes to the improved performance. The enhanced rate capability and cycling stability were attributed to the enlargement of the NaO2 slab in the crystal structure because of Ti doping. This promoted Na-ion diffusion and prevented the phase transition from the P2 to the OP4/″Z″ structure.",

Herein, we report high crystalline and Na-rich Prussian white Na2 CoFe(CN)6 nanocubes synthesized by an optimized and facile co-precipitation method. The influence of crystallinity and sodium content on the electrochemical properties was systematically investigated. The optimized Na2 CoFe(CN)6 nanocubes exhibited an initial capacity of 151 mA h g-1 , which is close to its theoretical capacity (170 mA h g-1 ). Meanwhile, the Na2 CoFe(CN)6 cathode demonstrated an outstanding long-term cycle performance, retaining 78 % of its initial capacity after 500 cycles. Furthermore, the Na2 CoFe(CN)6 Prussian white nanocubes also achieved a superior rate capability (115 mA h g-1 at 400 mA g-1 , 92 mA h g-1 at 800 mA g-1 ). The enhanced performances could be attributed to the robust crystal structure and rapid transport of Na ions through large channels in the open-framework. Most noteworthy, the as-prepared Na2 CoFe(CN)6 nanocubes are not only low-cost in raw materials but also contain a rich sodium content (1.87 Na ions per lattice unit cell), which will be favorable for full cell fabrication and large-scale electric storage applications.",

        "abstract": "Layered sodium transition-metal oxides, NaxMeO2, with large theoretical capacity are regarded as an important class of cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, they usually exhibit inferior thermodynamic stability and sluggish Na+ kinetics due to the unwanted phase transitions and large Na+-ionic radius. In this work, considering the beneficial synergistic effects of layered P2/P3 and Fd3[combining macron]m spinel phases, a stable layered/spinel intergrowth nanocomposite Na0.5[Ni0.2Co0.15Mn0.65]O2 is rationally designed and successfully prepared via a co-precipitation route and a subsequent solid-state reaction, and the triphase synergy in this layered/spinel nanocomposite is demonstrated. In Na/Na0.5[Ni0.2Co0.15Mn0.65]O2 half-cells, it delivers a high specific capacity of ∼180 mA h g-1 and a good cycling stability, with a capacity retention of 87.6% after 100 cycles, at a rate of 0.1C between 1.5 and 4.0 V (vs. Na/Na+). The large reversible capacity of 105 mA h g-1 is also achieved even at a high rate of 10C, indicating high-rate capability. Besides, the full-cells using this nanocomposite as the cathode and hard carbon as the anode exhibit long-term cycle-life and high-power properties, indicating the expected merits of layered/spinel mixed phases. The superior sodium storage performance of this layered P3/P2 and spinel intergrowth nanocomposite makes it a promising candidate as a long-life and high-rate cathode for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) receive significant attention for electrochemical energy storage and conversion owing to their wide availability and the low cost of Na resources. However, SIBs face challenges of low specific energy, short cycling life, and insufficient specific power, owing to the heavy mass and large radius of Na+ ions. As an important component of SIBs, cathode materials have a significant effect on the SIB electrochemical performance. The most recent advances and prospects of inorganic and organic cathode materials are summarized here. Among current cathode materials, layered transition‐metal oxides achieve high specific energies around 600 mW h g−1 owing to their high specific capacities of 180–220 mA h g−1 and their moderate operating potentials of 2.7–3.2 V (vs Na+/Na). Porous Na3V2(PO4)3/C nanomaterials exhibit excellent cycling performance with almost 100% retention over 1000 cycles owing to their robust structural framework. Recent emerging cathode materials, such as amorphous NaFePO4 and pteridine derivatives show interesting electrochemical properties and attractive prospects for application in SIBs. Future work should focus on strategies to enhance the overall performance of cathode materials in terms of specific energy, cycling life, and rate capability with cationic doping, anionic substitution, morphology fabrication, and electrolyte matching.",

        "abstract": "Rechargeable sodium‐ion batteries are proposed as the most appropriate alternative to lithium batteries due to the fast consumption of the limited lithium resources. Due to their improved safety, polyanion framework compounds have recently gained attention as potential candidates. With the earth‐abundant element Fe being the redox center, the uniform carbon‐coated Na3.32Fe2.34(P2O7)2/C composite represents a promising alternative for sodium‐ion batteries. The electrochemical results show that the as‐prepared Na3.32Fe2.34(P2O7)2/C composite can deliver capacity of ≈100 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C (1 C = 120 mA g−1), with capacity retention of 92.3% at 0.5 C after 300 cycles. After adding fluoroethylene carbonate additive to the electrolyte, 89.6% of the initial capacity is maintained, even after 1100 cycles at 5 C. The electrochemical mechanism is systematically investigated via both in situ synchrotron X‐ray diffraction and density functional theory calculations. The results show that the sodiation and desodiation are single‐phase‐transition processes with two 1D sodium paths, which facilitates fast ionic diffusion. A small volume change, nearly 100% first‐cycle Coulombic efficiency, and a pseudocapacitance contribution are also demonstrated. This research indicates that this new compound could be a potential competitor for other iron‐based cathode electrodes for application in large‐scale Na rechargeable batteries.",

It is also found that a light change on the local electronic and structural states or phase change could be observed after the first cycle, resulting in the fast capacity fade at room temperature.

In this paper, we design a new type of free-standing carbon quantum dot coated VO2 interwoven nanowires through a simple fabrication process and demonstrate its potential to be used as cathode material for lithium and sodium ion batteries. The versatile carbon quantum dots that are vastly flexible for surface engineering serve the function of protecting the nanowire surface and play an important role in the diffusion of electrons. Also, the three-dimensional carbon cloth coated with VO2 interwoven nanowires assisted in the diffusion of ions through the inner and the outer surface.

Herein, one new P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn5/9Al1/9O2 (NMA) cathode material is successfully prepared via a simple and facile liquid-state method. The prepared NMA is layered transition metal oxide, which can keep stable crystal structure during sodiation/desodiation as demonstrated by the ex situ X-ray diffraction, and its electrochemical properties can be further enhanced by connecting the cake-like NMA microparticles with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) using a ball milling method. Electrochemical tests show that the formed RGO-connected NMA (NMA/RGO) can deliver a higher reversible capacity of up to 138 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and also exhibit a superior high-rate capabilities and cycling stability in comparison to pure NMA. The much improved properties should be attributed to the reduced particle size and improvement of electrical conductivity and apparent Na(+) diffusion due to RGO incorporation, which is comprehensively verified by the electrochemical technologies of galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry at various scan rate as well as ex-situ X-ray diffraction studies.",

        "abstract": "Co substitution has been extensively used to improve the electrochemical performances of cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), but the role of Co has not been well understood. Herein, we have comprehensively investigated the effects of Co substitution for Ni on the structure and electrochemical performances of Na0.7Mn0.7Ni0.3-xCoxO2 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3) as cathode materials for SIBs. In comparison with the Co-free sample, the high-rate capability and cycle performance have been greatly improved by the substitution of Co, and some new insights into the role of Co have been proposed for the first time. With the substitution of Co(3+) for Ni(2+) the lattice parameter a decreases; however, c increases, and the d-spacing of the sodium-ion diffusion layer has been enlarged, which enhances the diffusion coefficient of the sodium ion and the high-rate capability of cathode materials. In addition, Co substitution shortens the bond lengths of TM-O (TM = transition metal) and O-O due to the smaller size of Co(3+) than Ni(2+), which accounts for the decreased thickness and volume of the TMO6 octahedron. The contraction of TM-O and O-O bond lengths and the shrinkage of the TMO6 octahedron improve the structure stability and the cycle performance. Last but not least, the aliovalent substitution of Co(3+) for Ni(2+) can improve the electronic conductivity during the electrochemical reaction, which is also favorable to enhance the high-rate performance. This study not only unveils the role of Co in improving the high-rate capability and the cycle stability of layered Na0.7Mn0.7Ni0.3-xCoxO2 cathode materials but also offers some new insights into designing high performance cathode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Although sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the electrochemical performances, in particular the energy density, are much lower than LIBs. A metal-organic compound, cuprous 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (CuTCNQ), is presented as a new kind of cathode material for SIBs. It consists of both cationic (CuII ↔CuI ) and anionic (TCNQ0 ↔TCNQ- ↔ TCNQ2- ) reversible redox reactions, delivering a discharge capacity as high as 255 mAh g-1 at a current density of 20 mA g-1 . The synergistic effect of both redox-active metal cations and organic anions brings an electrochemical transfer of multiple electrons. The transformation of cupric ions to cuprous ions occurs at near 3.80 V vs. Na+ /Na, while the full reduction of TCNQ0 to TCNQ- happens at 3.00-3.30 V. The remarkably high voltage is attributed to the strong inductive effect of the four cyano groups.",

        "abstract": "Developing sodium‐ion batteries for large‐scale energy storage applications is facing big challenges of the lack of high‐performance cathode materials. Here, a series of new cathode materials Na0.66CoxMn0.66–xTi0.34O2 for sodium‐ion batteries are designed and synthesized aiming to reduce transition metal‐ion ordering, charge ordering, as well as Na+ and vacancy ordering. An interesting structure change of Na0.66CoxMn0.66–xTi0.34O2 from orthorhombic to hexagonal is revealed when Co content increases from x = 0 to 0.33. In particular, Na0.66Co0.22Mn0.44Ti0.34O2 with a P2‐type layered structure delivers a reversible capacity of 120 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C. When the current density increases to 10 C, a reversible capacity of 63.2 mAh g−1 can still be obtained, indicating a promising rate capability. The low valence Co2+ substitution results in the formation of average Mn3.7+ valence state in Na0.66Co0.22Mn0.44Ti0.34O2, effectively suppressing the Mn3+‐induced Jahn–Teller distortion, and in turn stabilizing the layered structure. X‐ray absorption spectroscopy results suggest that the charge compensation of Na0.66Co0.22Mn0.44Ti0.34O2 during charge/discharge is contributed by Co2.2+/Co3+ and Mn3.3+/Mn4+ redox couples. This is the first time that the highly reversible Co2+/Co3+ redox couple is observed in P2‐layered cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries. This finding may open new approaches to design advanced intercalation‐type cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "Prussian blue and its analogues have received particular attention as superior cathodes for Na-ion batteries due to their potential 2-Na storage capacity (∼170 mAh g(-1)) and low cost. However, most of the Prussian blue compounds obtained from the conventional synthetic routes contain large amounts of Fe(CN)6 vacancies and coordinated water molecules, which leads to the collapse of cyano-bridged framework and serious deterioration of their Na-storage ability. Herein, we propose a facile citrate-assisted controlled crystallization method to obtain low-defect Prussian blue lattice with greatly improved Na-storage capacity and cycling stability. As an example, the as-prepared Na2CoFe(CN)6 nanocrystals demonstrate a reversible 2-Na storage reaction with a high specific capacity of 150 mAh g(-1) and a ∼ 90% capacity retention over 200 cycles, possibly serving as a low cost and high performance cathode for Na-ion batteries.

        "abstract": "Despite their high specific capacity, sodium layered oxides suffer from severe capacity fading when cycled at higher voltages. This key issue must be addressed in order to develop high-performance cathodes for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we present a comprehensive study on the influence of Al doping of Mn sites on the structural and electrochemical properties of a P2-Na0.5Mn0.5-xAlxCo0.5O2 (x = 0, 0.02, or 0.05) cathode for SIBs. Detailed structural, morphological, and electrochemical investigations were carried out using X-ray diffraction, cyclic voltammetry, and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements, and some new insights are proposed. Rietveld refinement confirmed that Al doping caused TMO6 octahedra (TM = transition metal) shrinkage, resulting in wider interlayer spacing. After optimizing the aluminum concentration, the cathode exhibited remarkable electrochemical performance, with better stability and improved rate performance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed at various states of charge to probe the surface and bulk effects of Al doping. The material presented here exhibits exceptional stability over 100 cycles within a 1.5-4.3 V window and outperforms several other Mn-Co-based cathodes for SIBs.

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are considered one of the most promising alternatives for large-scale energy storage due largely to the abundance and low cost of sodium. However, the lack of high-performance cathode materials at low cost represents a major obstacle toward broad commercialization of SIB technology. In this work, we report a green route strategy that allows cost-effective fabrication of carbon-coated Na2FePO4F cathode for SIBs. By using vitamin C as a green organic carbon source and environmentally friendly water-based polyacrylic latex as the binder, we have demonstrated that the Na2FePO4F phase in the as-derived Na2FePO4F/C electrode shows a high reversible capacity of 117 mAh g-1 at a cycling rate of 0.1 C. More attractively, excellent rate capability is achieved while retaining outstanding cycling stability (∼85% capacity retention after 1000 charge-discharge cycles at a rate of 4 C). Further, in operando X-ray diffraction has been used to probe the evolution of phase structures during the charge-discharge process, confirming the structural robustness of the Na2FePO4F/C cathode (even when charged to 4.5 V). Accordingly, the poor initial Coulombic efficiency of some anode materials may be compensated by extracting more sodium ions from Na2FePO4F/C cathode at higher potentials (up to 4.5 V).",

Nonetheless, its application faces a number of obstacles due to poor electronic conductivity and structural instability. In this work, Fe-HCF nanospheres (NSs) were first synthesized and fabricated by an in situ graphene rolls (GRs) wrapping method, forming a 1D tubular hierarchical structure of Fe-HCF NSs@GRs. GRs not only provide fast electronic conduction path for Fe-HCF NSs but also effectively prevent organic electrolyte from reaching active materials and inhibit the occurrence of side reactions. The Fe-HCF NSs@GRs composite has been used as a binder-free cathode with a capacity of ∼110 mAh g-1 at a current density of 150 mA g-1 (∼1C), the capacity retention of ∼90% after 500 cycles. Moreover, the Fe-HCF NSs@GRs cathode displays a super high rate capability with ∼95 mAh g-1 at 1500 mA g-1 (∼10C).

This work provides operando insights into the chemical environment evolution and structure change of SnS2-based anodes, elucidating its reversible reaction mechanism, and illustrates the significance of engineered carbon support in ensuring the electrode structure stability.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Aromatic organic compounds can be used as electrode materials in rechargeable batteries and are expected to advance the development of both anode and cathode materials for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, most aromatic organic compounds assessed as anode materials in SIBs to date exhibit significant degradation issues under fast‐charge/discharge conditions and unsatisfying long‐term cycling performance. Now, a molecular design concept is presented for improving the stability of organic compounds for battery electrodes. The molecular design of the investigated compound, [2.2.2.2]paracyclophane‐1,9,17,25‐tetraene (PCT), can stabilize the neutral state by local aromaticity and the doubly reduced state by global aromaticity, resulting in an anode material with extraordinarily stable cycling performance and outstanding performance under fast‐charge/discharge conditions, demonstrating an exciting new path for the development of electrode materials for SIBs and other types of batteries.",

        "abstract": "Layered NaNi(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(2) (space group: R ̅3m), having an O3-type (α-NaFeO(2) type) structure according to the Delmas' notation, is prepared by a solid-state method. The electrochemical reactivity of NaNi(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(2) is examined in an aprotic sodium cell at room temperature. The NaNi(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(2) electrodes can deliver ca. 105-125 mAh g(-1) at rates of 240-4.8 mA g(-1) in the voltage range of 2.2-3.8 V and show 75% of the initial reversible capacity after 50 charge/discharge cycling tests. In the voltage range of 2.2-4.5 V, a higher reversible capacity of 185 mAh g(-1) is achieved; however, its reversibility is insufficient because of the significant expansion of interslab space by charging to 4.5 V versus sodium. The reversbility is improved by adding fluoroethylene carbonate into the electrolyte solution. The structural transition mechanism of Na(1-x)Ni(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(2) is also examined by an ex situ X-ray diffraction method combined with X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The staking sequence of the [Ni(0.5)Mn(0.5)]O(2) slabs changes progressively as sodium ions are extracted from the crystal lattice. It is observed that the original O3 phase transforms into the O'3, P3, P'3, and P3\" phases during sodium extraction. XAS measurement proves that NaNi(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(2) consists of divalent nickel and tetravalent manganese ions. As sodium ions are extracted from the oxide to form Na(1-x)Ni(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(2), nickel ions are oxidized to the trivalent state, while the manganese ions are electrochemically inactive as the tetravalent state.",

        "abstract": "Due to their low yield and easy aggregation during the electrode preparation process, exfoliated MoS2 monolayers cannot fulfill the requirements of alkali-metal-ion battery tests. Hence, we have developed a facile process to fabricate powder exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets capable of large-scale production and having highly monolayer-rich structures. This process contains two steps: liquid-phase exfoliation of the edge-rich MoS2 precursor and a freeze-drying procedure. The proposed MoS2 precursors contain rich edge fractions that are easily exfoliated by this method, and the freeze-drying procedure can maintain the unique monolayer-rich structure of MoS2 in the powder phase. The electrochemical evaluations of both lithium- and sodium-ion batteries reveal that the proposed powder exfoliated monolayer-rich MoS2 electrode exhibits remarkable specific capacities and stable cyclic performances. In particular, the monolayer-rich MoS2 nanosheet electrode delivers a superior lithium-storage capacity of ∼1400 mA h g-1. The exfoliated MoS2 nanosheet electrode can withstand over 1000 cycles even at 1 A g-1. The mechanism reveals that these unique MoS2 nanosheets not only have a large surface area but also their inclusive monolayer structures exhibit much higher charge mobility than those of bulk MoS2.",

        "abstract": "Polyanionic Na3V2(PO4)2F3 with a NASICON‐type structure is heralded as a promising cathode material for sodium‐ion batteries due to its fast ionic conduction, high working voltage, and favorable structural stability. However, a number of challenging issues remain regarding its rate capability and cycle life, which must be addressed to enable greater application compatibility. Here, a facile and effective approach that can be used to overcome these disadvantages by introducing an aqueous carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binder is reported. The resulting conductive network serves to accelerate the diffusion of Na+ ions across the interface as well as in the bulk. The strong binding force of the CMC and stable solid permeable interface protect the electrode from degradation, leading to an excellent capacity of 75 mA h g−1 at an ultrahigh rate of 70 C (1 C = 128 mA g−1) and a long lifespan of 3500 cycles at 30 C while sustaining 79% of the initial capacity value. A full cell based on this electrode material delivers an impressive energy density as high as 216 W h kg−1, indicating the potential for application of this straightforward and cost‐effective route for the future development of advanced battery technologies.",

By controlling the voltage window, the mesoporous NiS2 nanospheres present excellent electrochemical performance in SIBs. It delivers a high reversible specific capacity of 692 mA h g-1 .

A dominant pseudocapacitance contribution is identified and verified by kinetics analysis. In addition, the amorphization and conversion reactions during the electrochemical process of the mesoporous NiS2 nanospheres is also investigated by in situ X-ray diffraction. The impressive electrochemical performance reveals that the NiS2 offers great potential toward the development of next generation large scale energy storage.",

Although the electrochemical performance of this multi-ion battery may be further enhanced via optimizing electrolyte and electrode materials for example, the results presented clearly indicate the feasibility of this multi-ion strategy to improve the electrochemical performance of SIBs for possible energy storage applications.",

Among the many potential candidates, layered compounds such as MoS2 have attracted increasing attention. However, such materials have not yet fulfilled their true potential. Here, we show that networks of liquid phase exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets, reinforced with 20 wt % single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), can be formed into sodium-ion battery electrodes with large gravimetric, volumetric, and areal capacity. The MoS2/SWNT composite films are highly porous, electrically conductive, and mechanically robust due to its percolating carbon nanotube network. When directly employed as the working electrode, they exhibit a specific capacity of >400 mAh/g and volumetric capacity of ∼650 mAh/cm(3). Their mechanical stability allows them to be processed into free-standing films with tunable thickness up to ∼100 μm, corresponding to an areal loading of 15 mg/cm(2). Their high electrical conductivity allows the high volumetric capacity to be retained, even at high thickness, resulting in state-of-the-art areal capacities of >4.0 mAh/cm(2).

        "abstract": "A sodium-ion battery (SIB) solution is attractive for grid-scale electrical energy storage. Low-cost hexacyanometalate is a promising electrode material for SIBs because of its easy synthesis and open framework. Most hexacyanometalate-based SIBs work with aqueous electrolyte, and interstitial water in the material has been found to strongly affect the electrochemical profile, but the mechanism remains elusive. Here we provide a comparative study of the transition-metal redox in hexacyanometalate electrodes with and without interstitial water based on soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. We found distinct transition-metal redox sequences in hydrated and anhydrated NaxMnFe(CN)6·zH2O. The Fe and Mn redox in hydrated electrodes are separated and are at different potentials, leading to two voltage plateaus. On the contrary, mixed Fe and Mn redox in the same potential range is found in the anhydrated system. This work reveals for the first time how transition-metal redox in batteries is strongly affected by interstitial molecules that are seemingly spectators. The results suggest a fundamental mechanism based on three competing factors that determine the transition-metal redox potentials. Because most hexacyanometalate electrodes contain water, this work directly reveals the mechanism of how interstitial molecules could define the electrochemical profile, especially for electrodes based on transition-metal redox with well-defined spin states.",

Among possible anode materials, Sb is one of the interesting candidates due to a combination of battery-type potential plateaus in the charge-discharge profiles, high capacity (theoretical capacity of 660 mAh g-1), and demonstrated good cyclic stability. The influence of Sb particle size (particularly at the nanoscale range) and the composition of Sb-carbon composites on the electrode performance, stability, and charge storage mechanism is systematically evaluated here for the first time. A range of Sb-carbon nanocomposites with varied Sb particle size (between 50 and ∼1 nm) are studied. The control of the particle size is achieved via varying the carbon and Sb weight ratio in the precursors. The shape of charge-discharge profiles, hysteresis, and the difference in cyclic stabilities and rate performance are analyzed. The nanocomposite with the smallest particle size (∼1 nm) and the largest carbon content provides the most stable cyclic behavior and a better rate capability but suffers from an increased hysteresis between charge and discharge curves. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments indicate that the storage mechanism in the Sb-carbon nanocomposites containing Sb nanoparticles is different from the electrodes with bulkier, micron-sized Sb particles, and the electrochemical reaction proceeds through a number of crystalline intermediates.",

However, the poor cycling stability still limits the development and application in lithium and sodium ion batteries. Here, taking SnS as a model material, a novel general strategy is proposed to fabricate a 3D porous interconnected metal sulfide/carbon nanocomposite by the electrostatic spray deposition technique without adding any expensive carbonaceous materials such as graphene or carbon nanotube. In this way, small nanorods of SnS are generated with sizes of ≈10–20 nm embedded in amorphous carbon and self‐assembled into a 3D porous interconnected nanocomposite. The SnS:C is directly deposited on the Ti foil as a current collector and neither conductive additives nor binder are needed for battery assembly.

Here we reveal a heterogeneous sodiation mechanism of iron fluoride (FeF2) nanoparticle electrodes by combining in situ/ex situ microscopy and spectroscopy techniques. In contrast to direct one-step conversion reaction with lithium, the sodiation of FeF2 proceeds via a regular conversion on the surface and a disproportionation reaction in the core, generating a composite structure of 1-4 nm ultrafine Fe nanocrystallites (further fused into conductive frameworks) mixed with an unexpected Na3FeF6 phase and a NaF phase in the shell.

However, not many materials meet the performance requirements for practical applications. Here, we report a novel sodium-ion battery electrode material, Na(2.55)V(6)O(16)⋅0.6 H(2)O, that shows significant capacities and stabilities at high current rates up to 800 mA g(-1). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements are carried out to better understand the underlying reactions. Moreover, due to the different oxidation states of vanadium, this material can also be employed in a symmetric full cell, which would decrease production costs even further. For these full cells, capacity and stability tests are conducted using various cathode:anode mass ratios.",

        "title": "Biologically derived melanin electrodes in aqueous sodium-ion energy storage devices",
        "abstract": "Significance Here we present important findings related to biologically derived pigments for potential use as battery electrodes. Namely, we report the synthesis, fabrication, and characterization of melanins as materials for use in aqueous sodium-ion batteries. We demonstrate the use of naturally occurring melanins as active electrode materials in charge storage devices. Furthermore, the performance of melanin anodes is comparable to many commonly available synthetic organic electrode materials. The structure–property relationships that govern the storage capacity in melanin materials were also elucidated. These findings suggest that the unique chemistry and nanostructure in natural melanins increase the charge storage capacity compared with synthetic melanin analogues. Biodegradable electronics represents an attractive and emerging paradigm in medical devices by harnessing simultaneous advantages afforded by electronically active systems and obviating issues with chronic implants. Integrating practical energy sources that are compatible with the envisioned operation of transient devices is an unmet challenge for biodegradable electronics. Although high-performance energy storage systems offer a feasible solution, toxic materials and electrolytes present regulatory hurdles for use in temporary medical devices. Aqueous sodium-ion charge storage devices combined with biocompatible electrodes are ideal components to power next-generation biodegradable electronics. Here, we report the use of biologically derived organic electrodes composed of melanin pigments for use in energy storage devices. Melanins of natural (derived from Sepia officinalis) and synthetic origin are evaluated as anode materials in aqueous sodium-ion storage devices. Na+-loaded melanin anodes exhibit specific capacities of 30.4 ± 1.6 mAhg−1. Full cells composed of natural melanin anodes and λ-MnO2 cathodes exhibit an initial potential of 1.03 ± 0.06 V with a maximum specific capacity of 16.1 ± 0.8 mAhg−1. Natural melanin anodes exhibit higher specific capacities compared with synthetic melanins due to a combination of beneficial chemical, electrical, and physical properties exhibited by the former. Taken together, these results suggest that melanin pigments may serve as a naturally occurring biologically derived charge storage material to power certain types of medical devices.",

The creative hybridization of GDY and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) endows the composite with unique heterostructural and morphological advantages that boost the charge transport rate and enhance the battery discharge properties. Electrochemical results indicated that the MoS2@GDY anode displays a considerable discharge capacity of up to 328 mAh g-1 at 1000 mA g-1. A capacity retention of 93% even at testing current back to 200 mA g-1 suggests superior rate characteristics. An outstanding stable cyclic performance of 217 mAh g-1 is obtained at a high testing density.

        "abstract": "Nanocrystals with quantum-confined length scales are often considered impractical for metal-ion battery electrodes due to the dominance of solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer effects on the measured storage properties. Here we demonstrate that ultrafine sizes (∼4.5 nm, average) of iron pyrite, or FeS2, nanoparticles are advantageous to sustain reversible conversion reactions in sodium ion and lithium ion batteries. This is attributed to a nanoparticle size comparable to or smaller than the diffusion length of Fe during cation exchange, yielding thermodynamically reversible nanodomains of converted Fe metal and NaxS or LixS conversion products. This is compared to bulk-like electrode materials, where kinetic and thermodynamic limitations of surface-nucleated conversion products inhibit successive conversion cycles. Reversible capacities over 500 and 600 mAh/g for sodium and lithium storage are observed for ultrafine nanoparticles, with improved cycling and rate capability. Unlike alloying or intercalation processes, where SEI effects limit the performance of ultrafine nanoparticles, our work highlights the benefit of quantum dot length-scale nanocrystal electrodes for nanoscale metal sulfide compounds that store energy through chemical conversion reactions.",

However, due to the limitation of physical adsorption capacity of CDI, the salt removal capacity is unable to reach high value.

Herein, a binder-free DEDI system with two free-standing aerogel electrodes is reported. A Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 /graphene hybrid aerogel is used as sodium electrode and a AgCl/graphene hybrid aerogel is used as chloride electrode. With electric current passing through, sodium and chloride ions are released or absorbed by two aerogel electrodes. This system achieves super high desalination capacity, excellent cycling stability, and rapid desalination rate. The desalination capacity is as high as 107.5 mg g-1 after 50 cycles with the current density of 100 mA g-1 .

Here, copper sulfide is suggested as a superior electrode material with high capacity, high rate, and long‐term cyclability owing to its unique conversion reaction mechanism that is pulverization‐tolerant and thus induces the capacity recovery. Such a desirable consequence comes from the combined effect among formation of stable grain boundaries, semi‐coherent boundaries, and solid‐electrolyte interphase layers. The characteristics enable high cyclic stability of a copper sulfide electrode without any need of size and morphological optimization.

The composition and evolution of the SEI in Na2Ti3O7 electrodes is hereby studied by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). To overcome typical XPS limitations in the photoelectron energy assignments, the analysis of the Auger parameter is here proposed for the first time in battery materials characterization. We have found that the electrode/electrolyte interface formed upon discharge, mostly composed by carbonates and semicarbonates (Na2CO3, NaCO3R), fluorides (NaF), chlorides (NaCl) and poly(ethylene oxide)s, is unstable upon electrochemical cycling. Additionally, solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies prove the reaction of the polyvinylidene difluoride (PVdF) binder with sodium. The powerful approach used in this work, namely Auger parameter study, enables us to correctly determine the composition of the electrode surface layer without any interference from surface charging or absolute binding energy calibration effects. As a result, the suitability for Na-ion batteries of binders and electrolytes widely used for Li-ion batteries is questioned here.",

For sodium‐ion electrodes, however, an amorphous solid may be more advantageous as a result of the open framework to facilitate ion insertion and the ability to tolerate volumetric changes. Herein, it is shown that the Na+ insertion properties of amorphous VO2 (a‐VO2) are superior to those of crystalline VO2(B). Amorphous VO2 exhibits a linear voltage characteristic over a 3 V range (4.0 to 1.0 V vs Na/Na+) leading to a reversible capacity as high as 400 mAh g−1 and rapid redox kinetics, which is attributed to its pseudocapacitive nature. The linear voltage characteristic over 3 V affords the opportunity of fabricating a symmetric Na‐ion battery in which the a‐VO2 material serves as both the positive electrode and the negative electrode. Such a symmetric battery offers safer operation in terms of overcharging, overdischarging, polarity reversal, high charge/discharge current abuse, and long‐term usage. The results suggest that amorphous transition metal oxides may offer advantageous attributes for rapid, safe, and energy‐dense storage.",

Even after a 300-fold current density increased (30 C), the discharge specific capacity of the flexible electrode still remains 63 mA h g-1 .

The exploration of anode materials with efficient electron transportation is essential for improving the performance of SIBs. Inspired by the signal transfer mode of a neuron, we designed a composite by stringing MoS2 nanoflower (soma) with multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) (axons). High-resolution TEM observation reveals a lattice matching growth mechanism of MoS2 nanosheets on the interface of MWCNTs and the lattice expansion of the (002) plane of MoS2. The lattice matching among the MoS2 nanosheet and MWCNT could facilitate electron transfer and structure maintenance upon cycling. The expanded distance of the (002) plane of MoS2 would also promote the sodium-ion intercalation/deintercalation kinetics of the composite. Benefiting from the structural features, when used as an anode material for SIBs, the composite exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, including high specific capacity, excellent cycle stability, and superior rate capabilities. A stable capacity of 527.7 mAh g-1 can be achieved after 110 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g-1.

        "abstract": "Titanium disulfide (TiS2) is investigated as an advanced conversion electrode for sodium (Na)‐ion batteries (NIB) in an ether‐based electrolyte (NaPF6/glyme (DME)). The as‐prepared TiS2 demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 1040 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 with the capacity contribution of 521 mA h g−1 in the voltage region below 1.0 V (vs Na/Na+), remarkable initial coulombic efficiency of 95.9% and superior rate capability of 621 mA h g−1 at 40 A g−1. The high conductivity of the Ti‐based compounds and nanosized particles generated by chemical conversion reactions could minimize the entropic barrier for the reversible conversion, resulting in high reversibility and ultrafast charge/discharge ability of the electrode. Moreover, with its strong ability to adsorb soluble polysulfide intermediates, the as‐prepared TiS2 electrode exhibits superior cycling stability over 9000 cycles, serving as a stable and ultra‐high capacity conversion electrode for NIBs.",

        "abstract": "Stretchable energy‐storage devices receive considerable attention due to their promising applications in future wearable technologies. However, they currently suffer from many problems, including low utility of active materials, limited multidirectional stretchability, and poor stability under stretched conditions. In addition, most proposed designs use one or more rigid components that fail to meet the stretchability requirement for the entire device. Here, an all‐stretchable‐component sodium‐ion full battery based on graphene‐modified poly(dimethylsiloxane) sponge electrodes and an elastic gel membrane is developed for the first time. The battery exhibits reasonable electrochemical performance and robust mechanical deformability; its electrochemical characteristics can be well‐maintained under many different stretched conditions and after hundreds of stretching–release cycles. This novel design integrating all stretchable components provides a pathway toward the next generation of wearable energy devices in modern electronics.",

The structural and electrochemical performances of the electrode material were investigated to establish its applicability in sodium ion capacitors. The electrochemical performance was evaluated using metallic sodium in a half cell configuration which delivered a maximum specific capacitance of 226 F g−1 at 0.03 A g−1. When examined as a symmetric hybrid electrode (full cell) it delivered a maximum capacitance of 55 F g−1 at 0.03 A g−1.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries are now close to replacing lithium-ion batteries because they provide superior alternative energy storage solutions that are in great demand, particularly for large-scale applications. To that end, the present study is focused on the properties of a new type of dual-electrode material, Na0.5Ni0.25Mn0.75O2, synthesized using a mixed hydroxy-carbonate route. Cyclic voltammetry confirms that redox couples, at high and low voltage ranges, are facilitated by the unique features and properties of this dual-electrode, through sodium ion deintercalation/intercalation into the layered Na0.5Ni0.25Mn0.75O2 material. This material provides superior performance for Na-ion batteries, as evidenced by the fabricated sodium cell that yielded initial charge-discharge capacities of 125/218 mAh g-1 in the voltage range of 1.5-4.4 V at 0.5 C. At a low voltage range (1.5-2.6 V), the anode cell delivered discharge-charge capacities of 100/99 mAh g-1 with 99% capacity retention, which corresponds to highly reversible redox reaction of the Mn4+/3+ reduction and the Mn3+/4+ oxidation observed at 1.85 and 2.06 V, respectively. The symmetric Na-ion cell, fabricated using Na0.5Ni0.25Mn0.75O2, yielded initial charge-discharge capacities of 196/187 μAh at 107 μA.

In particular, iron carbodiimide, FeNCN, can be efficiently used as negative electrode material for alkali-metal-ion batteries, similar to its oxide analogue FeO. Based on (57)Fe Mössbauer and infrared spectroscopy (IR) data, the electrochemical reaction mechanism can be explained by the reversible transformation of the Fe-NCN into Li/Na-NCN bonds during discharge and charge. These new electrode materials exhibit higher capacity compared to well-established negative electrode references such as graphite or hard carbon. Contrary to its oxide analogue, iron carbodiimide does not require heavy treatments (such as nanoscale tailoring, sophisticated textures, or coating) to obtain long cycle life with current density as high as 9 A g(-1) for hundreds of charge-discharge cycles. Similar to the iron compound, several other transition-metal carbodiimides M(x)(NCN)y with M=Mn, Cr, Zn can cycle successfully versus lithium and sodium.

Herein, a facile \"ice-assisted\" strategy is presented to prepare highly crystallized PBAs without any additives. By suppressing structure defects, the cathode exhibits a high capacity of 123 mAh g-1 with initial Coulombic efficiency of 87.2%, a long cycling lifespan of 3000 cycles, and significantly enhanced high/low temperature performance and calendar life. Remarkably, the low structure distortion and high sodium diffusion coefficient have been identified via in situ synchrotron powder diffraction and first-principles calculations, while its thermal stability has been analyzed by in situ heated X-ray powder diffraction.

        "abstract": "Developing hard carbon with a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and very good cycling stability is of great importance for practical sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Defects and oxygen-containing groups grown along either the carbon edges or the layers, however, are inevitable in hard carbon and can cause a tremendous density of irreversible Na+ sites, decreasing the efficiency and therefore causing failure of the battery. Thus, eliminating these unexpected defect structures is significant for enhancing the battery performance. Herein, we develop a strategy of applying a soft-carbon coating onto free-standing hard-carbon electrodes, which greatly hinders the formation of defects and oxygen-containing groups on hard carbon. The electrochemical results show that the soft-carbon-coated, free-standing hard-carbon electrodes can achieve an ultrahigh ICE of 94.1% and long cycling performance (99% capacity retention after 100 cycles at a current density of 20 mA g-1), demonstrating their great potential in practical sodium storage systems. The sodium storage mechanism was also investigated by operando Raman spectroscopy. Our sodium storage mechanism extends the \"adsorption-intercalation-pore filling-deposition\" model. We propose that the pore filling in the plateau area might be divided into two parts: (1) sodium could fill in the pores near the inner wall of the carbon layer; (2) when the sodium in the inner wall pores is close to saturation, the sodium could be further deposited onto the existing sodium.",

In lithium cells, only the octahedral structure forms, but in sodium cells, trigonal prismatic structures are also possible. However, there is a lack of understanding about how to predict and control the formation of each structure. Zhao et al. used the simple properties of ions, namely their charge and their radius appropriately weighted by stoichiometry, to determine whether sodium in the interlayers between the transition metal or other ion-oxide layers remain octahedral rather than switching over to trigonal prismatic coordination. Science, this issue p. 708 The energy storage properties of layered oxides are characterized and optimized for cathodes in sodium ion batteries. Sodium-ion batteries have captured widespread attention for grid-scale energy storage owing to the natural abundance of sodium. The performance of such batteries is limited by available electrode materials, especially for sodium-ion layered oxides, motivating the exploration of high compositional diversity. How the composition determines the structural chemistry is decisive for the electrochemical performance but very challenging to predict, especially for complex compositions. We introduce the “cationic potential” that captures the key interactions of layered materials and makes it possible to predict the stacking structures. This is demonstrated through the rational design and preparation of layered electrode materials with improved performance.

Herein, we demonstrate the exceptional performance of Aza-COF in rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Aza-COF is a microporous 2D COF synthesized from hexaketocyclohexane and 1,2,4,5-benzenetetramine by a condensation reaction, which affords phenazine-decorated channels and a theoretical specific capacity of 603 mA h g-1.

The high capacity and energy density are attributed to swift surface-controlled redox processes and rapid sodium-ion diffusion inside the porous electrode. Rate capability studies showed that the battery also performs well at high current rates: 1 C (363 mA h g-1), 5 C (232 mA h g-1), 10 C (161 mA h g-1), and 20 C (103 mA h g-1).

Nevertheless, it is still a significant challenge to obtain superior electrode materials with stable performance owing to the serious volume change and aggregation upon cycling. Herein, a willow-leaf-like nitrogen-doped carbon-coated ZnSe (ZnSe@NC) composite synthesized through facile solvothermal and subsequent selenization process is beneficial to expose more active sites and facilitate the fast electron/ion transmission. These merits significantly enhance the electrochemical performances of ZnSe@NC for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs). The obtained ZnSe@NC exhibits outstanding rate performance (440.3 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and 144.4 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 ) and ultralong cycle stability (242.2 mAh g-1 at 8.0 A g-1 even after 3200 cycles) for SIBs. It is noted that 106.5 mAh g-1 can be retained after 550 cycles and 71.4 mAh g-1 is still remained after 1500 cycles at 200 mA g-1 when applied as anode for PIBs, indicating good cycle stability of the electrode. The possible electrochemical mechanism and the ionic diffusion kinetics of the ZnSe@NC are investigated using ex situ X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and a series of electrochemical analyses.",

        "abstract": "To attain both high energy density and power density in sodium‐ion (Na+) batteries, the reaction kinetics and structural stability of anodes should be improved by materials optimization. In this work, few‐layered molybdenum sulfide selenide (MoSSe) consisting of a mixture of 1T and 2H phases is designed to provide high ionic/electrical conductivities, low Na+ diffusion barrier, and stable Na+ storage. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is used as a conductive matrix to form 3D electron transfer paths. The resulting MoSSe@rGO anode exhibits high capacity and rate performance in both organic and solid‐state electrolytes. The ultrafast Na+ storage kinetics of the MoSSe@rGO anode is attributed to the surface‐dominant reaction process and broad Na+ channels. In situ and ex situ measurements are conducted to reveal the Na+ storage process in MoSSe@rGO. It is found that the MoS and MoSe bonds effectively limit the dissolution of the active materials. The favorable Na+ storage kinetics of the MoSSe@rGO electrode are ascribed to its low adsorption energy of −1.997 eV and low diffusion barrier of 0.087 eV. These results reveal that anion doping of metal sulfides is a feasible strategy to develop sodium‐ion batteries with high energy and power densities and long life‐span.",

The formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in SIBs is still challenging due to the higher solubility of the SEI components compared to lithium analogues. This study therefore aims to shed light on the dissolution of SEI influenced by the electrolyte chemistry. By conducting electrochemical tests with extended open circuit pauses, and using surface spectroscopy, we determine the extent of self‐discharge due to SEI dissolution. Instead of using a conventional separator, β‐alumina was used as sodium‐conductive membrane to avoid crosstalk between the working and sodium‐metal counter electrode. The relative capacity loss after a pause of 50 hours in the tested electrolyte systems ranges up to 30 %. The solubility of typical inorganic SEI species like NaF and Na2CO3 was determined. The electrolytes were then saturated by those SEI species in order to oppose ageing due to the dissolution of the SEI.",

Well‐confined bismuth nanodots are synthesized by replacing cobalt in the metal–organic frameworks (MOF)–derived, nitrogen‐doped carbon arrays, which are demonstrated with remarkable reversibility during sodiation and desodiation. Cobalt species in the pristine MOF catalyze the graphitization around organic components in calcination, generating a highly conductive network in which the bismuth is to be embedded.

        "abstract": "MoS2 has attracted tremendous attention as an anode for Na-ion batteries (NIBs) owing to its high specific capacity and layered graphite-like structure. Herein, MoS2 is converted to a ternary MoS2- xSe x alloy through the selenizing process in order to boost the electrochemical performance for Na-ion batteries. Conversion of MoS2 to MoS2- xSe x expands interlayer spacing, improves electronic conductivity, and creates more defects. The expanded interlayer spacing decreases Na+ diffusion resistance and facilitates Na+ fast transfer. The integrated graphene as a conductive network offers effective pathway for electron migration and maintains structural stability of electrodes during cycles. The ternary MoS1.2Se0.8/graphene (MoS1.2Se0.8/G) electrode demonstrates an extremely high reversible capacity of 509 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 (capacity retention of 109%) as an anode for sodium-ion batteries. Even at 2 A g-1 and after 700 cycles, the MoS1.2Se0.8/G electrode also displays a relatively high reversible capacity of 178 mA h g-1. Full cells assembled with Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathodes and MoS1.2Se0.8/G anodes reveal high charge/discharge capacities. This work demonstrates that the ternary MoS2- xSe x alloy could be a potential anode material for Na-ion storage.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered a prospective candidate for large-scale energy storage due to the merits of abundant sodium resources and low cost. However, a lack of suitable advanced anode materials has hindered further applications. Herein, metal-semiconductor mixed phase twinned hierarchical (MPTH) MoS2 nanowires with an expanded interlayer (9.63 Å) are engineered and prepared using MoO3 nanobelts as a self-sacrificed template in the presence of a trace amount of (NH4 )6 Mo7 O24 ·4H2 O as initiator. The greatly expanded interlayer spacing accelerates Na+ insertion/extraction kinetics, and the metal-semiconductor mixed phase enhances electron transfer ability and stabilizes electrode structure during cycling. Benefiting from the structural merits, the MPTH MoS2 electrode delivers high reversible capacities of 200 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 for 200 cycles and 154 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 for 2450 cycles in the voltage range of 0.4-3.0 V. Strikingly, the electrode maintains 6500 cycles at a current density of 2 A g-1 , corresponding to a capacity retention of 82.8% of the 2nd cycle, overwhelming the all reported MoS2 cycling results.

However, its charge storage mechanism is unclear, hindering further improvement of the cell performance. Here, using in situ transmission electron microscopy and X‐ray diffraction techniques as well as theoretical analysis, it is found that a large anisotropic volume expansion of 142% occurs along the z‐axis largely due to the alloy reaction during sodiation, significantly reducing the electrochemical performance of bismuth electrodes. To address this problem, ultrathin few‐layer bismuthene with a large aspect ratio is rationally synthesized, and can relieve the expansion strain along the z‐axis. A free‐standing bismuthene/graphene composite electrode with tunable thickness achieves a strikingly stable and high areal sodium storage capacity of 12.1 mAh cm−2, which greatly exceeds that of most reported electrode materials. The clarification of the charge storage mechanism and the superior areal capacity achieved should facilitate the development of bismuth‐based high‐performance anodes for practical electrochemical energy‐storage applications.",

The thermodynamic and kinetic stability of monolayer MBenes at room temperature was confirmed by AIMD simulations and phonon spectra. We investigated the potential of two-dimensional MBenes (V, Cr, Mn) as lithium/sodium ion anode electrode materials. Research shows that MBenes have inherent metallic properties, and their mechanical properties indicate that MBenes have high Young's modulus and anisotropy, low diffusion potential and low open-circuit voltage, with outstanding rate performance and good chemical stability in practical applications. In addition, functionalization tends to strongly reduce electrochemical performance and should be avoided as much as possible in experiments. These interesting findings fully demonstrate that the predicted monolayer MBenes are attractive anode materials for lithium/sodium ion batteries.",

To probe the electrochemical properties of NIBs, sodium metal is most frequently applied as the reference and/or counter electrode in state‐of‐the‐art literature. However, the high reactivity of the sodium metal and its impact on the electrochemical performance is usually neglected. In this study, it is shown that spontaneous reactions of sodium metal with organic electrolytes and the importance of critical interpretation of electrochemical experiments is emphasized. When using sodium‐metal half‐cells, decomposition products contaminate the electrolyte during the electrochemical measurement and can easily lead to wrong conclusions about the stability of the active materials. The cycling stability is highly affected by these electrolyte contaminations, which is proven by comparing sodium‐metal‐free cell with sodium‐metal‐containing cells. Interestingly, a more stable cycling performance of the Li4Ti5O12 half‐cells can be observed when replacing the Na metal counter and reference electrodes with activated carbon electrodes. This difference is attributed to the altered properties of the electrolyte as a result of contamination and to different surface chemistries.",

These self-healing batteries are demonstrated to be promising for wearable devices.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion capacitors can potentially combine the virtues of high power capability of conventional electrochemical capacitors and high energy density of batteries. However, the lack of high-performance electrode materials has been the major challenge of sodium-based energy storage devices. In this work, we report a microwave-assisted synthesis of single-crystal-like anatase TiO2 mesocages anchored on graphene as a sodium storage material. The architecture of the nanocomposite results in pseudocapacitive charge storage behavior with fast kinetics, high reversibility, and negligible degradation to the micro/nanostructure. The nanocomposite delivers a high capacity of 268 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C, which remains 126 mAh g-1 at 10 C for over 18 000 cycles. Coupling with a carbon-based cathode, a full cell of sodium-ion capacitor successfully demonstrates a high energy density of 64.2 Wh kg-1 at 56.3 W kg-1 and 25.8 Wh kg-1 at 1357 W kg-1, as well as an ultralong lifespan of 10 000 cycles with over 90% of capacity retention.",

        "title": "Ultrahigh Rate and Long‐Life Sodium‐Ion Batteries Enabled by Engineered Surface and Near‐Surface Reactions",
        "abstract": "To achieve the high‐power sodium‐ion batteries, the solid‐state ion diffusion in the electrode materials is a highly concerned issue and needs to be solved. In this study, a simple and effective strategy is reported to weaken and degrade this process by engineering the intensified surface and near‐surface reactions, which is realized by making use of a sandwich‐type nanoarchitecture composed of graphene as electron channels and few‐layered MoS2 with expanded interlayer spacing. The unique 2D sheet‐shaped hierarchical structure is capable of shortening the ion diffusion length, while the few‐layered MoS2 with expanded interlayer spacing has more accessible surface area and the decreased ion diffusion resistance, evidenced by the smaller energy barriers revealed by the density functional theory calculations. Benefiting from the shortened ion diffusion distance and enhanced electron transfer capability, a high ratio of surface or near‐surface reactions is dominated at a high discharge/charge rate. As such, the composites exhibit the high capacities of 152 and 93 mA h g−1 at 30 and 50 A g−1, respectively. Moreover, a high reversible capacity of 684 mA h g−1 and an excellent cycling stability up to 4500 cycles can be delivered. The outstanding performance is attributed to the engineered structure with increased contribution of surface or near‐surface reactions.",

        "abstract": "Even though advocated as the potential low-cost alternatives to current lithium-ion technology, the practical viability of sodium-ion batteries remains illusive and depends on the development of high-performance electrode materials. Very few candidates available at present can simultaneously meet the requirements on capacity, rate capability, and cycle life. Herein, we report a high-temperature solution method to prepare Ni3S4 nanorods with uniform sizes. These colloidal nanorods readily self-assemble side by side and form microsized superstructures, which unfortunately negates the nanoscale feature of individual nanorods. To this end, we further introduce two-dimensional graphene nanosheets as the spacer to interrupt nanorod self-assembly. Resultant composite presents a marked advantage toward electrochemical storage of Na+ ions. We demonstrate that in half-cells it exhibits large reversible specific capacity in excess of 600 mAh/g, high rate capability with >300 mAh/g retained at 4 A/g, and great cycle life at different current rates. This anode material can also be combined with the NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode in full cells to enable large capacity and good cyclability.",

        "abstract": "Transition-metal sulfides/selenides are explored as advanced electrode materials for nonaqueous sodium-ion capacitors, using FeS2- xSe x as an example. A solid solution of S/Se in FeS2- xSe x allows it to combine the high capacity of FeS2 and the good diffusion kinetics of FeSe2 together, thereby exhibiting excellent cycle stability (∼220 mA h g-1 after 6000 cycles at 2 A g-1) and superior rate capability (∼210 mA h g-1 at 40 A g-1) within 0.8-3.0 V. These results are much better than those of FeS2 and FeSe2, confirming the advantages of S/Se solid solution, as supported by EIS spectra, DFT calculations, and electronic conductivity. As FeS2- xSe x is paired with the activated carbon (AC) as Na-ion capacitors, this device is also better than sodium-ion batteries of FeS2- xSe x//Na3V2(PO4)3 and sodium-ion capacitors of metal oxides//AC, particularly at high rates.

When used as an anode for sodium-ion batteries, the BP/Ti3C2 composite electrode exhibited higher specific capacity and better electrode stability than a BP electrode and a Ti3C2 electrode. The results of experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrated that the synergy of BP and Ti3C2 based on a stable interfacial interaction simultaneously reduces the resistances from both electron and Na+ transport, resulting in the impressive electrochemical performance of the BP/Ti3C2 composite in sodium-ion batteries. The synthesis process and research concept could also be extended for further application of MXene materials and studies on sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Intercalation compounds are popular candidate electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries and other ‘beyond lithium-ion’ technologies including potassium- and magnesium-ion batteries. We summarize first-principles efforts to elucidate the behaviour of such compounds in the layered and spinel structures. Trends based on the size and valence of the intercalant and the ionicity of the host are sufficient to explain phase stability and ordering phenomena, which in turn determine the equilibrium voltage profile. For the layered structures, we provide an overarching view of intercalant orderings in prismatic coordination based on antiphase boundaries, which has important consequences for diffusion. We examine details of stacking sequence transitions between different layered structures by calculating stacking fault energies and discussing the nature of dislocations. A better understanding of these transitions will likely aid the development of batteries with improved cyclability.

        "title": "Sodium/Potassium‐Ion Batteries: Boosting the Rate Capability and Cycle Life by Combining Morphology, Defect and Structure Engineering",
        "abstract": "Carbon‐based materials have been considered as the most promising anode materials for both sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium‐ion batteries (PIBs), owing to their good chemical stability, high electrical conductivity, and environmental benignity. However, due to the large sizes of sodium and potassium ions, it is a great challenge to realize a carbon anode with high reversible capacity, long cycle life, and high rate capability. Herein, by rational design, N‐doped 3D mesoporous carbon nanosheets (N‐CNS) are successfully synthesized, which can realize unprecedented electrochemical performance for both SIBs and PIBs. The N‐CNS possess an ultrathin nanosheet structure with hierarchical pores, ultrahigh level of pyridinic N/pyrrolic N, and an expanded interlayer distance. The beneficial features that can enhance the Na‐/K‐ion intercalation/deintercalation kinetic process, shorten the diffusion length for both ions and electrons, and accommodate the volume change are demonstrated. Hence, the N‐CNS‐based electrode delivers a high capacity of 239 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1 after 10 000 cycles for SIBs and 321 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1 after 5000 cycles for PIBs. First‐principles calculation shows that the ultrahigh doping level of pyridinic N/pyrrolic N contributes to the enhanced sodium and potassium storage performance by modulating the charge density distribution on the carbon surface.",

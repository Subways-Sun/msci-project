        "title": "Biphenylene network as sodium ion battery anode material.",
        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries possess several advantages for large-scale energy storage, such as low cost and enhanced safety. However, graphite or other anode materials are not satisfactory because the large radius of Na+ hinders their embedding and removal in the charge and discharge processes. Recently, a biphenylene network (BPN), a two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotrope, has been synthesized. In this paper, we reveal the potential possibility of BPN as a Na storage material. The theoretical results indicate the advantages of BPN as a sodium battery anode. The maximum specific capacity (413 mA h g-1) is larger than that of the graphite-Li system (372 mA h g-1). With low Na+ diffusion barrier (<0.6 eV) and small volume expansion in the charging process (∼26%), BPN presents superiority to the graphite-Na system. Our findings show new insights into Na storage in BPN and provide guidance for the use of a BPN anode in sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Molybedenum disulfide (MoS2) is regarded as a promising anode material for next-generation sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to its high theoretical capacity. However, its low conductivity, large volume changes, and undesirable phase transformation hinder its practical applications. In this study, we synthesize a hierarchically designed core-shell heterostructure based on nitrogen-doped MoS2/C and silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) (N-MoS2/C@SiOC) via the facile pyrolysis of a suspension of an N-MoS2/polyfurfural precursor in silicone oil. The in situ nitrogen doping in a two-dimensional MoS2 structure with carbon incorporation leads to the enlargement of the interlayer spacing and enhancement of the electronic conductivity and mechanical stability, which allows the facile, highly reversible insertion and extraction of sodium ions upon cycling. Further, the nanoscale SiOC shell with surface capacitive reactivity provides a conductive pathway, preventing unfavorable side reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface and acting as a structure-reinforcing buffer against severe volume expansion issues. As a result, the N-MoS2/C@SiOC composite exhibits high reversible capacity (540.7 mAh g-1), high-capacity retention (>100% after 200 cycles), and excellent rate capability up to 10 A g-1. The simple hierarchical core-shell design strategy developed in this study allows for the fabrication of high-performance metal sulfide anodes as well as other high-capacity anode materials for energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "SnS2 materials have attracted broad attention in the field of electrochemical energy storage due to its layered structure with high specific capacity. However, the easy restacking property during charge/discharge cycling would lead to electrode structure instability and serve capacity decrease. In this paper, we report a simple one-step hydrothermal synthesis of SnS2/graphene/SnS2 (SnS2/rGO/SnS2) composite with ultrathin SnS2 nanosheets covalently decorated on both sides of reduced graphene oxide sheets via C‒S bonds. Owing to the graphene sandwiched between two SnS2 sheets, the composite presents an enlarged interlayer spacing of ~8.03 Å for SnS2, which could facilitate the insertion/extraction of Li+/Na+ ion with rapid transport kinetics, as well as inhibiting the re-stacking of SnS2 nanosheets during the charge/discharge cycling. The density functional theory calculation reveals the most stable state of the moderate interlayer spacing for the sandwich-like composite. The diffusion coefficients of Li/Na-ions from both molecular simulation and experimental observation also demonstrate that that this state is the most suitable for fast ions transport. In addition, numerous ultra-tiny SnS2 nanoparticles anchored on the graphene sheets can generate dominant pseudocapacitive contribution to the composite especially at large current density, guaranteeing its excellent high-rate performance with 844 and 765 mAh g-1 for Li/Na-ion batteries even at 10 A g‒1. No distinct morphology changes occur after 200 cycles, and the SnS2 nanoparticles still recover to pristine phase without distinct agglomeration, demonstrate that this composite with high rate capabilities and excellent cycle stability are the promising candidate for lithium/sodium storage.",

        "abstract": "We report the fabrication of 3D flower-like MoS2 nanosheets arrays on carbon cloth as a binder-free anode for sodium ion battery. Ultrathin and conformal TiO2 layers are used to modify the surface of MoS2 by atomic layer deposition. The electrochemical performance measurements demonstrate that the ALD TiO2 layer can improve the cycling stability and rate capability of MoS2. The MoS2 nanosheets with 0.5-nm TiO2 coating electrode show the highest initial discharge capacity of 1392 mA h g-1 at 200 mA g-1, which is increased by 53% compared with that of bare MoS2. After 150 cycles, the capacity retention rate of the TiO2-coated MoS2 achieves 75.8% of its second cycle's capacity at 200 mA h g-1 in contrast to that of 59% of pure MoS2. Furthermore, the mechanism behind the experimental results is revealed by ex situ scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterizations, which confirms that the ultrathin TiO2 modifications can prevent the structural degradation and the formation of SEI film of MoS2 electrode.",

        "abstract": "Pyrite (FeS2) has been considered as one of the most potential anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) due to its low cost, environmentally friendly features and high theoretical capacity. However, the huge volume changes during a charge/discharge process and poor conductivity of FeS2 hindered its practical applications. Herein, we propose a facile scalable approach to prepare nanostructured FeS2 embedded in an N-doped carbon nanosheet composite (FeS2/CNS) via a combined template method and a solid state sulfuration method. N-Doped carbon nanosheets are believed to alleviate the volume variation and enhance the conductivity of an electrode, and the nanoscale particle size with an average diameter of 50-80 nm can shorten the ion-diffusion paths during a sodiation/desodiation process. As a result, the FeS2/CNS electrode exhibits high specific capacity (812 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), long cycling life (77.2% capacity retention after 350 cycles at 1 A g-1) and excellent rate capability (400 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1) when tested as an anode material for SIBs. The results demonstrate the potential applications of FeS2/CNS in SIBs with low-cost, high power density and long cycling life.",

        "abstract": "Cellulose is a promising natural bio-macromolecule due to its abundance, renewability and low cost. Here, a new method is developed to prepare pre-sodiated carbonaceous anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) from cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) under microwave irradiation for potential ultrafast and large-scale manufacturing. While direct carbonization of CNFs through microwave treatment is usually impossible due to the weak microwave absorption of CNFs, it is found that a small amount of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) can act as an effective initiator. Microwaving rGO releases extremely high energy, giving rise to local ultrahigh temperature as well as ultrahigh heating rate, which then induces the fast carbonization of CNFs and the production of pre-sodiated carbonaceous materials within seconds. The sodium in the carbonaceous materials, introduced from the carbonization of CNFs containing sodium-ion carboxyl, offer favorable spaces for sodiation/desodiation, which improves the electrochemical performance of the sodium-inserted carbonaceous anode. When the microwaved rGO-CNF (MrGO-CNF) is used as an anode for SIBs, a high initial capacity of 558 mAh g-1 is delivered and the capacity of 340 mAh g-1 remains after 200 cycles. The excellent reversible capacity and cycling stability indicate MrGO-CNF a promising anode for sodium-ion batteries.",

The P-CNT hybrid was synthesized through ball-milling of red phosphorus and carboxylic group functionalized carbon nanotubes. The P-O-C bonds formed in this process help maintain contact between phosphorus and CNTs, leading to a durable hybrid. In addition, cross-linked carboxymethyl cellulose-citric acid binder was used to form a robust electrode. As a result, this anode delivers a stable cycling capacity of 1586.2 mAh/g after 100 cycles, along with high initial Coulombic efficiency of 84.7% and subsequent cycling efficiency of ∼99%.

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) is an attractive anode material for low cost and high energy density sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), however, its low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) limits its practical battery application. To overcome this problem, we reported a facile strategy to compensate the irreversible capacity loss of HC anodes simply by a chemical presodiation reaction of the HC electrode with a sodiation reagent (sodium biphenyl, Na-Bp). Benefiting from the strong sodiation ability of Na-Bp, HC anode can be presodiated rapidly in a very short time and the presodiated HC (NaxHC) is found to have a desirable ICE of 100%. When coupled with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode to build a SIB full cell, the NaxHC||Na3V2(PO4)3 cell exhibit a high ICE of ~95.0% and an elevated energy density of 218 Wh kg-1, which is far superior to that of control cell using pristine HC anode (50% ICE and 120 Wh kg-1), suggesting great advantages brought by the chemical presodiation process. More importantly, this presodiation reaction is very mild, highly eﬃcient and can be widely extended to a variety of Na-storage materials, offering a new route to develop high performance Na-storage materials for practical battery applications.",

We found that sodiation tends to inhibit the 1H-to-1T structural phase transition, in contrast to lithiation-induced transition on monolayer MoS2. Thus, VS2 can have better structural stability in the cycles of charging and discharging. Diffussion of Na atom was found to be very fast on both polytypes, with very small diffusion barriers of 0.085 eV (1H) and 0.088 eV (1T). Ab initio random structure searching was performed in order to explore stable configurations of Na on VS2. Our search found that both the V top and the hexagonal center sites are preferred adsorption sites for Na, with the 1H phase showing a relatively stronger binding. Notably, our random structures search revealed that Na clusters can form as a stacked second layer at full Na concentration, which is not reported in earlier works wherein uniform, single-layer Na adsorption phases were assumed. With reasonably high specific energy capacity (232.91 and 116.45 mAh/g for 1H and 1T phases, respectively) and open-circuit voltage (1.30 and 1.42 V for 1H and 1T phases, respectively), VS2 is a promising alternative material for Na-ion battery anodes with great structural sturdiness. Finally, we have shown the capability of the ab initio random structure searching in the assessment of potential materials for energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "Formation of vanadium oxide nanofilm-coated graphene oxide (GO) is achieved by thermally induced explosive disintegration of a microcrystalline ammonium peroxovanadate-GO composite. GO sheets isolate the microcrystalline grains and capture and contain the microexplosion products, resulting in the deposition of the nanoscale products on the GO. Thermal treatment of the supported nanofilm yields a sequence of nanocrystalline phases of vanadium oxide (V3O7, VO2) as a function of temperature. This is the first demonstration of microexplosive disintegration of a crystalline peroxo compound to yield a nanocoating. The large number of recently reported peroxide-rich crystalline materials suggests that the process can be a useful general route for nanofilm formation. The V3O7@GO composite product was tested as a sodium ion battery anode and showed high charge capacity at high rate charge-discharge cycling (150 mAh g-1 at 3000 mA g-1 vs 300 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1) due to the nanomorphology of the vanadium oxide.",

Conventional SnS2 nanomaterials are normally synthesized using hydrothermal method, which is time-consuming and difficult to scale up for mass production. In this study, we develop a simple solid-state reaction method, in which the carbon-coated SnS2 (SnS2/C) anode materials were synthesized by annealing metallic Sn, sulfur powder, and polyacrylonitrile in a sealed vacuum glass tube. The SnS2/C nanospheres with unique layered structure exhibit a high reversible capacity of 660 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 50 mA g(-1) and maintain at 570 mAh g(-1) for 100 cycles with a degradation rate of 0.14% per cycle, demonstrating one of the best cycling performances in all reported SnS2/C anodes for NIBs to date. The superior cycling stability of SnS2/C electrode is attributed to the stable nanosphere morphology and structural integrity during charge/discharge cycles as evidenced by ex situ characterization.",

        "abstract": "Sodium resources are inexpensive and abundant, and hence, sodium-ion batteries are promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries. However, lower energy density and poor cycling stability of current sodium-ion batteries prevent their practical implementation for future smart power grid and stationary storage applications. Tin oxides (SnO2) can be potentially used as a high-capacity anode material for future sodium-ion batteries, and they have the advantages of high sodium storage capacity, high abundance, and low toxicity. However, SnO2-based anodes still cannot be used in practical sodium-ion batteries because they experience large volume changes during repetitive charge and discharge cycles. Such large volume changes lead to severe pulverization of the active material and loss of electrical contact between the SnO2 and carbon conductor, which in turn result in rapid capacity loss during cycling. Here, we introduce a new amorphous carbon-coated SnO2-electrodeposited porous carbon nanofiber (PCNF@SnO2@C) composite that not only has high sodium storage capability, but also maintains its structural integrity while ongoing repetitive cycles. Electrochemical results revealed that this SnO2-containing nanofiber composite anode had excellent electrochemical performance including high-capacity (374 mAh g(-1)), good capacity retention (82.7%), and large Coulombic efficiency (98.9% after 100th cycle).",

        "abstract": "Red phosphorus (P) has attracted intense attention as promising anode material for high‐energy density sodium‐ion batteries (NIBs), owing to its high sodium storage theoretical capacity (2595 mAh g−1). Nevertheless, natural insulating property and large volume variation of red P during cycling result in extremely low electrochemical activity, leading to poor electrochemical performance. Herein, the authors demonstrate a rational strategy to improve sodium storage performance of red P by confining nanosized amorphous red P into zeolitic imidazolate framework‐8 (ZIF‐8) ‐derived nitrogen‐doped microporous carbon matrix (denoted as P@N‐MPC). When used as anode for NIBs, the P@N‐MPC composite displays a high reversible specific capacity of ≈600 mAh g−1 at 0.15 A g−1 and improved rate capacity (≈450 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 1000 cycles with an extremely low capacity fading rate of 0.02% per cycle). The superior sodium storage performance of the P@N‐MPC is mainly attributed to the novel structure. The N‐doped porous carbon with sub‐1 nm micropore facilitates the rapid diffusion of organic electrolyte ions and improves the conductivity of the encapsulated red P. Furthermore, the porous carbon matrix can buffer the volume change of red P during repeat sodiation/desodiation process, keeping the structure intact after long cycle life.",

Here, to realize workable capacity, core-shell (FeSe2 /C) nanostructures are embedded into carbon nanotube (CNT) framework via a facile wet-chemistry approach accompanied by thermally induced selenization. The CNT framework offers 3D continuous routes for electronic/ionic transfer, while macropores provide adequate space for high mass loading of FeSe2 /C. However, the carbon shell not only creates a solid electronic link among CNTs and FeSe2 but also improves the diffusivity of sodium ions into FeSe2 , as well as acts as a buffer cushion to accommodate the volume variations. These unique structural features of CNT/FeSe2 /C make it an excellent host for sodium storage with a capacity retention of 546 mAh g-1 even after 100 cycles at 100 mA g-1 . Moreover, areal and volumetric capacities of 5.06 mAh cm-2 and 158 mAh cm-3 are also achieved at high mass loading 16.9 mg cm-2 , respectively.

        "abstract": "Ultrafine niobium oxide nanocrystals/reduced graphene oxide (Nb2O5 NCs/rGO) was demonstrated as a promising anode material for sodium ion battery with high rate performance and high cycle durability. Nb2O5 NCs/rGO was synthesized by controllable hydrolysis of niobium ethoxide and followed by heat treatment at 450 °C in flowing forming gas. Transmission electron microscopy images showed that Nb2O5 NCs with average particle size of 3 nm were uniformly deposited on rGO sheets and voids among Nb2O5 NCs existed. The architecture of ultrafine Nb2O5 NCs anchored on a highly conductive rGO network can not only enhance charge transfer and buffer the volume change during sodiation/desodiation process but also provide more active surface area for sodium ion storage, resulting in superior rate and cycle performance. Ex situ XPS analysis revealed that the sodium ion storage mechanism in Nb2O5 could be accompanied by Nb(5+)/Nb(4+) redox reaction and the ultrafine Nb2O5 NCs provide more surface area to accomplish the redox reaction.",

        "abstract": "MnO2 is shown for the first time to be electrochemically active as a conversion anode for Na-ion batteries (NIBs). Space-confined ultrafine (UF)-MnO2, with an average crystal size of 4 nm, synthesized using a porous silicon dioxide templated hydrothermal process exhibits a high reversible sodiation capacity of 567 mA h g(-1), in contrast to the negligible activity shown by the aggregates of larger (14 nm) MnO2 nanocrystallites. The remarkably enhanced sodiation activity of the UF-MnO2 is attributable to its greatly reduced crystal size, which facilitates diffusion of Na ions, along with high surface energy arising from extensive heterogeneous interfacial bonding with the SiO2 surrounding. The UF-MnO2 anode exhibits an exceptional rate and cycle performance, exhibiting >70% capacity retention after 500 cycles. In operando synchrotron X-ray absorption near-edge structural analysis reveals combined charge-storage mechanisms involving conversion reaction between Mn(III) and Mn(II) oxides, Mn(III)-O1.5 + Na(+) + e(-)- ↔ 1/2Na2O + Mn(II)-O, and non-Mn-centered redox reactions.

        "title": "Flash Pyrolyzed Coal Char for Sodium Ion Battery Anodes",
        "abstract": "Present day lithium ion batteries face challenges regarding the sustainability, cost, and natural resource availability of their components. Sodium has been shown to be a complementary energy storage material, providing usable volumetric energy density. In designing sodium ion batteries (SIBs), hard carbon is used at the anode in place of graphite, due to the necessary micro domain structure needed to store sodium ions. Coal char is a low cost material and viable source of hard carbon. The use of coal char in SIBs also provides a high value, secondary use pathway for the abundant char component of coal.\n In this work, flash pyrolyzation is explored as a novel approach for coal char synthesis for SIB anodes using a Utah local bituminous coal. During flash pyrolyzation, char is heated in a drop-tube furnace at 1000 oC/s vs. the traditional slow pyrolyzation approach where char is heated at 20 oC/min. Flash pyrolyzed (FP) char has a surface structure that is vastly different in comparison to the slow pyrolyzed (SP) char (Figure 1.), larger d-spacing (FP d-spacing = 0.379 nm, SP d-spacing = 0.364 nm) and a smaller closed micropore diameter (FP micropore = 1.52 nm, SP micropore = 1.91 nm), as concluded from X-ray diffraction (XRD) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis, respectively.\n The SIB performance of FP char vs. SP char is tested and compared in ether-based and ester-based electrolytes. FP char performs better as a SIB anode than SP char in both electrolytes. Additionally, both char anodes achieve higher reversible capacity and better initial coulombic efficiencies (ICE) in an ether-based vs. ester-based electrolyte. When FP char is combined with an ether-based electrolyte, a 10th cycle reversible capacity of 109.4 mAh/g is achieved, whereas a SP char with an ester-based electrolyte cell has a 10th cycle reversible capacity of 72.5 mAh/g, when both cells are cycled at 50 mA/g (sodium metal half-cells). FP ether cells also perform with an initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 64%, but SP ester cells only show an ICE value of 52%. The enhanced electrochemical performance of the FP cells is attributed to differences in surface/bulk structure due to the high heating rate. The improvement in char anode performance in ether-based cells is likely due to the formation of a thinner solid-electrolyte interphase and/or improved sodiation due to an ether-based electrolyte.\n \n \n \n \n \n Figure 1\n",

        "abstract": "The rational design of anode materials is a challenge in developing sodium ion batteries. Alloy anodes provide high gravimetric and volumetric capacities but suffer the short cycle life as a result of the continuous and accumulated pulverization, resulting from a large volume change during the cycling process. Herein, using pure Sn, an irreversible conversion reaction combined with an alloy reaction (SnO), and a reversible conversion reaction combined with an alloy reaction (Sn4P3) as samples, we demonstrate that the pulverization and aggregation of the alloy anode can be partially recovered and the accumulation of pulverization and aggregation during charge/discharge cycles can be terminated using a reversible conversion reaction combined with an alloy reaction. The cycling stability of three Sn-based anodes increases in order of Sn4P3 > SnO > Sn. The enhancement in Sn4P3 can be attributed to a reversible reaction of Sn4P3 + 9Na ↔ 4Sn + 3Na3P, which repairs the cracks, damage, and aggregation of Sn particles that occurred in the alloy process of 4Sn + 15Na ↔ Na15Sn4 during cycling and, hence, terminates the pulverization. The repair mechanism looks like the self-healing feature in nature, where the damage can be healed by itself. Therefore, the suggested mechanism can be called self-healing, while the repaired anode can be termed as the self-healing anode. The use of self-healing strategies to build an electrode architecture is new and highly desirable because it can increase the cycle life and provide a general approach toward stable electrode materials.",

        "abstract": "Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are interesting as one of the alternative metal-ion battery systems to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to the abundance and low cost of potassium. We have herein investigated Sn4P3/C composite as a novel anode material for PIBs. The electrode delivered a reversible capacity of 384.8 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1 and a good rate capability of 221.9 mA h g-1, even at 1 A g-1. Its electrochemical performance is better than any anode material reported so far for PIBs. It was also found that the Sn4P3/C electrode displays a discharge potential plateau of 0.1 V in PIBs, slightly higher than for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) (0.01 V), and well above the plating potential of metal. This diminishes the formation of dendrites during cycling, and thus Sn4P3 is a relatively safe anode material, especially for application in large-scale energy storage, where large amounts of electrode materials are used. Furthermore, a possible reaction mechanism of the Sn4P3/C composite as PIB anode is proposed. This work may open up a new avenue for further development of alloy-based anodes with high capacity and long cycle life for PIBs.",

However, the low intrinsic conductivity and easy‐agglomerated feature hamper its applications. Here, a charge‐driven interlayer expansion strategy that Co2+ replaces Mo4+ in the doping form to endow MoS2 layers with negative charges, thus inducing electrostatic repulsion, together with the insertion of gaseous groups, to drive interlayer expansion which once breaks the confinement of interlayer van der Waals force, single‐layered MoS2 is obtained and uniformly dispersed into carbon matrix arising from the transformation of carbonaceous gaseous groups under high vapor pressure, is proposed. Co atom doping helps enhance the intrinsic conductivity of single‐layered MoS2. Carbon matrix effectively prevents agglomeration of single‐layered MoS2. The doped Co atoms can be fully transformed into ultrasmall Co nanoparticles during conversion reaction, which enables strong spin‐polarized surface capacitance and thus significantly boosts ion transport and storage. Consequently, the prepared material delivers superb Li/Na/K‐ion storage performances, which are best in the reported MoS2‐based anodes. The proposed charge‐driven interlayer expansion strategy provides a novel perspective for preparing single‐layered MoS2, which shows huge potential for energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) show practical applications in large‐scale energy storage systems. But, their power density is limited by the sluggish Na+ diffusion into the cathode and anode materials. Herein, the authors demonstrate a prototype of ultrahigh power SIB, consisting of the high‐rate Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode, graphite‐type mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB) anode, and Na+‐diglyme electrolyte. It is found that the overpotential of the NVP cathode obeys the Ohmic rule. Thus, the as‐synthesized NVP@C@carbon nanotubes (CNTs) cathode with the high conductive CNTs networks displays high electronic conductivity, reducing the overpotential and charge transfer resistances and leading to the remarkable rate capability over 1000C. For the MCMB anode, the initial [Na‐diglyme]+ co‐intercalation step is pseudocapacitive dominated, and then the expanded graphite's layers ensure the subsequent fast ions diffusion. The rapid (de)intercalation kinetics in between the cathode and anode are well‐matched. Thus, the assembled MCMB|1 m NaPF6 in diglyme|NVP@C@CNTs full‐cell SIB delivers the energy density of 88 Wh kg−1 at the high power density of ≈10 kW kg−1. Even at the ultrahigh power density of 23 kW kg−1, an energy density of 58 Wh kg−1 is obtained. The encouraging results of the full cell will promote the development of high‐power SIB for large‐scale applications in the future.",

These methods target various length‐ and time scales, ranging from micro to nano, from cell level to atomistic structures, and account for a broad spectrum of physical and (electro)chemical characteristics. Specifically, how mass spectrometric, microscopic, spectroscopic, electrochemical, thermodynamic, and physical methods can be employed to obtain the various types of information required to understand battery behavior will be explored.

        "title": "Tuning the electronic energy level of covalent organic frameworks for crafting high-rate Na-ion battery anode.",
        "abstract": "Crystalline Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) possess ordered accessible nano-channels. When these channels are decorated with redox-active functional groups, they can serve as the anode in metal ion batteries (LIB and SIB). Though sodium's superior relative abundance makes it a better choice over lithium, the energetically unfavourable intercalation of the larger sodium ion makes it incompatible with the commercial graphite anodes used in Li-ion batteries. Also, their sluggish movement inside the electrodes restricts the fast sodiation of SIB. Creating an electronic driving force at the electrodes via chemical manipulation can be a versatile approach to overcome this issue. Herein, we present anodes for SIB drawn on three isostructural COFs with nearly the same Highest Occupied Molecular Orbitals (HOMO) levels but with varying Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbitals (LUMO) energy levels. This variation in the LUMO levels has been deliberately obtained by the inclusion of electron-deficient centers (phenyl vs. tetrazine vs. bispyridine-tetrazine) substituents into the modules that make up the COF. With the reduction in the cell-potential, the electrons accumulate in the anti-bonding LUMO. Now, these electron-dosed LUMO levels become efficient anodes for attracting the otherwise sluggish sodium ions from the electrolyte. Also, the intrinsic porosity of the COF favors the lodging and diffusion of the Na+ ions. Cells made with these COFs achieve a high specific capacity (energy density) and rate performance (rapid charging-discharging), something that is not as easy for Na+ compared to the much smaller sized Li+. The bispyridine-tetrazine COF with the lowest LUMO energy shows a specific capacity of 340 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 and 128 mA h g-1 at a high current density of 15 A g-1. Only a 24% drop appears on increasing the current density from 0.1 to 1 A g-1, which is the lowest among all the top-performing COF derived Na-ion battery anodes.",

        "abstract": "To design a high-performance sodium-ion battery (SIB) anode, binary zinc phosphides (ZnP2 and Zn3P2) were synthesized by a facile solid-state heat treatment process, and their Na storage characteristics were evaluated. The Na reactivity of ZnP2 was better than that of Zn3P2. Therefore, a C-modified ZnP2-based composite (ZnP2-C) was fabricated to achieve better electrochemical performance. To investigate the electrochemical reaction mechanism of ZnP2-C during sodiation/desodiaiton, various ex-situ analytical techniques were employed. During sodiation, ZnP2 in the composite was transformed into NaZn13 and Na3P phases, exhibiting a one-step conversion reaction. Conversely, Zn and P in the NaZn13 and the Na3P, respectively, were fully recombined to the original ZnP2 phase during desodiation. Owing to the one-step conversion/recombination of ZnP2 in the composite during cycling, ZnP2-C showed high electrochemical performance with a highly reversible capacity of 883 mAh g-1 after 130 cycles with no capacity deterioration and a fast C-rate capability of 500 mAh g-1 at 1C and 350 mAh g-1 at 3C.",

        "abstract": "Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2 ), a 2D-layered compound, is regarded as a promising anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its attractive theoretical capacity and low cost. The main challenges associated with MoS2 are the low rate capability suffering from the sluggish kinetics of Na+ intercalation and the poor cycling stability owning to the stack of MoS2 sheets. In this work, a unique architecture of bundled defect-rich MoS2 (BD-MoS2 ) that consists of MoS2 with large vacancies bundled by ultrathin MoO3 is achieved via a facile quenching process. When employed as anode for a SIB, the BD-MoS2 electrode exhibits an ultrafast charge/discharge due to the pseudocapacitive-controlled Na+ storage mechanism in it. Further experimental and theoretical calculations show that Na+ is able to cross the MoS2 layer by vacancies, not only limited to diffusion along the layer, thus realizing a 3D Na+ diffusion with faster kinetics. Meanwhile, the bundling architecture reduces the stack of sheets with a superior cycle life illustrating the highly reversible capacities of 350 and 272 mAh g-1 at 2 and 5 A g-1 after 1000 cycles.",

Several material properties such as intensity ratio of the Raman spectrum, lateral size of HC crystallite (La ), and interlayer distance (d002 ) have been discussed as factors affecting anode performance. However, these factors do not reflect the bulk property of the Na+ intercalation reaction directly, since Raman analysis has high surface sensitivity and La and d002 provide only one-dimensional crystalline information. Herein, it was proposed that the crystallite interlayer area (Ai ) defined using La , d002 , and stacking height (Lc ) governs Na+ intercalation behavior of various HCs. It was revealed that various wood-derived HCs exhibited the similar total capacity of approximately 250 mAh g-1 , whereas the Na+ intercalation capacity (Ci ) was proportional to Ai with the correlation coefficient of R2 =0.94. The evaluation factor of Ai was also adaptable to previous reports and strongly correlated with their Ci , indicating that Ai is more widely adaptable than the conventional evaluation methods.",

However, the 2D graphene sheet only allows the rapid diffusion of sodium ions along the parallel direction while that of the vertical direction is difficult, limiting the rate capability of graphene‐based electrode materials. To tackle this problem, pore‐forming engineering has been employed to perforate graphene and concurrently achieve the in situ growth of Co3Se4 nanoparticles. The generation of in‐plane nanohole breaks through the physical barriers of the graphene nanosheets, enabling the fast diffusion of electrolyte ions in the longitudinal direction. In addition, this design limits the aggregation of Co3Se4 nanoparticles because of the high affinity of Co3Se4 on graphene. Benefiting from the high conductivity and fast ion transport bestowed by the ingenious architecture, the Co3Se4/holey graphene exhibits a remarkable rate performance of 519.5 mAh g−1 at 5.0 A g−1 and desirable cycle stability.

In this regard, iron oxides (FeOx) are considered as one of the most promising anode candidates due to its high theoretical capacity and low cost. Unfortunately, the utilization of FeOx anodes suffers from sluggish reaction kinetics and significant lattice variation, causing insufficient rate performance and fast capacity degradation during the sodiation/desodiation process. In this study, Mn ions are incorporated through interstitial sites into Fe3O4 lattice to form the Mn-incorporated Fe3O4/graphene (M-Fe3O4/G) composites through a facile hydrothermal method. Confirmed by the XRD Rietveld refinement and the first principle calculation, Mn occupation into the body structure can effectively condense the electron density around Fermi lever and thus contributes to the increased electrical conductivity and improved electrochemical properties. Accordingly, the M0.1Fe2.9O4/G composite demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 439.8 mAh g-1 at a current density of 100 mA g-1 over 200 cycles. Even at a high current density of 1 A g-1, the M-Fe3O4/G composites remain stable for over 1200 cycles, delivering a capacity of 210 mAh g-1. Coupled with Na3V2(PO4)3-type cathode, the Mn incorporated Fe3O4/G composites demonstrate a good suitability in full SIBs (161.2 mAh g-1 at the current density of 1 A g-1 after 100 cycles).

At higher current densities of 2, 5, and 10 A g-1, the Sb@(N, S-C) hybrid also can display high reversible capacities of 534.4, 430.8, and 374.7 mAh g-1, respectively. Such impressive sodium storage properties are mainly attributed to the unique cross-linked carbon networks providing highly conductive frameworks for fast transfer of ions and electrons, alleviating the volume expansion and preventing the agglomeration of Sb nanorods during the cycling.",

        "title": "Plasma-Induced Oxygen Vacancies in Urchin-Like Anatase Titania Coated by Carbon for Excellent Sodium-Ion Battery Anodes.",
        "abstract": "The incorporation of oxygen vacancies in anatase TiO2 has been studied as a promising way to accelerate the transport of electrons and Na+ ions, which is important for achieving excellent electrochemical properties for anatase TiO2. However, wittingly introducing oxygen vacancies in anatase TiO2 for sodium-ion anodes by a facile and effective method is still a challenge. In this work, we report an innovative method to introduce oxygen vacancies into the urchin-like N-doped carbon coated anatase TiO2 (NC-DTO) by a facile plasma treatment. The superiorities of the oxygen vacancies combined with the conductive N-doped carbon coating enable the obtained NC-DTO of greatly improved sodium storage performance. When served as the anode for sodium-ion batteries, the NC-DTO electrode shows superior electrochemical performance (capacity: 272 mA h g-1 at 0.25 C, capacity retention: 98.8% after 5000 cycles at 10 C, as well as ultrahigh capacity: 150 mA h g-1 at 15 C). Density functional theory calculations combined with experimental results suggest that considerably improved sodium storage performance of NC-DTO is due to the enhanced electronic conductivity from the N-doped carbon layer as well as narrowed band gap and lowered sodiation energy barrier from the introduction of oxygen vacancies. This work highlights that introducing oxygen vacancies into TiO2 by plasma is a promising method to enhance the electrochemical property of TiO2, which also can be applied to different metal oxides for energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "Black phosphorus (BP) has recently aroused researchers' great interest as promising anode material for sodium-ion battery (SIB), owing to its high theoretical capacity (2596 mAh g-1) and good electric conductivity (about 300 S m-1). However, the large volume variation during electrochemical cycling makes it difficult to use for practical applications. Herein, the reversible performance of BP in SIB is significantly enhanced by bridging covalently functionalized BP on graphene. The enhanced interaction between the chemical functionalized BP and graphene improves the stability of BP during long-cycle running of SIB. The bridging reduces the surface energy and increases thickness of BP available for enlarging the channel between BP nanosheet and graphene. The enlarged channel stores more sodium ions for improving cycle performance. Significantly, two types of phosphorus-carbon bond are first detected during experimental analysis. Benefiting from the strategy, the BP-based SIB anode exhibits 1472 mAh g-1 specific capacity at 0.1 A g-1 in the 50th cycle and 650 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 200 cycles.",

Phosphorus (P) is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries, with a theoretical capacity of 2596 mAh/g. The red phosphorus (RP) form has worse electronic conductivity and lower initial Coulombic efficiency than black phosphorus (BP), but high material cost and limited production capacity have slowed the development of BP anodes. To address these challenges, we have developed a simple and scalable method to synthesize layered BP/graphene composite (BP/rGO) by pressurization at room temperature.

        "abstract": "Electrodes with higher Na + storage capability and cycling stability are vital to improve the energy density and rate capability of sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we present a coral-like FeP composite with FeP nanoparticles anchored and dispersed on a nitrogen-doped three-dimensional carbon framework ( FeP@NC ). Due to the highly continuous N-doped carbon framework and a spring-buffering graphitized carbon layer around the FeP nanoparticle, the sodium ion battery with FeP@NC composite can exhibit an ultra-stable cycling performance at 10 A g -1 with a capacity retention of 82.0% in 10000 cycles. More importantly, an interesting particle refinement achieving capacity increasing mechanism during cycling has been well confirmed. Particularly, the FeP nanoparticles go through a refining-recombination process during the first cycle and present a global refining trend after dozens of cycles, which results in a gradually increase in graphitization degree and interface magnetization, and further provides more extra active sites for Na + storage and contributes to a rising capacity with cycling . The capacity ascending phenomenon can also extend to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). This paper holds a new feasibility insight mechanism of the enhanced capacity during cycling and also offers a feasible solution to design high performance anode material for SIBs/LIBs.",

        "abstract": "Developing hard carbon with a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and very good cycling stability is of great importance for practical sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Defects and oxygen-containing groups grown along either the carbon edges or the layers, however, are inevitable in hard carbon and can cause a tremendous density of irreversible Na+ sites, decreasing the efficiency and therefore causing failure of the battery. Thus, eliminating these unexpected defect structures is significant for enhancing the battery performance. Herein, we develop a strategy of applying a soft-carbon coating onto free-standing hard-carbon electrodes, which greatly hinders the formation of defects and oxygen-containing groups on hard carbon. The electrochemical results show that the soft-carbon-coated, free-standing hard-carbon electrodes can achieve an ultrahigh ICE of 94.1% and long cycling performance (99% capacity retention after 100 cycles at a current density of 20 mA g-1), demonstrating their great potential in practical sodium storage systems. The sodium storage mechanism was also investigated by operando Raman spectroscopy. Our sodium storage mechanism extends the \"adsorption-intercalation-pore filling-deposition\" model. We propose that the pore filling in the plateau area might be divided into two parts: (1) sodium could fill in the pores near the inner wall of the carbon layer; (2) when the sodium in the inner wall pores is close to saturation, the sodium could be further deposited onto the existing sodium.",

Up to the present, the anode material still remains a great challenge for the application of SIBs, especially at room temperature. Graphite has an obvious limitation to store larger radius sodium ions (Na+) in comparison with lithium ions (Li+), while the hard carbon with large interlayer distance can demonstrate a relatively high storage capability and durable cycle life. However, the disadvantages of low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) mainly caused by large surface area and high cost synthetic approach hinder its practical applications. Herein, a new coupled carbonization strategy is presented to prepare a cost-effective hard carbon material by pyrolyzing and carbonizing the mixture of abundant sucrose and phenolic resin. Benefiting from the specialized pyrolysis reaction process and optimized conditions as studied in detail, the hard carbon has an extremely low surface area of 1.54 m2 g-1 and high initial Coulombic efficiency of 87%, which have been rarely reported before and enhance the utilization efficiency of Na+ consumption within the cathode in the future. More importantly, the hard carbon, with a high interlayer distance 3.95 Å, can deliver a higher capacity of 319 mAh g-1 and maintain a finer capacity retention of 90% over 150 cycles. Besides, a full cell with the configuration of as-prepared hard carbon anode versus an air-stable O3-Na0.9[Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48]O2 cathode is further presented, and it has a high ICE of 80% and energy density of 256 Wh kganode-1 (vs hard carbon) with reliable cycle performance.

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (NIB, NAB, SIB) are attracting interest as a potentially lower cost alternative to lithium ion batteries (LIB), with readily available and geographically democratic reserves of the metal. Tin is one of most promising SIB anode materials, which alloys with up to 3.75 Na, leading to a charge storage capacity of 847 mAh g(-1). In this Account, we outline the state-of-the-art understanding regarding the sodiation-induced phase transformations and the associated performance in a range of Sn-based systems, treating metallic Sn and its alloys, tin oxide (SnO2), tin sulfide (SnS2/SnS), and tin phosphide (Sn4P3). We first detail what is known about the sodiation sequence in metallic Sn, highlighting the most recent insight into the reactions prior to the terminal equilibrium Na15Sn4 intermetallic. We explain why researchers argue that the equilibrium (phase diagram) series of phase transitions does not occur in this system, and rather why sodiation/desodiation proceeds through a series of metastable crystalline and amorphous structures. We also outline the recent modeling-based insight regarding how this phase transition profoundly influences the mechanical properties of the alloy, progressively changing the bonding and the near neighbor arrangement from \"Sn-like\" to \"Na-like\" in the process. We then go on to discuss the sodiation reactions in SnO2. We argue that while a substantial amount of experimental work already exists where the focus is on synthesis and testing of tin oxide-based nanocomposites, the exact sodiation sequence is just beginning to be understood. Unlike in Sn and Sn alloys, where capacities near the theoretical are reached at least early during cycling, SnO2 never quite achieves anything close to the 1398 mAh g(-1) that would be possible with a combination of fully reversible conversion and alloying reactions. We highlight recent work demonstrating that contrary to general expectations, it is the Sn to Na15Sn4 alloying reaction that is incomplete and hence limits the capacity of the electrode. We also describe how the oxide conversion reaction goes through an intermediate SnO phase, and how its reversibility in a half-cell is highly dependent on the terminal anodic voltage. We then present what is known about sodiation of tin sulfide and of tin phosphide phases, including emerging microstructural evidence that may explain why both the sulfides and the phosphides are unable to achieve their highly promising theoretical capacities under conventional electrode testing conditions. Finally, we provide a broad comparison of the capacity (cycling and rate) performance for a range of Sn based anode materials, and show that there may be indeed an optimum microstructural architecture.",

By introducing a TiO2 shell on metal-organic framework (Fe-MOF) nanorods by sol-gel deposition and subsequent solid-state annealing treatment of these core-shell Fe-MOF@TiO2, such well-defined FTO⊂CNTs are obtained. The achieved FTO⊂CNT electrode has several distinct advantages including a hollow interior in the hybrid nanostructure, fully encapsulated ultrasmall electroactive units, flexible conductive carbon matrix, and stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) of FTO in cycles. FTO⊂CNT electrodes present an excellent cycle stability (358.8 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at 100 mA g-1) and remarkable rate capability (201.8 mA h g-1 at 5000 mA g-1) with a high Coulombic efficiency of approximately 99%. In addition, combined with the typical Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode to constitute full SIBs, the assembled FTO⊂CNT//Na3V2(PO4)3 batteries are also demonstrated with superior rate capability and a long cycle life.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries are promising futuristic large-scale energy-storage devices because of the abundance and low cost of sodium. However, the development and commercialization of the sodium-ion battery solely depends on the use of high-capacity electrode materials. Among the various metal oxides, SnO2 has a high theoretical specific capacity for sodium-ion battery. However, the enormous volume expansion and low electrical conductivity of SnO2 hinder its capability to reach the predicted theoretical value. Although different nanostructured designs of electrode materials like SnO2 nanocomposites have been studied, the effects of other cell components like electrolyte and binder on the specific capacity and cyclic stability are yet to be understood. In the present study, we have investigated the synergistic effect of electrolyte and binder on the performance enhancement of SnO2 supported on the intertwined network structure of reduced graphene oxide partially open multiwalled carbon nanotube hybrid as anode in sodium-ion battery. Our result shows that sodium carboxyl methyl cellulose and ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate as the electrolyte solvent offers a high specific capacity of 688 mAh g–1 and a satisfactory cyclic stability for 500 cycles. This is about 56% enhancement in specific capacity compared to the use of poly(vinylidene fluoride) binder and propylene carbonate as the electrolyte solvent. The present study provides a better understanding of the synergistic role of electrolyte and binder for the development of metal-oxide-based electrode materials for the advancement of the commercialization of sodium-ion battery.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries are now considered as a low‐cost alternative to lithium‐ion technologies for large‐scale energy storage applications; however, their safety is still a matter of great concern for practical applications. In this paper, a safer sodium‐ion battery is proposed by introducing a nonflammable phosphate electrolyte (trimethyl phosphate, TMP) coupled with NaNi0.35Mn0.35Fe0.3O2 cathode and Sb‐based alloy anode. The physical and electrochemical compatibilities of the TMP electrolyte are investigated by igniting, ionic conductivity, cyclic voltammetry, and charge–discharge measurements. The results exhibit that the TMP electrolyte with FEC additive is completely nonflammable and has wide electrochemical window (0–4.5 V vs. Na/Na+), in which both the Sb‐based anode and NaNi0.35Mn0.35Fe0.3O2 cathode show high reversible capacity and cycling stability, similarly as in carbonate electrolyte. Based on these results, a nonflammable sodium‐ion battery is constructed by use of Sb anode, NaNi0.35Mn0.35Fe0.3O2 cathode, and TMP + 10 vol% FEC electrolyte, which works very well with considerable capacity and cyclability, demonstrating a promising prospect to build safer sodium‐ion batteries for large‐scale energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "Structural phase transitions can be used to alter the properties of a material without adding any additional elements and are therefore of significant technological value. It was found that the hexagonal-SnS2 phase can be transformed into the orthorhombic-SnS phase after an annealing step in an argon atmosphere, and the thus transformed SnS shows enhanced sodium-ion storage performance over that of the SnS2, which is attributed to its structural advantages. Here, we provide the first report on a SnS@graphene architecture for application as a sodium-ion battery anode, which is built from two-dimensional SnS and graphene nanosheets as complementary building blocks. The as-prepared SnS@graphene hybrid nanostructured composite delivers an excellent specific capacity of 940 mAh g(-1)and impressive rate capability of 492 and 308 mAh g(-1) after 250 cycles at the current densities of 810 and 7290 mA g(-1), respectively. The performance was found to be much better than those of most reported anode materials for Na-ion batteries. On the basis of combined ex situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and ex situ X-ray diffraction, the formation mechanism of SnS@graphene and the synergistic Na-storage reactions of SnS in the anode are discussed in detail. The SnS experienced a two-structural-phase transformation mechanism (orthorhombic-SnS to cubic-Sn to orthorhombic-Na3.75Sn), while the SnS2 experienced a three-structural-phase transformation mechanism (hexagonal-SnS2 to tetragonal-Sn to orthorhombic-Na3.75Sn) during the sodiation process. The lesser structural changes of SnS during the conversion are expected to lead to good structural stability and excellent cycling stability in its sodium-ion battery performance. These results demonstrate that the SnS@graphene architecture offers unique characteristics suitable for high-performance energy storage application.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing use of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), developing cost-effective anode materials, such as metal oxide, for Na-ion storage is one of the most attractive topics. Due to the obviously larger ion radius of Na than that of Li, most metal oxide electrode materials fail to exhibit the same high performance for SIBs like that of Li-ion batteries. Herein, iron oxide was employed to demonstrate a concept that rationally designing an amorphous structure should be useful to enhance Na-ion storage performance of a metal oxide. Amorphous Fe2O3/graphene composite nanosheets (Fe2O3@GNS) were successfully synthesized by a facile approach as anodes for SIBs. It reveals that amorphous Fe2O3 nanoparticles with an average diameter of 5 nm were uniformly anchored on the surface of graphene nanosheets by the strong C-O-Fe oxygen-bridge bond. Compared to well-crystalline Fe2O3, amorphous Fe2O3@GNS exhibited superior sodium storage properties such as high electrochemical activity, high initial Coulombic efficiency of 81.2%, and good rate performance. At a current density of 100 mA/g, amorphous Fe2O3@GNS composites show a specific capacity of 440 mAh/g, which is obviously higher than the specific capacity of 284 mAh/g of crystalline Fe2O3. Even at a high current density of 2 A/g, amorphous Fe2O3@GNS composites still exhibit a specific capacity as high as 219 mAh/g. The excellent electrochemical performance should be attributed to the amorphous structures of Fe2O3 as well as strongly interfacial interaction between Fe2O3 and GNS, which not only accommodate more electrochemical active sites and provide the more transmission channels for sodium ions but also benefit electron transfer as well as effectively buffer the volume change of host materials during sodiation and desodiation. This concept for designing amorphous iron oxide anodes for SIBs is also expected to facilitate preparation of various amorphous nanostructure of other metal oxides and improve their Na-ion storage performance.",

The reaction activation energies, Gibbs free energies, enthalpies, and structures of the transition states are calculated. It is indicated that VC, ES, and PS additives in the electrolyte are all easier to form organic components in the anode SEI film by one-electron reduction. The priority of one-electron reduction to produce organic SEI components is in the order of VC>PC>EC; two-electron reduction to produce the inorganic Na2 CO3 component is different and follows the order of EC>PC>VC. Two-electron reduction for sulfites ES and PS to form inorganic Na2 SO3 is harder than that of carbonate ester reduction.

Hard carbon (HC), which is low cost, exhibits a low redox potential, and a high capacity, is integral to achieve a practical large‐scale sodium‐ion battery. However, the energy density of the battery utilizing this anode material is hampered by its low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). Herein, two strategies, namely i) additional pyrolysis and ii) presodiation by thermal decomposition of NaBH4, are explored to improve the ICE of pristine HC. Raman spectroscopy, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrochemical characterizations elucidate that the thermal treatment increases the Csp2 content in the HC structure, while the presodiation supplies the sodium to occupy the intrinsic irreversible sites. Consequently, presodiated HC exhibits an outstanding ICE (>99%) compared to the thermally treated (90%) or pristine HC (83%) in half‐cell configurations. More importantly, AS3iB using presodiated HC and NaCrO2 as the anode and cathode, respectively, exhibits a high ICE of 92% and an initial discharge energy density of 294Whkgcathode−1$294\\ {\\rm Wh}\\ {\\rm{kg}}_{{\\rm{cathode}}}^{ - 1}$ .",

Electrospinning is a promising technology for preparing freestanding electrodes with high gravimetric and volumetric energy density. However, the energy density of the traditional electrospun electrodes is restricted by the low mass loading of active materials (e.g. 20%-30 wt%). Herein, a biomimetic strategy inspired by the phenomenon of the sticky spider web is demonstrated as a high performance anode, which simultaneously improves the gravimetric and volumetric energy density. Freestanding carbon nanofiber (CNF) membranes containing over 50 wt% of bismuth were prepared by electrospinning and subsequent thermal treatment. Membranes consisting of CNF network structures bonded tightly with active Bi cluster materials, resulting in excellent mechanical protection and a fast charge transport path, which are difficult to achieve simultaneously.

However, the lack of effective exfoliation methods for obtaining 2D materials in a large quantity has been one of the technical barriers for the real applications. We report a facile liquid-phase exfoliation method to improve the exfoliation efficiency for single-layer MoS2 sheets in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) with a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) assistant. The concentration of the exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets was greatly improved compared to that achieved with conventional liquid-phase exfoliation methods using NMP solvent.

        "abstract": "The utilization of oxygen vacancies (OVs) in sodium ion batteries (SIBs) is expected to enhance performance, but as yet it has rarely been reported. Taking the MoO(3-x) nanosheet anode as an example, for the first time we demonstrate the benefits of OVs on SIB performance. Moreover, the benefits at deep-discharge conditions can be further promoted by an ultrathin Al2O3 coating. A series of measurements show that the OVs increase the electric conductivity and Na-ion diffusion coefficient, and the promotion from ultrathin coating lies in the effective reduction of cycling-induced solid-electrolyte interphase. The coated nanosheets exhibited high reversible capacity and great rate capability with the capacities of 283.9 (50 mA g(-1)) and 179.3 mAh g(-1) (1 A g(-1)) after 100 cycles. This work may not only arouse future attention on OVs for sodium energy storage, but also open up new possibilities for designing strategies to utilize defects in other energy storage systems.",

Herein, we report a systemic investigation on the different types of heterostructure interfaces' effects of discharging products (Na2O, Na2S, Na2Se) on the rate performance. First-principle calculations reveal that the Na2S/Na2Se interface possesses the lowest diffusion energy barrier (0.39 eV) of Na among three kinds of interface structures (Na2O/Na2S, Na2O/Na2Se, and Na2S/Na2Se) due to its smallest recorded interface deformation, similar electronegativity, and lattice constant. The experimental evidence confirms that the metal sulfide/metal selenide (SnS/SnSe2) hierarchical anode exhibits outstanding rate performance, where the normalized capacity at 10 A g-1 compared to 0.1 A g-1 is 45.6%.

In this study, a NaPO3 surface modified O3-type layered NaNi1/3 Fe1/3 Mn1/3 O2 cathode is synthesized, with improved high-voltage stability through protecting layer against acid attack, which is achieved by a solid-gas reaction between the cathode particles and gaseous P2 O5 . The NaPO3 nanolayer on the surface effectively stabilizes the crystal structure by inhibiting surface parasitic reactions and increasing the observed average voltage. Superior cyclic stability is exhibited by the surface-modified cathode (80.1% vs 63.6%) after 150 cycles at 1 C in the wide voltage range of 2.0 V-4.2 V (vs Na+ /Na). Moreover, benefiting from the inherent ionic conduction of NaPO3 , the surface-modified cathode presents excellent rate capability (103 mAh g-1  vs 60 mAh g-1 ) at 10 C.

        "abstract": "Heteroatom incorporation can effectively suppress the phase transition of layered sodium-ion battery cathode, but heteroatom behaviors during operating conditions are not completely understood at the atomic scale. Here, density functional theory calculations are combined with experiments to explore the mitigation behavior of Mg dopant and its mechanisms under operating conditions in P2-Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2. The void formed by Na extraction will pump some Mg dopants into Na layers from TM layers, and the collective diffusion of more than one Mg ion most likely occurs when the Mg content is relatively high in the TM layer, finally aggregating to form Mg-enrich regions (i.e., Mg segregation) apart from Ni vacancies. The void-pump-effect-induced Mg segregation effectively suppresses the P2-O2 phase transition owing to the stronger Mg-O electrostatic attraction that enhances the integrate of two adjacent oxygen layers and prevents the crack growth by mitigating the lattice volume variation under high-voltage cycling. Our work provides a fundamental understanding of heteroatom mitigation behavior in layered cathodes at the atomic level for next-generation energy storage technologies.",

Meanwhile, the O redox chemistry and subsequent structural evolution remain ambiguous so far. Here, we deliberate on the O redox mechanism in Na‐storage transition metal oxides.

        "abstract": "P2‐type layered oxide material Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 is a competitive candidate for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, it suffers from the strong P2–O2 phase transition during charging to the high voltage regime, rendering drastic volume variations and poor cycling performance. Here, a Quasi‐zero strain P2‐Na0.75Li0.15Mg0.05Ni0.1Mn0.7O2 cathode is synthesized, which reflects the vanishing P2–O2 transition with a volume change as low as 0.49%, thus resulting in the material an excellent cycling performance (83.9% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 5 C). The low‐volume strain can be attributed to two aspects: (1) the Mg2+ riveted in the Na layer can act as a “pillar” to stabilize the crystal structure under the condition of sodium removal, thus restricting the structural changes under high voltage. (2) The entry of Li+ into the transition metal (TM) layer can mitigate the electron localization in the highly desodiation state and can effectively immobilize the coordination oxygen atoms, thus suppressing the slip of P2–O2 transition. This study not only provides a new insight of Li and Mg synergetic substitution effect on the structural stability of P2‐type cathode, but also an efficient avenue for developing cathode materials of SIBs with ultralow bulk strain.",

        "abstract": "Prussian blue attracts the attention of many researchers as a promising candidate for use in sodium-ion battery cathodes due to its open frameworks and high working potential. However, the interstitial water in its crystal structure and its poor electronic conductivity limits its performance in practical sodium-ion batteries. Here, acid-assisted ball milling synthesis was employed as a versatile method for the production of surface-modified Prussian blue. With (CH3COO)2Fe being used as the raw material, the Prussian blue produced using ball milling synthesis was modified by the carboxyl functional group on its surface, which resulted in lower interstitial water content and enhanced electrochemical cycling performance. In addition, ball milling synthesis provided the as-prepared Prussian blue with a large surface area, improving its electrochemical rate performance. When used as the cathode of sodium-ion batteries, as-prepared Prussian blue delivered a specific capacity of 145.3 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C and 113.7 mAh g−1 at 1 C, maintaining 54.5% of the initial capacity after 1000 cycles at 1 C (1 C = 170 mA g−1). Furthermore, a solid-state sodium-ion battery was mounted, with as-prepared Prussian blue being employed as the cathode and Na metal as the anode, which delivered a high specific capacity of 128.7 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C.

However, they suffer from rapid capacity fading and complicated phase transformations. In this study, we modulate the crystal structure and optimize the electrochemical performances of Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.5O2 by Al doping for Mn or Fe, respectively, and the roles of Al in the enhancement of the rate capability and cycling performance are unraveled. (1) The substitution of Al for Mn or Fe decreases the lattice parameters a and c but enlarges d spacing and lengthens Na-O bonds, which enhances Na+ diffusion and rate capability especially for Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.47Al0.03O2. (2) Al doping reduces the thickness of TMO2 and strengthens TM-O/O-O bonding. This enhances the layered structure stability and the capacity retention. (3) Al doping mitigates Mn3+ and Jahn-Teller distortion, mitigating the irreversible phase transition. (4) Al doping also alleviates the lattice volume variation and the structure strain. This further improves the stability of the layered structure and the cycling performances particularly in the case of Al doping for Fe. The in-depth insights into the roles of Al substitution might be also useful for designing high-performance cathode materials for SIBs through appropriate lattice doping.",

In this work, copper substitution is used to suppress the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn3+ and affect the corresponding lattice structure. The water sensitivity and charge compensation mechanism were carefully investigated. Results demonstrate that water sensitivity of the electrode is related to the order of Na+/vacancy in the Na interlayers since water molecules are more easily inserted into the charged state electrodes, but the tendency for the uptake water does not increase with Na+ extraction. Furthermore, Mn2+ forms on the surface of electrodes in the initial discharge process, and the redox reaction in the bulk are predominantly between Mn3+ and Mn4+. Cu-substituted in TM layer affects the arrangement of Na+/vacancy and suppresses the Mn2+ formation on the Na0.7Mn0.9Cu0.1O2 electrode that results in superior air stability and better storage properties.",

It is found that when the Na content is 0.8, the highest energy efficiency of 95.4% after activation is achieved (2.5-4.0 V, 50 mA g-1, the 50th cycle), in addition to a satisfactory capacity retention (about 0.056% decay per cycle). The further characterizations reveal that Na0.8Cu0.18Fe0.3Mn0.52O2 owns a gentle O3-P3 phase transition process and does not undergo O3 phase lattice parameter evolution. The key point lies in the attainability of the O3/P3 composite of the material.

Therefore, development of high-voltage O3-type cathodes remains challenging because it is difficult to raise the phase-transition voltage by reasonable structure modulation. A new example of O3-type sodium insertion materials is presented for use in NIBs. The designed O3-type Na0.7 Ni0.35 Sn0.65 O2 material displays a highest redox potential of 3.7 V (vs. Na+ /Na) among the reported O3-type materials based on the Ni2+ /Ni3+ couple, by virtue of its increased Ni-O bond ionicity through reduced orbital overlap between transition metals and oxygen within the MO2 slabs.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) can develop cost-effective and safe energy storage technology for substantial energy storage demands. In this work, we have developed manganese oxide (α-MnO2) nanorods for SIB applications. The crystal structure, which is crucial for high-performance energy storage, is examined systematically for the metal oxide cathode. The intercalation of sodium into the α-MnO2 matrix was studied using the theoretical density functional theory (DFT) studies. The DFT studies predict Na ions’ facile diffusion kinetics through the MnO2 lattice with an attractively low diffusion barrier (0.21 eV). When employed as a cathode material for SIBs, MnO2 showed a moderate capacity (109 mAh·g–1 at C/20 current rate) and superior life cyclability (58.6% after 800 cycles) in NaPF6/EC+DMC (5% FEC) electrolyte. It shows a much higher capacity of 181 mAh·g–1 (C/20 current rate) in NaClO4/PC (5% FEC) electrolyte, though it suffers fast capacity fading (11.5% after 800 cycles). Our findings show that high crystallinity and hierarchical nanorod morphology of the MnO2 are responsible for better cycling performance in conjunction with fast and sustained charge-discharge behaviors.",

        "abstract": "Layered manganese-based cathode materials are of great interest due to their high specific capacities for sodium ion batteries. However, the Jahn-Teller effect and the inevitable phase transition are detrimental for achieving considerable cycling stability and rate capability. Herein, a P2-type manganese oxide nanoplate cathode material modified by Mo-substitution with oriented stacking structure and exposed {010} active facets is reported. The manganese oxide nanoplate cathode yields remarkable capacity retention of 87.8% after 1200 cycles at 10C (2000 mA g-1). The specific power density is estimated as high as 530 W Kg-1 with a specific discharge capacity 143.9 mA h g-1 at 1C and 89.6% capacity retention up to 100 cycles. The superior electrochemical performances can be attributed to the efficient chemical modification and the unique structural features of the present manganese oxide nanoplate. Mo-modification can endow manganese oxide cathode with enlarged lattice space and average oxidation state and thus favorable Na+ diffusion to inhibit the Jahn-Teller effect and improve the structure stability, thereby achieving an extremely long cycling life. Multilayer oriented stacking nanoplate structure with exposed {010} active facets is also beneficial for providing more surface active sites and shortening the Na+ diffusion path, leading to better rate capability.",

        "abstract": "The emerging sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are one of the most promising candidates expected to complement lithium‐ion batteries and diversify the battery market. However, the exploitation of cathode materials with high‐rate performance and long‐cycle stability for SIBs has remained one of the major challenges. To this end, an efficient approach to enhance rate and cycling performance by introducing an ordered bicontinuous porous structure into cathode materials of SIBs is demonstrated. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are selected because they are recognized as a type of most promising SIB cathode materials. Thanks to the presence of 3D continuous channels enabling fast Na+ ions diffusion as well as the intrinsic mechanical stability of bicontinuous architecture, the resultant PBAs exhibit excellent rate capability (80 mAh g−1 at 2.5 A g−1) and ultralong cycling life (>3000 circulations at 0.5 A g−1), reaching the top performance of the reported PBA‐based cathode materials. This study opens a new avenue for boosting sluggish ion diffusion kinetics in electrodes of rechargeable batteries and also provides a new paradigm for solving the dilemma that electrodes’ failure due to high‐stress concentration upon ion storage.",

        "abstract": "Cation migration often occurs in layered oxide cathodes of lithium-ion batteries due to the similar ion radius of Li and transition metals (TMs). Although Na and TM show a big difference of ion radius, TMs in layered cathodes of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) can still migrate to Na layer, leading to serious electrochemical degeneration. To elucidate the origin of TM migration in layered SIB cathodes, we choose NaCrO2, a typical layered cathode suffering from serious TM migration, as a model material and find that the TM migration is derived from the random desodiation and subsequent formation of Na-free layer at high charge potential. A Ru/Ti co-doping strategy is developed to address the issue, where the doped active Ru is first oxidized to create a selective desodiation and the doped inactive Ti can function as a pillar to avoid complete desodiation in Ru-contained TM layers, leading to the suppression of the Na-free layer formation and subsequent enhanced electrochemical performance.",

        "abstract": "As a promising cathode material of sodium-ion battery, P2-type Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 (NNMO) possesses a theoretically high capacity and working voltage to realize high energy storage density. However, it still suffers from poor cycling stability mainly incurred by the undesirable P2-O2 phase transition. Herein, the electrochemically active Fe3+ ions are introduced into the lattice of NNMO, forming Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3- xFe xO2 ( x = 0, 1/24, 1/12, 1/8, 1/6) to effectively stabilize the P2-type crystalline structure. In such Fe-substituted materials, both Ni2+/Ni4+ and Fe3+/Fe4+ couples take part in the redox reactions, and the P2-O2 phase transition is well restrained during cycling, as verified by ex situ X-ray diffraction. As a result, the optimized Na2/3Ni1/3Mn7/12Fe1/12O2 (1/12-NNMF) has a long-term cycling stability with the fading rate of 0.05% per cycle over 300 cycles at 5 C. Furthermore, the 1/12-NNMF delivers excellent rate capabilities (65 mA h g-1 at 25 C) and superior low-temperature performance (the capacity retention of 94% at -25 °C after 80 cycles) owing to the enhanced Na diffusion upon Fe doping, which is deduced by the studies of electrode kinetics. More significantly, the 1/12-NNMF also displays remarkable sodium-ion full-cell properties when merged with an LS-Sb@G anode, thus implying the possibility of their practical application.",

        "abstract": "P2 layered oxides have attracted more and more attention as cathode materials of high-power sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). During the charging process, the release of sodium ions leads to layer slip, which leads to the transformation of P2 phase into O2 phase, resulting in a sharp decline in capacity. However, many cathode materials do not undergo P2 -O2 transition during charging and discharging, but form a \"Z\" phase. It is proved that the iron-containing compound Na0.67 Ni0.1 Mn0.8 Fe0.1 O2 formed the \"Z\" phase of the symbiotic structure of the P phase and O phase during high-voltage charging through ex-XRD and HAADF-STEM. During the charging process, the cathode material undergoes a structural change of P2 -OP4 -O2 . With the increase of charging voltage, the O-type superposition mode increases to form an ordered OP4 phase, and the P2 -type superposition mode disappears after further charging to form a pure O2 phase. 57 Fe-Mössbauer spectroscopy revealed that no migration of Fe ions is detected. The O-Ni-O-Mn-Fe-O bond formed in the transition metal MO6 (M = Ni, Mn, Fe) octahedron can inhibit the elongation of the Mn-O bond and improve the electrochemical activity so that P2-Na0.67 Ni0.1 Mn0.8 Fe0.1 O2 has an excellent capacity of 172.4 mAh g-1 and a coulombic efficiency close to 99% at 0.1C.",

Herein, nanocubic porous Nax FeFe(CN)6 coated with polydopamine (PDA) as a coupling layer to improve its electrochemical performance is reported, inspired by the excellent adhesive property of PDA. As a cathode for sodium-ion batteries, the Nax FeFe(CN)6 electrode coupled with PDA delivers a reversible capacity of 93.8 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 0.2 A g-1 , and a discharge capacity of 72.6 mA h g-1 at 5.0 A g-1 . The sodium storage mechanism of this Nax FeFe(CN)6 coupled with PDA is revealed via in situ Raman spectroscopy. The first-principles computational results indicate that FeII sites in PB prefer to couple with the robust PDA layer to stabilize the PB structure. Moreover, the sodium-ion migration in the PB structure is enhanced after coating with PDA, thus improving the sodium storage properties. Both experiments and computational simulations present guidelines for the rational design of nanomaterials as electrodes for energy storage devices.",

However, fatal issues in several respects such as poor air stability, irreversible complex multiphase evolution, inferior cycling lifespan, and poor industrial feasibility are restricting their commercialization development. Here, a stable Co-free O3-type NaNi0.4Cu0.05Mg0.05Mn0.4Ti0.1O2 cathode material with large-scale production could solve these problems for practical SIBs. Owing to the synergetic contribution of the multielement chemical substitution strategy, this novel cathode not only shows excellent air stability and thermal stability as well as a simple phase-transition process but also delivers outstanding battery performance in half-cell and full-cell systems. Meanwhile, various advanced characterization techniques are utilized to accurately decipher the crystalline formation process, atomic arrangement, structural evolution, and inherent effect mechanisms. Surprisingly, apart from restraining the unfavorable multiphase transformation and enhancing air stability, the accurate multielement chemical substitution engineering also shows a pinning effect to alleviate the lattice strains for the high structural reversibility and enlarges the interlayer spacing reasonably to enhance Na+ diffusion, resulting in excellent comprehensive performance. Overall, this study explores the fundamental scientific understandings of multielement chemical substitution strategy and opens up a new field for increasing the practicality to commercialization.",

Heterometallic fluorinated β-diketonates NaM(hfac)3 (M = Mn (1), Fe (2), Co (3), and Ni (4); hfac = hexafluoroacetylacetonate) have been obtained on a large scale, in high yield using a one-step reaction that employs commercially available reagents. The complexes are stable in open air and highly volatile. The mass spectrometric investigation indicates the existence of heterometallic molecules in the gas phase. The presence of heterometallic species in solutions of several solvents has been unambiguously confirmed. Heterometallic precursors were shown to exhibit clean, low-temperature decomposition in argon atmosphere that results in phase-pure perovskite fluorides NaMF3, the prospective cathode materials for sodium ion batteries.",

This electrolyte was used in a novel aqueous sodium-ion battery (ASIB) system, which was assembled by using a zinc anode and Na4Mn9O18 cathode. The nanorod-like Na4Mn9O18 was synthesized by a hydrothermal soft chemical reaction. The structural and morphological measurement confirmed that the highly crystalline Na4Mn9O18 nanorods are uniformly distributed. Electrochemical tests of Na4Mn9O18//Zn gel polymer battery demonstrated its high cycle stability along with a good rate of performance. The battery delivers an initial discharge capacity of 96 mAh g−1, and 64 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at a high cycling rate of 1 C.

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted widespread attention for large‐scale energy storage, but one major drawback, i.e., the limited capacity of cathode materials, impedes their practical applications. Oxygen redox reactions in layered oxide cathodes are proven to contribute additionally high specific capacity, while such cathodes often suffer from irreversible structural transitions, causing serious capacity fading and voltage decay upon cycling, and the formation process of the oxidized oxygen species remains elusive. Herein, a series of Al‐doped P2‐type Na0.6Ni0.3Mn0.7O2 cathode materials for SIBs are reported and the corresponding charge compensation mechanisms are investigated qualitatively and quantitatively. The combined analyses reveal that Al doping boosts the reversible oxygen redox reactions through the reductive coupling reactions between orphaned O 2p states in NaOAl local configurations and Ni4+ ions, as directly evidenced by X‐ray absorption fine structure results. Additionally, Al doping also induces an increased interlayer spacing and inhibits the unfavorable P2 to O2 phase transition upon desodiation/sodiation, which is common in P2‐type Mn‐based cathode materials, leading to the great improvement in capacity retention and rate capability. This work provides deeper insights into the development of structurally stable and high‐capacity layered cathode materials for SIBs with anion–cation synergetic contributions.",

        "abstract": "The development of Na-ion full cells (NIFCs) suffers from the issue that the solid electrolyte interphase formation on the carbon anode consumes the limited sodium from cathode and thus incurs the decreased energy density and poor cyclic stability. To address these issues, we herein report that Na2O2 could be used as a sacrificial Na source through spraying its slurry on the surface of cathode, and investigate its stability as well as electrochemical behavior toward NIFCs. The results show that Na2O2 has good chemical and storage stability under a dry atmosphere and has no negative effect on the electrochemical performance of the cathode. Compared with the pristine cathode, the Na2O2-decorated cathode exhibits higher discharge capacity, superior capacity retention, and rate capability in a full cell with a carbon anode. Our cathode Na compensation strategy provides an effective avenue to make up for the irreversible Na+ loss cause by the formation of solid electrolyte interphase on the anode, thereby promoting the electrochemical performance and energy density of NIFCs toward the large-scale application.",

Two typical classes of materials including transition metal oxides and polyanion compounds have been under intensive investigation as cathodes for SIBs; however, they are still limited to poor stability or low capacity of the state-of-art. Herein, we report a low cost carbon-coated Na2FeSiO4 with simultaneous high capacity and good stability, owing to the highly pure Na-rich triclinic phase and the carbon-incorporated three-dimensional network morphology. The present carbon-coated Na2FeSiO4 demonstrates the highest reversible capacity of 181.0 mAh g-1 to date with multielectron redox reaction that occurred among various polyanion-based SIBs cathodes, which achieves a close-to-100% initial Coulombic efficiency and a stable cycling with 88% capacity retention up to 100 cycles. In addition, such an electrode shows excellent stability either charged at a high voltage of 4.5 V or heated up to 800 °C.

The reaction mechanism of metal cations in HE-K-PBA are revealed by synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and in situ Raman spectra. We also investigate the entropy stabilization mechanism via finite element simulation, demonstrating that HE-K-PBA with small von Mises stress and weak structure strain can significantly mitigate the structural distortion. Benefit from the stable structure and everlasting K+ (de)intercalation, the HE-K-PBA delivers high output voltage (3.46 V), good reversible capacity (120.5 mAh g-1 at 0.01 A g-1), and capacity retention of 90.4% after 1700 cycles at 1.0 A g-1.

        "abstract": "Layered transition metal oxides, in particular P2-type ones, are considered as promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries on account of their high specific capacity and rate capability. Nevertheless, conventional layered compounds involve detrimental phase transformation throughout repeated cycles, which results in electrochemical performance degradation. Therefore, finding structurally stable layered compounds, featuring minimal phase transition has been a key theme of the sodium-ion battery research. Here lithium substituted Fe/Mn-based P2/O3 layered oxide-Na0.67 Li0.2 Fe0.2 Mn0.6 O2 -that overcomes the inherited structural instability, is reported. In situ synchrotron-based diffraction measurements and DFT calculations are utilized, in order to identify the association between P2/O3 biphasic structure and electrochemical performances. The lithium honeycomb ordering within the P2/O3 biphasic layered compound effectively constrains the undesirable phase transitions; more specifically, both P2-Z phase transition and Jahn-Teller distortion are suppressed throughout wide potential range of 1.5-4.5 V. The DFT calculation further discovers that the presence of honeycomb ordering is crucial for achieving the structural stability by forming Na-vac-Li and Na-Li-Na pairing at highly charged state. The results highlight that the synergetic effect of P2/O3 biphasic structure and lithium substitution can provide an effective strategy toward achieving electrochemically stable layered cathode material for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "P-type layered oxide is a promising cathode candidate for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), but faces the challenge of simultaneously realizing high rate capability and long cycle life. Herein, Co-substituted Nax MnO2 nanosheets with tunable P2/P3 biphase structures are synthesized by a novel dealloying-annealing strategy. The optimized P2/P3-Na0.67 Mn0.64 Co0.30 Al0.06 O2 cathode delivers an excellent rate capability of 83 mA h g-1 at a high current density of 1700 mA g-1 (10 C), and an outstanding cycling stability over 500 cycles at 1000 mA g-1 . This excellent performance is attributed to the unique P2/P3 biphases with stable crystal structures and fast Na+ diffusion between open prismatic Na sites. Moreover, operando X-ray diffraction is applied to explore the structural evolution of Na0.67 Mn0.64 Co0.30 Al0.06 O2 during the Na+ extraction/insertion processes, and the P2-P2' phase transition is effectively suppressed. Operando Raman technique is utilized to explore the structural superiority of P2/P3 biphase cathode compared with pure P2 or P3 phase. This work highlights precisely tailoring the phase composition as an effective strategy to design advanced cathode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Composite electrolytes (CE) combining a ceramic filler and a polymer matrix is an effective way to enhance battery safety. But the increased ceramic filler mass fraction decreases the flexibility, which increases the interfacial resistance. To alleviate interfacial resistance further, a gradient composite electrolyte (GCE) using a Sc, Ge-doped Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP) as the ceramic filler and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) as the polymer matrix is proposed. The outer layer contains a low concentration of ceramic filler to improve interfacial contact, and the central layer contains a high concentration of ceramic filler to inhibit dendrite penetration. This GCE possesses an enhanced conductivity (4.0 × 10-5 S cm-1 at 30 °C) and a reduced interfacial resistance. Furthermore, the safety was boosted using Sn4P3@CNT/C as the high-capacity anode active material and Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) as the cathode active material.

        "abstract": "The conventional P2-type cathode material Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 suffers from an irreversible P2–O2 phase transition and serious capacity fading during cycling. Here, we successfully carry out magnesium and calcium ion doping into the transition-metal layers (TM layers) and the alkali-metal layers (AM layers), respectively, of Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2. Both Mg and Ca doping can reduce O-type stacking in the high-voltage region, leading to enhanced cycling endurance, however, this is associated with a decrease in capacity. The results of density functional theory (DFT) studies reveal that the introduction of Mg2+ and Ca2+ make high-voltage reactions (oxygen redox and Ni4+/Ni3+ redox reactions) less accessible. Thanks to the synergetic effect of co-doping with Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions, the adverse effects on high-voltage reactions involving Ni–O bonding are limited, and the structural stability is further enhanced. The finally obtained P2-type Na0.62Ca0.025Ni0.28Mg0.05Mn0.67O2 exhibits a satisfactory initial energy density of 468.2 W h kg−1 and good capacity retention of 83% after 100 cycles at 50 mA g−1 within the voltage range of 2.2–4.35 V.

In this study, we put forward substituting an inert phosphate with a redox-active silicate to improve the energy density and intrinsic electroconductivity of polyanion-type phosphate materials, thus enabling an advance in sodium-ion battery cathodes. As a proof of concept, some of the phosphate of Na3V2(PO4)3 was replaced by silicate to fabricate Na3V2(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1, which exhibited a higher average discharge voltage of 3.36 V and a higher capacity of 115.8 mA h g-1 than pristine Na3V2(PO4)3 (3.31 V, 109.6 mA h g-1) at 0.5 C, therefore improving the energy density. Moreover, the introduced silicate enhanced the intrinsic electroconductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3 materials, as confirmed by both theoretical simulation and electrochemical measurements. After pairing with a commercial hard carbon anode, the optimized Na3V2(PO4)2.9(SiO4)0.1 cathode enabled a stable-cycling full cell with 90.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 5 C and a remarkable average coulombic efficiency of 99.88%.",

The reaction results in just a minor lattice contraction, and a broad intervalence charge-transfer band emerges, indicative of charge mobility.

Significantly, the anion insertion behavior of Fe2(dobpdc) enabled its use in the construction of a dual-ion battery prototype incorporating a sodium anode.

In this work, we have made the heterostructure by taking half-metallic ferromagnetic 2D transition metal oxide CoO2 and semiconducting MnO2 monolayers and demonstrated its potential application as a cathode material in lithium and sodium-ion batteries by performing first-principles calculations using density functional theory approach. We have systematically studied the electronic structure and stability of the MnO2/CoO2 heterostructure. We have carefully examined the adsorption and diffusion behavior of metal ions (lithium and sodium). Our structure has offered a maximum adsorption energy of −3.84 eV, which is greater than the adsorption energy of individual monolayers. We found that the lowest diffusion barrier is 0.4 eV for lithium ion and 0.32 eV for sodium ion. Also, our system has shown a maximum open circuit voltage of 2.18 V for lithium ion battery and 0.32 V for Na-ion battery. The specific capacity is found to be 584 mAh g−1 for lithium ion and 529 mAh g−1 for sodium ion battery.

However, the amount of reversibly extractable Na+ ions is restricted by half, which results in relatively low energy density for practical NIB cathodes. Herein, we describe aliovalent-doped O3–Na0.9[Cr0.9Sn0.1]O2 (NCSnO) and O3–Na0.8[Cr0.9Sb0.1]O2 (NCSbO), both of which show high-voltage characteristics that translate to an increase in energy density. In contrast to NaCrO2, NCSnO and NCSbO can be reversibly charged to 3.80 and 3.95 V, respectively, delivering 0.5 Na+ along with Cr3+/4+ redox alone. The reversible chargeability to Na0.4[Cr0.9Sn0.1]O2 and Na0.3[Cr0.9Sb0.1]O2 is not associated with the suppression of Cr6+ formation. Both compounds show concentrations of Cr6+ that are higher than that of Na0.3CrO2, with an absence of O3′ phases. This implies that aliovalent-doping contributes to a suppression of the Cr6+ migration into tetrahedral sites in the interslab space, which reduces the possibility of irreversible comproportionation. NCSnO and NCSbO deliver capacities comparable to that of NaCrO2, but show a higher average discharge voltage (2.94 V for NaCrO2; 3.14 V for NCSnO; 3.21 V for NCSbO), which leads to a noticeable increase in energy densities.

The cathode displays a satisfactory working voltage of 3.6 V and excellent cyclic stability over 100 cycles at 1 C rate without obvious capacity fading. The results of ex-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) demonstrate that P3-type structure is well retained even charged to 4.4 V. Furthermore, the structural characterization by XRD Rietveld refinement, scanning electron microscope and electrochemical testing certify that the cathode maintains its structure commendably even when soaked in water for 12 h. In particular, the P3- Na2/3Ni1/4Mg1/12Mn2/3O2//hard carbon assembled for full battery exhibits a desired competitive high voltage of 3.45 V and an attractive energy density up to 412.2 Wh kg-1 based on the cathode. The comprehensive results achieved by special designing strategy provide a guidance toward the exploring of stable cathode in the application of the SIBs as modern energy-storage devices.",

        "abstract": "Sodium superionic conductor (NASICON)-Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 (NVP) is attractive cathode for sodium-ion battery, which is still confronted with limited rate performance due to its lower electronic conductivity. In this paper chemical strategy is adopted to partially replace V 3+ of NVP framework by low valence Mn 2+ and high valence Mo 6+ substitution. The crystal structure, sodium-ion diffusion coefficient and electrochemical performance of Mn-Mo-doped [Na 3.94 V 0.98 Mo 0.02 Mn(PO 4 ) 3 @C] cathode were investigated. X-ray diffraction confirmed the NASICON-type structure and XPS analysis confirmed the oxidation state of Mn and Mo in doped NVP cathode. The Na ion diffusion processes were inferred from Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurement, which clearly show rapid Na-ion diffusion in NASICON-type cathode materials. The Mn-Mo-substituted NVP shows smoother charge-discharge profiles, improved rate performance (64.80 mAh/g at 1C rate), better energy density (308.61 mWh/g) and superior Na-ion kinetics than that of unsubstituted NVP@C cathode. Their enhanced performance is attributed to large interstitial volume mainly created by high valence Mo 6+ and enhanced capacity is attributed to the low valence Mn 2+ doping. These results demonstrate that Mn-Mo-doped NVP cathode is strongly promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The cost-effective and abundant availability of sodium offers an opportunity for rechargeable Na-ion batteries as an ideal replacement for rechargeable Li-ion batteries. However, the larger size and strong Na+-Na+ interaction create multidimensional phase instability and transformation problems, especially in layer-structured NaxMO2 (Mn, Co, Fe, and Ni) that inhibit the direct transformation of rechargeable Li-ion battery technology to Na-ion batteries. However, framework structures offer superior structural stability due to the interconnection of polyanions or polyhedra forming cationic octahedra. Sodium superionic conductor (NASICON)-type structures are well known for their superior Na+ ion transport and are identified as intercalative hosts as electrodes for rechargeable Na-ion batteries. Here, we report the synthesis of Na3Fe2PO4(SO4)2 in a NASICON framework structure and its investigation as a cathode in a Na/Na3Fe2PO4(SO4)2 cell working on the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple. The cell provides a single-phase reaction having a capacity approaching 70 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C after 50 cycles in the voltage range of 2 to 4.2 V, with a columbic efficiency approaching 100%.

        "abstract": "As promising cathodes for Na-ion batteries (NIBs), layered transition metal (TM) oxides have attracted intense research activities due to high specific capacities, especially benefitting from the boosted capacity triggered by oxygen-related anionic redox reactions (ARRs). However, on the aspect of ARRs activity, the difference between typically O3 and P2-type structures has not been clearly clarified with the in-depth exploration. Herein, composed with similar composition, ARRs induced oxygen behaviors within O3-Na0.6Li0.2Fe0.4Ru0.4O2 and P2-Na0.6Li0.35Fe0.1Ru0.55O2 are systematically investigated by varying ex/in-situ spectroscopic characterizations. Conducted with lower charging cut-off voltage (4.0 V), P2-type cathode will be easier to trigger the reversible oxygen behaviors and delivers a larger capacity, better rate performance as well as stable cyclability, in contrast to the O3-type cathode. Moreover, within O3-type structure, increasing charging potential (beyond 4.3 V) would induce additional anionic oxidation capacity, but inevitably lead to the irreversible evolution of gaseous O2 and superoxo. With the unique feature, this work provides a promising strategy design for fabricating cathodes with optimal microstructural arrangement, which could further push forward the changes in macro/nano structure and even the ideal performance.",

        "abstract": "Polyanionic Na3V2(PO4)2F3 with a NASICON‐type structure is heralded as a promising cathode material for sodium‐ion batteries due to its fast ionic conduction, high working voltage, and favorable structural stability. However, a number of challenging issues remain regarding its rate capability and cycle life, which must be addressed to enable greater application compatibility. Here, a facile and effective approach that can be used to overcome these disadvantages by introducing an aqueous carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binder is reported. The resulting conductive network serves to accelerate the diffusion of Na+ ions across the interface as well as in the bulk. The strong binding force of the CMC and stable solid permeable interface protect the electrode from degradation, leading to an excellent capacity of 75 mA h g−1 at an ultrahigh rate of 70 C (1 C = 128 mA g−1) and a long lifespan of 3500 cycles at 30 C while sustaining 79% of the initial capacity value. A full cell based on this electrode material delivers an impressive energy density as high as 216 W h kg−1, indicating the potential for application of this straightforward and cost‐effective route for the future development of advanced battery technologies.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion battery has been considered as one of the most promising power sources for large‐scale energy storage systems due to its similar electrochemistry to the lithium‐ion battery and the crust abundance of Na resources. Essentially, developing low‐cost electrode materials along with a facile and economical synthesis procedure is critically important to promote the commercialization of sodium‐ion batteries. However, applicable cathode materials capable of being massively produced are still scarcely reported to date. Herein, a green and scalable synthesis approach is developed to obtain Na3Fe2(PO4)P2O7 (NFPP)/rGO composite by using FePO4 and Na3PO4 as the resources, during which all the atoms present in the starting materials end up in the product. The prepared Na3Fe2(PO4)P2O7/rGO cathode exhibits an ultralong cycle life (capacity retention of 72.4% after 8000 cycles at 20 C) and outstanding rate capability (42.4 mAh g−1 at 100 C). In particular, the NFPP/rGO‐HC full battery assembled by the Na3Fe2(PO4)P2O7/rGO cathode and hard carbon anode demonstrates an energy density of 192 Wh kg−1 and superior cycling performance (capacity retention of 85.2% after 500 cycles).

        "abstract": "All-solid-state sodium ion batteries (ASIBs) based on sulfide electrolytes are considered a promising candidate for large-scale energy storage. However, the limited cycle life of ASIBs largely restricts their practical application. Cycling-stable ASIBs can be achieved only if the designed cathode can simultaneously address challenges including insufficient interfacial contact, electrochemical and chemical instability between the electrode and electrolyte, and strain/stress during operation , rather than just addressing one or part of these challenges. Chevrel phase Mo6S8 has inherent high electronic conductivity and small volume change during sodiation/desodiation, and is chemically and electrochemically stable with the sulfide electrolyte, and therefore the only challenge of using Mo6S8 as the cathode for ASIBs is the insufficient contact between Mo6S8 and the solid electrolyte (SE). Herein, a thin layer of SE is coated on Mo6S8 using a solution method to achieve an intimate contact between Mo6S8 and the SE. Such a SE-coated Mo6S8 cathode enabled an ASIB with a high cycling performance (500 cycles), even much better than that of the liquid-electrolyte batteries with the Mo6S8 cathode. This work provides valuable insights for developing long-cycle life ASIBs.",

The capacity of the cathode combined with that provided by the electrolyte redox reaction thus increases overall charge storage.

        "abstract": "While development of a sodium-ion battery (SIB) cathode has been approached by various routes, research on compatible anodes for advanced SIB systems has not been sufficiently addressed. The anode materials based on titanium oxide typically show low electrical performances in SIB systems primarily due to their low electrical/ionic conductivity. Thus, in this work, layered titanium oxides were hybridized with covalent organic nanosheets (CONs), which exhibited excellent electrical conductivity, to be used as anodes in SIBs. Moreover, to enlarge the accessible areas for sodium ions, the morphology of the hybrid was formulated in the form of a hollow sphere (HS), leading to the highly enhanced ionic conductivity. This synthesis method was based on the expectation of synergetic effects since titanium oxide provides direct electrostatic sodiation sites that shield organic components and CON supports high electrical and ionic conductivity with polarizable sodiation sites. Therefore, the hybrid shows enhanced and stable electrochemical performances as an anode for up to 2600 charge/discharge cycles compared to the HS without CONs. Furthermore, the best reversible capacities obtained from the hybrid were 426.2 and 108.5 mAh/g at current densities of 100 and 6000 mA/g, which are noteworthy results for the TiO2-based material.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐based dual ion batteries (SDIBs) have garnered significant attention as novel energy storage devices offering the advantages of high‐voltage and low‐cost. Nonetheless, conventional electrolytes exhibit low resistance to oxidation and poor compatibility with electrode materials, resulting in rapid battery failure. In this study, for the first time, a chlorination design of electrolytes for SDIB, is proposed. Using ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) as a representative, chlorine (Cl)‐substituted EMC not only demonstrates increased oxidative stability ascribed to the electron‐withdrawing characteristics of chlorine atom, electrolyte compatibility with both the cathode and anode is also greatly improved by forming Cl‐containing interface layers. Consequently, a discharge capacity of 104.6 mAh g−1 within a voltage range of 3.0–5.0 V is achieved for Na||graphite SDIB that employs a high graphite cathode mass loading of 5.0 mg cm−2, along with almost no capacity decay after 900 cycles. Notably, the Na||graphite SDIB can be revived for an additional 900 cycles through the replacement of a fresh Na anode. As the mass loading of graphite cathode increased to 10 mg cm−2, Na||graphite SDIB is still capable of sustaining over 700 times with ≈100% capacity retention. These results mark the best outcome among reported SDIBs. This study corroborates the effectiveness of chlorination design in developing high‐voltage electrolytes and attaining enduring cycle stability of Na‐based energy storage devices.",

In this study, we synthesized a Na-rich copper hexacyanoferrate(II) Na2 CuFe(CN)6 as a high potential cathode and used NaTi2 (PO4 )3 as a Na-deficient anode to assemble an aqueous sodium ion battery. This battery works very well with a high average discharge voltage of 1.4 V, a specific energy of 48 Wh kg(-1) , and an excellent high-rate cycle stability with approximately 90 % capacity retention over 1000 cycles, achieving a new record in the electrochemical performance of aqueous Na-ion batteries.

        "abstract": "The stable phase transformation during electrochemical progress drives extensive research on vanadium‐based polyanions in sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), especially Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP). And the electron transfer between V3+/4+ redox couple in NVP could be generally achieved, owing to the confined crystal variation during battery service. However, the more favorable V4+/5+ redox couple is still in hard‐to‐access situation due to the high barrier and further brings about the corresponding inefficiency in energy densities. In this work, the multilevel redox in NVP frame (MLNP) alters reaction pathway to undergo homeostatic solid solution process and breaks the high barrier of V4+/5+ at high voltage, taking by progressive transition metal (V, Fe, Ti, and Cr) redox couple. The diversified reaction paths across diffusion barriers could be realized by distinctive release/uptake of inactive Na1 site, confirmed by the calculations of density functional theory. Thereby its volume change is merely 1.73% during the multielectron‐transfer process (≈2.77 electrons). MLNP cathode could achieve an impressive energy density of 440 Wh kg−1, driving the leading development of MLNP among other NASICON structure SIBs. The integration of multiple redox couples with low strain modulates the reaction pathway effectively and will open a new avenue for fabricating high‐performance cathodes in SIBs.",

        "abstract": "A series of alluaudite Na2 Fe3-x Mnx (PO4 )3 microcompounds, which self-assembled from primary nanorods, were prepared successfully through a solvothermal method. As a promising candidate cathode for sodium-ion batteries, it is necessary to obtain a deeper understanding of the relationship between the structure and physicochemical properties of these materials. The local electronic and geometric environments were systematically investigated, for the first time, by using a combination of soft/hard X-ray absorption, IR, and Mössbauer spectroscopy. The results show that the electrochemical performance is not only associated with morphology, but also with the electronic and crystalline structure. With the introduction of manganese into the lattice, the long-range order maintains the isostructural framework and the lattice parameters expand as expected. However, for short-range order, PO4 tetrahedra and MO6 octahedra (M=Fe and Mn) become more severely distorted as a function of Mn concentration. Meanwhile, larger MnO6 octahedra will compress the space of FeO6 octahedra, which will result in stronger core/electron-electron interactions for Fe, as characterized by hard/soft X-ray absorption spectra. These slight changes in the electronic and local structures lead to different electrochemical performances with changes to the manganese content. Moreover, other physicochemical properties, such as magnetic behavior, are also confirmed to be correlated with these different electron interactions and local geometric environments.",

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPOF) is attracting great interest due to its large capacity and high working voltage. However, the poor electronic conductivity limits the electrochemical performance of NVPOF. Herein, we fabricate N/P-dual-doped carbon coated NVPOF microspheres (labeled as NVPOF@P/N/C) via a hydrothermal process followed by heat treatment. This microsphere-structured NVPOF@P/N/C composite has a relatively high tap density of 1.22 g cm-3. TEM and XPS results reveal that the dual-doped carbon layer is tightly coated on the NVPOF surface due to the bridging effect of P and has a good protective effect on NVPOF. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that N/P-dual-doped carbon layer is advantageous to achieve higher electronic conductivity and lower migration activation energy than the undoped and single N- or P-doped carbon layer. As cathode material for sodium-ion battery (SIB), the NVPOF@P/N/C exhibits high capacity (128 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C and 122 mAh g-1 at 2 C) and ultra-long cycle performance (only 0.037% capacity fading rate per cycle in 500 cycles at 2 C).

Even at -20 °C, a high capacity of 175 mAh g -1 (74% of its room temperature capacity) can be maintained at 2 A g -1 . Such electrode retains 90% of its initial capacity after 1000 cycles. As proved, weak ion solvation/desolvation of tetrahydrofuran greatly facilitates fast ion diffusion at SEI/electrolyte interface and homogeneous SEI with well-distributed NaF and organic components ensures fast Na + diffusion through the SEI layer and stable interface.",

A large amount of olive stone waste is yearly produced in the world, and it could be re-used for fine applications other than fuel for heat production. After treatment with sulfuric acid solution and carbonization process, wastes of olive stone are efficiently transformed into optimized carbon electrode material. XRD, XRF and XPS, electron microscopy, and physical gas adsorption are used for the compositional, microstructural, and textural characterization of the carbons. During the synthesis, impurities are removed, C-S links are formed and micropores pores are created. Sulfuric acid acts like S-dopant. The latent pores, or pores closed to nitrogen, can be found using CO2 adsorption, and are very suitable for accommodation for sodium. The results reveal that the reversible capacity is raised from ca. 200 mAh g-1 to ca. 250 mAh g-1 for the carbon obtained through treatment with sulfuric acid.

        "abstract": "Titanates have been widely reported as anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, their wide temperature suitability and cycle life remain fundamental issues that hinder their practical application. Herein, a novel hollow Na2Ti3O7 microsphere (H‐NTO) with a unique chemically bonded NTO/C(N) interface is reported. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the NTO/C(N) interface stabilizes the crystal structure, and the optimized interface enables the H‐NTO anode to stably operate for 80 000 cycles in a conventional ester electrolyte with negligible capacity loss. Optimizing the electrolyte allows the H‐NTO electrode to cycle stably for 200 calendar days without capacity degradation at −40 °C. The excellent cycling stability is attributed to the NTO/C(N) interface and the stable solid electrolyte interphase formed by the highly adaptable electrolyte/electrode interface. Titanate exhibits solvent co‐intercalation behavior in ether‐based electrolytes, and its robust structure ensures that it can adapt to large volume changes at low temperatures. This study provides a unique perspective on the long‐cycle mechanism of titanate anodes and highlights the critical importance of manipulating the interfacial chemistry in SIBs, including the material and electrode/electrolyte interfaces.",

Our density functional theory calculation suggests that this is due to a large Na+ ion diffusion barrier in the innate g-C3N4 nanosheet. Here we strategically apply a facile one-pot heating of a mixture of low-cost urea and asphalt to yield stacked multilayer C/g-C3N4 composites with improved Na-storage capacity (about 2 times higher than that of g-C3N4, up to 254 mAh/g), rate capability and cyclability.

        "abstract": "Lithium‐ion and sodium‐ion batteries (LIBs and SIBs) are crucial in our shift toward sustainable technologies. In this work, the potential of layered boride materials (MoAlB and Mo2AlB2) as novel, high‐performance electrode materials for LIBs and SIBs, is explored. It is discovered that Mo2AlB2 shows a higher specific capacity than MoAlB when used as an electrode material for LIBs, with a specific capacity of 593 mAh g−1 achieved after 500 cycles at 200 mA g−1. It is also found that surface redox reactions are responsible for Li storage in Mo2AlB2, instead of intercalation or conversion. Moreover, the sodium hydroxide treatment of MoAlB leads to a porous morphology and higher specific capacities exceeding that of pristine MoAlB. When tested in SIBs, Mo2AlB2 exhibits a specific capacity of 150 mAh g−1 at 20 mA g−1. These findings suggest that layered borides have potential as electrode materials for both LIBs and SIBs, and highlight the importance of surface redox reactions in Li storage mechanisms.",

However, as an ultimate solution, the use of non-flammable electrolyte is susceptible to the side effects, and its poor compatibility with electrode, causing failure of batteries. Here, we report a non-flammable electrolyte design to achieve high-performance sodium ion battery, which resolves the dilemma via regulating the solvation structure of electrolyte by hydrogen bonds and optimizing the electrode-electrolyte interphase. The reported non-flammable electrolyte allows stable charge-discharge cycling of both sodium vanadium phosphate@hard carbon and Prussian blue@hard carbon full pouch cell for more than 120 cycles with a capacity retention of > 85% and high cycling Coulombic efficiency (99.7%).",

The electrochemical reactivity of NaNi(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(2) is examined in an aprotic sodium cell at room temperature. The NaNi(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(2) electrodes can deliver ca. 105-125 mAh g(-1) at rates of 240-4.8 mA g(-1) in the voltage range of 2.2-3.8 V and show 75% of the initial reversible capacity after 50 charge/discharge cycling tests. In the voltage range of 2.2-4.5 V, a higher reversible capacity of 185 mAh g(-1) is achieved; however, its reversibility is insufficient because of the significant expansion of interslab space by charging to 4.5 V versus sodium. The reversbility is improved by adding fluoroethylene carbonate into the electrolyte solution. The structural transition mechanism of Na(1-x)Ni(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(2) is also examined by an ex situ X-ray diffraction method combined with X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The staking sequence of the [Ni(0.5)Mn(0.5)]O(2) slabs changes progressively as sodium ions are extracted from the crystal lattice. It is observed that the original O3 phase transforms into the O'3, P3, P'3, and P3\" phases during sodium extraction. XAS measurement proves that NaNi(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(2) consists of divalent nickel and tetravalent manganese ions. As sodium ions are extracted from the oxide to form Na(1-x)Ni(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(2), nickel ions are oxidized to the trivalent state, while the manganese ions are electrochemically inactive as the tetravalent state.",

Hence, we have developed a facile process to fabricate powder exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets capable of large-scale production and having highly monolayer-rich structures. This process contains two steps: liquid-phase exfoliation of the edge-rich MoS2 precursor and a freeze-drying procedure. The proposed MoS2 precursors contain rich edge fractions that are easily exfoliated by this method, and the freeze-drying procedure can maintain the unique monolayer-rich structure of MoS2 in the powder phase. The electrochemical evaluations of both lithium- and sodium-ion batteries reveal that the proposed powder exfoliated monolayer-rich MoS2 electrode exhibits remarkable specific capacities and stable cyclic performances. In particular, the monolayer-rich MoS2 nanosheet electrode delivers a superior lithium-storage capacity of ∼1400 mA h g-1. The exfoliated MoS2 nanosheet electrode can withstand over 1000 cycles even at 1 A g-1. The mechanism reveals that these unique MoS2 nanosheets not only have a large surface area but also their inclusive monolayer structures exhibit much higher charge mobility than those of bulk MoS2.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) are an alternative low-cost battery technology for large-scale energy storage application, and the development of high-performance polymer-based electrolytes is crucial for further advancement of low-cost NIBs. Though electrode materials provide significant contribution to the energy density of the battery, the separator plays a vital role in deciding the safety, duration, and performance of batteries. The glass fiber membrane is considered as the most compatible separator for NIBs because of its high ionic conductivity and reasonable performance. However, the leakage and flammability of the liquid electrolytes while using the glass fiber separator can lead to safety issues. Therefore, herein, we present an alternative approach for the first time to replace the glass fiber separator in NIBs using the porous ceramic membrane (PCM). The polymer blend-based PCM is prepared by a simple solution-casting technique and used as the separator in NIBs. The good thermal stability of the PCM up to 400 °C, high ionic conductivity of about 10-3 S cm-1, high electrolyte uptake, and porous nature make it a better choice over the glass fiber membrane. To demonstrate the applicability of PCM in NIBs, the sodium-ion storage property of hard carbon is evaluated using the PCM as the separator at room temperature. The specific capacity of hard carbon using the PCM-based separator is about 270 mA h g-1 at a current density of 30 mA g-1 which is ∼23% higher than the glass fiber separator (208 mA h g-1) at the same current density. The enhancement in specific capacity is due to the compatibility of the PCM with sodium electrodes, low interfacial resistance, high sodium-ion transference number (0.8), and good electrochemical stability (4.9 V) than the glass fiber separator. This study demonstrates a promising alternative separator to the glass fiber membrane, which can lead to the development of a practical and safe NIB.",

        "abstract": "Growing concerns regarding the safety, flammability and hazards posed by Li-ion systems have led to research on alternative rechargeable metal-ion electrochemical storage technologies. Among the most notable of these are Na-ion supercapacitors and batteries, motivated, in part, by the similar electrochemistry of Li and Na ions. However, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) come with their own set of issues, especially the large size of the Na+ ion, its relatively sluggish kinetics and low energy densities. This makes the development of novel materials and appropriate electrode architecture of absolute significance. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted a lot of attention in this regard due to their relative ease of exfoliation, diverse morphologies and architectures with superior electronic properties. Here, we study the electrochemical performance of Mo-based two-dimensional (2D) layered TMDs (e.g. MoS2, MoSe2 and MoTe2), exfoliated in a superacid, for battery and supercapacitor applications. The exfoliated TMD flakes were interfaced with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to be used as composite electrodes. Electron microscopy, elemental mapping and Raman spectra were used to analyse the exfoliated material and confirm the formation of 2D TMD/rGO layer morphology. For supercapacitor applications in aqueous electrolyte, the sulfide-based TMD (MoS2) exhibited the best performance, providing an areal capacitance of 60.25 mF cm−2. For SIB applications, TMD electrodes exhibited significantly higher charge capacities than the neat rGO electrode. The initial desodiation capacities for the composite electrodes are 468.84 mAh g−1 (1687.82 C g−1), 399.10 mAh g−1 (1436.76 C g−1) and 387.36 mAh g−1 (1394.49 C g−1) for MoS2, MoSe2 and MoTe2, respectively. Also, the MoS2 and MoSe2 composite electrodes provided a coulombic efficiency of near 100 % after a few initial cycles.",

Rapid precipitation may lead to a large number of vacancies and a large amount of interstitial water in the material, resulting in poor electrochemical performance in batteries. Hence, sodium citrate is used to compete with [Fe(CN)6]4- to slow down the coordination rates of Ni2+ and Mn2+ ions with ferrous cyanide ions.

In addition, a high rate performance of 77 mA h g-1 is achieved at a current density of 1600 mA g-1. Most noteworthy, the Coulombic efficiency and specific capacity gradually increase in the first few cycles, which can be ascribed to the formation of a passivation layer on the surface of the electrode. Continuous testing in an electrolyte solution of 1 M NaPF6 dissolved in sulfone reveals that the presence of a passivation film is very important for the stability of the electrode.",

To make up for the lost sodium-ion, pre-sodiation treatments have been applied, which are effective ways to mitigate the low initial efficiency. Here, we developed a direct-contact method to achieve the pre-sodiation for cathode and anode electrodes and demonstrated the enhanced coulombic efficiency of the first cycle with improved cyclability and reversible capacity. Moreover, we proved the formation of a thick passivation layer at the cathode-electrolyte interface during the pre-sodiation process; this contributes to the improved cycle stability by preventing the dissolution of the active material and its deposition on the anode surface. The direct-contact method is a simple and cost-effective way to complete pre-sodiation, and this simple process will be widely applicable for practical battery manufacturing.",

        "abstract": "Banana peel pseudographite (BPPG) offers superb dual functionality for sodium ion battery (NIB) and lithium ion battery (LIB) anodes. The materials possess low surface areas (19-217 m(2) g(-1)) and a relatively high electrode packing density (0.75 g cm(-3) vs ∼1 g cm(-3) for graphite). Tested against Na, BPPG delivers a gravimetric (and volumetric) capacity of 355 mAh g(-1) (by active material ∼700 mAh cm(-3), by electrode volume ∼270 mAh cm(-3)) after 10 cycles at 50 mA g(-1). A nearly flat ∼200 mAh g(-1) plateau that is below 0.1 V and a minimal charge/discharge voltage hysteresis make BPPG a direct electrochemical analogue to graphite but with Na. A charge capacity of 221 mAh g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1) is degraded by 7% after 600 cycles, while a capacity of 336 mAh g(-1) at 100 mAg(-1) is degraded by 11% after 300 cycles, in both cases with ∼100% cycling Coulombic efficiency. For LIB applications BPPG offers a gravimetric (volumetric) capacity of 1090 mAh g(-1) (by material ∼2200 mAh cm(-3), by electrode ∼900 mAh cm(-3)) at 50 mA g(-1). The reason that BPPG works so well for both NIBs and LIBs is that it uniquely contains three essential features: (a) dilated intergraphene spacing for Na intercalation at low voltages; (b) highly accessible near-surface nanopores for Li metal filling at low voltages; and (c) substantial defect content in the graphene planes for Li adsorption at higher voltages. The <0.1 V charge storage mechanism is fundamentally different for Na versus for Li. A combination of XRD and XPS demonstrates highly reversible Na intercalation rather than metal underpotential deposition. By contrast, the same analysis proves the presence of metallic Li in the pores, with intercalation being much less pronounced.",

This work describes the synthesis of a series of sodium borate salts, with electrochemical studies revealing that Na[B(hfip)4]⋅DME (hfip=hexafluoroisopropyloxy, OiPrF) and Na[B(pp)2] (pp=perfluorinated pinacolato, O2C2(CF3)4) have excellent electrochemical performance. The [B(pp)2]− anion also exhibits a high tolerance to air and water. Both electrolytes give more stable electrode‐electrolyte interfaces than conventionally used NaPF6, as demonstrated by impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, they give greater cycling stability and comparable capacity to NaPF6 for SIBs, as shown in commercial pouch cells.",

Such a unique structure can efficiently relieve the strain caused by sodiation/desodiation and benefit penetration of the electrolyte and diffusion of Na+ .

The unprecedentedly high diffusion coefficient of Na-ions (3.21 × 10-11 - 1.20 × 10-9 cm2 s-1) and the very low Na-ion diffusion barrier (0.50 eV) lead to very fast electrode kinetics, alike in conventional surface capacitive storage systems.

Moreover, the battery shows a superior stability and high reversibility, with a capacity retention of 90% after 10 000 cycles at 6C rate and a capacity of 79 mAh g-1 is recovered when the current rate is returned to 0.1C. Furthermore, a very thick electrode with active material mass loading of 6 mg cm-2 also presents a reasonable electrochemical performance. These results demonstrate that this is a promising approach to solve the interface problem and would open a new route in designing the next generation solid-state battery.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) has attracted considerable attention in the application of sodium-ion battery (SIB) anodes, but the poor realistic capacity and low rate performance severely hinder their practical application. Herein we report a solvent mechanochemical protocol for the in situ fabrication of the HC-MXene/TiO2 electrode by functionalizing MXene to improve the electrochemical performance of the batteries. MXene (Ti3C2Tx) with abundant oxygen-containing functional groups reacts with HC particles in the ball milling process to form a Ti-O-C covalent cross-linked HC-MXene composite, in which the edge of the MXene nanosheets is in situ oxidized by air to form TiO2 nanorods, forming a regular 1D/2D MXene/TiO2 heterojunction structure. Ti-O-C covalent bonding can protect the heterojunction structures from pulverization and detachment from the current collector during charge/discharge cycles due to sodium-ion intercalation/detachment, thus improving the stability of the electrode structure. Meanwhile, the MXene/TiO2 heterojunction can form a 3D conductive network and provide more active sites. The resulting HC-MXene/TiO2 electrode exhibits superior electrode capacity (660 mAh g-1), making it a promising anode material for SIBs. This simple and efficient method for preparing MXene/TiO2 heterojunction-decorated HC provides a new perspective on the structural design of MXene and carbon material composites for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "WS2 nanoflakes have great potential as electrode materials of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of their unique 2D structure, which facilitates the reversible intercalation and extraction of alkali metal ions. However, a fundamental understanding of the electrochemical lithiation/sodiation dynamics of WS2 nanoflakes especially at the nanoscale level, remains elusive. Here, by combining battery electrochemical measurements, density functional theory calculations, and in situ transmission electron microscopy, the electrochemical-reaction kinetics and mechanism for both lithiation and sodiation of WS2 nanoflakes are investigated at the atomic scale. It is found that compared to LIBs, SIBs exhibit a higher reversible sodium (Na) storage capacity and superior cyclability. For sodiation, the volume change due to ion intercalation is smaller than that in lithiation. Also, sodiated WS2 maintains its layered structure after the intercalation process, and the reduced metal nanoparticles after conversion in sodiation are well-dispersed and aligned forming a pattern similar to the layered structure. Overall, this work shows a direct interconnection between the reaction dynamics of lithiated/sodiated WS2 nanoflakes and their electrochemical performance, which sheds light on the rational optimization and development of advanced WS2 -based electrodes.",

        "abstract": "SnS, is a promising anode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium ion batteries (SIBs), however, undergoes poor cyclic lifespan due to its huge volume changes and bad electroconductivity. Here, a modified CVD method is used to directly grow graphene‐like carbon film on the surface of SnS nanosheet arrays which are supported by Co‐, N‐modified porous carbon fibers (CCF@SnS@G). In the strategy, the SnS nanosheet arrays confined into the integrated carbon matrix containing porous carbon fibers and graphene‐like carbon film, perform a greatly improved electrochemical performance. In situ TEM experiments reveal that the vertical graphene‐like carbon film can not only protect the SnS nanosheet from destruction well and enhance the conductivity, but also transforms SnS nanosheet into ultrafine nanoparticles to promote the electrochemical kinetics. Systematic electrochemical investigations exhibit that the CCF@SnS@G electrode delivers a stable reversible capacity of 529 mAh g−1 at a high current density of 5 A g−1 for LIBs and 541.4 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 for SIBs, suggesting its good potential for anode electrodes.",

        "abstract": "The propensity of sodium anode to form uniform electrodeposit is bound up with the nature of electrode surface and regulation of Na‐ion flux, as well as distribution of electronic field, which is quite crucial for high‐areal‐capacity sodium metal batteries (SMBs). Herein, a novel metallic sodium/sodium–tin alloy foil anode (Na/NaSn) with 3D interpenetrated network and porous structure is prepared through facile alloy reaction. The strong sodiophilic properties of sodium–tin alloy can lower the nucleation energy, resulting in smaller depositing potential and strong adsorption of Na+, while synergistic effect of porous skeleton and additional potential difference (≈0.1 V) between Na and Na–Sn alloy (Na15Sn4) can alleviate volume expansion, redistribute the Na‐ion flux and regulate electronic field, which favors and improves homogeneous Na deposition. The as‐fabricated Na/NaSn electrode can endow excellent plating/stripping reversibility at high areal capacity (over 1600 h for 4 mAh cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 and 2 mAh cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2), fast electrochemical kinetics (500 h under 4 mAh cm−2 at 4 mA cm−2) and superior rate performances. A novel strategy in the design of high‐performance Na anodes for large‐scale energy storage is provided.",

        "abstract": "Engineering novel electrode materials with unique architectures has a significant impact on tuning the structural/electrochemical properties for boosting the performance of secondary battery systems. Herein, starting from well‐organized WS2 nanorods, an ingenious design of a one‐step method is proposed to prepare a bimetallic sulfide composite with a coaxial carbon coating layer, simply enabled by ZIF‐8 introduction. Rich sulfur vacancies and WS2/ZnS heterojunctions can be simultaneously developed, that significantly improve ionic and electronic diffusion kinetics. In addition, a homogeneous carbon protective layer around the surface of the composite guarantees an outstanding structural stability, a reversible capacity of 170.8 mAh g−1 after 5000 cycles at a high rate of 5 A g−1. A great potential in practical application is also exhibited, where a full cell based on the WS2−x/ZnS@C anode and the P2‐Na2/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode can maintain a reversible capacity of 89.4 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 1 A g−1.

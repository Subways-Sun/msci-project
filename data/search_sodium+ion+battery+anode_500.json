        "title": "Biphenylene network as sodium ion battery anode material.",
        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries possess several advantages for large-scale energy storage, such as low cost and enhanced safety. However, graphite or other anode materials are not satisfactory because the large radius of Na+ hinders their embedding and removal in the charge and discharge processes. Recently, a biphenylene network (BPN), a two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotrope, has been synthesized. In this paper, we reveal the potential possibility of BPN as a Na storage material. The theoretical results indicate the advantages of BPN as a sodium battery anode. The maximum specific capacity (413 mA h g-1) is larger than that of the graphite-Li system (372 mA h g-1). With low Na+ diffusion barrier (<0.6 eV) and small volume expansion in the charging process (∼26%), BPN presents superiority to the graphite-Na system. Our findings show new insights into Na storage in BPN and provide guidance for the use of a BPN anode in sodium ion batteries."

        "abstract": "Molybedenum disulfide (MoS2) is regarded as a promising anode material for next-generation sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to its high theoretical capacity. However, its low conductivity, large volume changes, and undesirable phase transformation hinder its practical applications. In this study, we synthesize a hierarchically designed core-shell heterostructure based on nitrogen-doped MoS2/C and silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) (N-MoS2/C@SiOC) via the facile pyrolysis of a suspension of an N-MoS2/polyfurfural precursor in silicone oil. The in situ nitrogen doping in a two-dimensional MoS2 structure with carbon incorporation leads to the enlargement of the interlayer spacing and enhancement of the electronic conductivity and mechanical stability, which allows the facile, highly reversible insertion and extraction of sodium ions upon cycling. Further, the nanoscale SiOC shell with surface capacitive reactivity provides a conductive pathway, preventing unfavorable side reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface and acting as a structure-reinforcing buffer against severe volume expansion issues. As a result, the N-MoS2/C@SiOC composite exhibits high reversible capacity (540.7 mAh g-1), high-capacity retention (>100% after 200 cycles), and excellent rate capability up to 10 A g-1. The simple hierarchical core-shell design strategy developed in this study allows for the fabrication of high-performance metal sulfide anodes as well as other high-capacity anode materials for energy storage applications."

        "abstract": "The increasing cost and limited availability of lithium have prompted the development of high-performance sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) as a potential alternative to lithium-ion batteries. However, it has been a critical challenge to develop high-performance anode materials capable of storing and transporting Na+ efficiently. Amongst the various options, MoS2 has significant advantages including low cost, and a high theoretical capacity of ∼670 mA h g−1. Nevertheless, MoS2 has several issues: its electronic conductivity is low and its structure deteriorates rapidly during charge/discharge cycles, leading to a poor electrochemical performance. Here, a dual-phase MoS2 (DP-MoS2) is synthesized by combining two distinct 1T (trigonal) and 2H (hexagonal) phases to solve these challenges. Compared to the conventional 2H-MoS2 counterpart, the DP-MoS2 phase material presents a highly reversible Na+ intercalation/extraction process aided by expanded interlayer spacing along with much higher electronic conductivity and Na ion affinity. Consequently, the DP-MoS2 electrode delivers a high cyclic stability with a reversible capacity of 300 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 and an excellent rate capability of ∼220 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1. The SIBs assembled with DP-MoS2 and Na3V2(PO4)3 as the negative and positive electrodes, respectively, have a specific capacity of 210 mA h g−1 (based on the mass of DP-MoS2) at 0.5 A g−1. This performance demonstrates that DP-MoS2 has a significant potential in commercial devices. This work offers a new approach to develop metal chalcogenides for electrochemical energy storage applications."

The excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the unique 2D hybrid structures, in which the ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets with expanded interlayers can provide shortened ion diffusion paths and favorable Na+ insertion/extraction space, and the porous N‐doped carbon nanowall arrays on flexible carbon cloth are able to improve the conductivity and maintain the structural integrity. Moreover, the N‐doping‐induced defects also make them favorable for the effective storage of sodium ions, which enables the enhanced capacity and rate performance of MoS2."

        "abstract": "SnS2 materials have attracted broad attention in the field of electrochemical energy storage due to its layered structure with high specific capacity. However, the easy restacking property during charge/discharge cycling would lead to electrode structure instability and serve capacity decrease. In this paper, we report a simple one-step hydrothermal synthesis of SnS2/graphene/SnS2 (SnS2/rGO/SnS2) composite with ultrathin SnS2 nanosheets covalently decorated on both sides of reduced graphene oxide sheets via C‒S bonds. Owing to the graphene sandwiched between two SnS2 sheets, the composite presents an enlarged interlayer spacing of ~8.03 Å for SnS2, which could facilitate the insertion/extraction of Li+/Na+ ion with rapid transport kinetics, as well as inhibiting the re-stacking of SnS2 nanosheets during the charge/discharge cycling. The density functional theory calculation reveals the most stable state of the moderate interlayer spacing for the sandwich-like composite. The diffusion coefficients of Li/Na-ions from both molecular simulation and experimental observation also demonstrate that that this state is the most suitable for fast ions transport. In addition, numerous ultra-tiny SnS2 nanoparticles anchored on the graphene sheets can generate dominant pseudocapacitive contribution to the composite especially at large current density, guaranteeing its excellent high-rate performance with 844 and 765 mAh g-1 for Li/Na-ion batteries even at 10 A g‒1. No distinct morphology changes occur after 200 cycles, and the SnS2 nanoparticles still recover to pristine phase without distinct agglomeration, demonstrate that this composite with high rate capabilities and excellent cycle stability are the promising candidate for lithium/sodium storage."

        "abstract": "Hard carbon is regarded as the most promising anode material for commercialization of Na ion batteries because of its high capacity and low cost. At present, the practical utilization of hard carbon anodes is largely limited by the low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). Na ions have been found to adopt an adsorption–insertion storage mechanism. In this paper a systematic way to control the defect concentration and porosity of hard carbon with similar overall architectures is shown. This study elucidates that the defects in the graphite layers are directly related to the ICE as they would trap Na ions and create a repulsive electric field for other Na ions so as to shorten the low‐voltage intercalation capacity. The obtained low defect and porosity hard carbon electrode has achieved the highest ICE of 86.1% (94.5% for pure hard carbon material by subtracting that of the conductive carbon black), reversible capacity of 361 mA h g−1, and excellent cycle stability (93.4% of capacity retention over 100 cycles). This result sheds light on feasible design principles for high performance Na storage hard carbon: suitable carbon layer distance and defect free graphitic layers."

Ultrathin and conformal TiO2 layers are used to modify the surface of MoS2 by atomic layer deposition. The electrochemical performance measurements demonstrate that the ALD TiO2 layer can improve the cycling stability and rate capability of MoS2. The MoS2 nanosheets with 0.5-nm TiO2 coating electrode show the highest initial discharge capacity of 1392 mA h g-1 at 200 mA g-1, which is increased by 53% compared with that of bare MoS2. After 150 cycles, the capacity retention rate of the TiO2-coated MoS2 achieves 75.8% of its second cycle's capacity at 200 mA h g-1 in contrast to that of 59% of pure MoS2. Furthermore, the mechanism behind the experimental results is revealed by ex situ scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterizations, which confirms that the ultrathin TiO2 modifications can prevent the structural degradation and the formation of SEI film of MoS2 electrode."

        "abstract": "Sodium ion battery (SIB) as a next‐generation battery has been drawing much attention due to the abundance and even distribution of sodium source. Metal sulfides with high theoretical capacity and good electrical conductivity are promising anode candidates for SIB, however, the structural collapse caused by severe volume change during the de/sodiation process typically results in a fast capacity decay, limited rate capability, and cycling stability. In this work, by careful composition and structure design, polydopamine coated Prussian blue analogs derived carbon coated bimetallic sulfide hollow nanocubes (PBCS) are prepared with distinguished morphology, higher surface area, smaller charge transfer resistance, and higher sodium diffusion coefficient than the uncoated bimetallic sulfides. An optimum carbon coated bimetallic sulfide hollow nanocube anode delivers a specific capacity of ≈500 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 with ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (1:1, vol%) electrolyte in the presence of fluoroethylene carbonate additives. A capacity of 122.3 mA h g−1 can be realized at 5000 mA g−1, showing good rate performance. In addition the carbon coated bimetallic sulfide hollow nanocubes can maintain capacity of 87 mA h g−1 after being cycled at 500 mA g−1 for 150 times, indicating its good cycling stability. The structure integrity, high specific capacity, good rate performance, and cycling stability of PBCS render it a promising anode material for advanced SIB."

Here, a new method is developed to prepare pre-sodiated carbonaceous anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) from cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) under microwave irradiation for potential ultrafast and large-scale manufacturing. While direct carbonization of CNFs through microwave treatment is usually impossible due to the weak microwave absorption of CNFs, it is found that a small amount of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) can act as an effective initiator. Microwaving rGO releases extremely high energy, giving rise to local ultrahigh temperature as well as ultrahigh heating rate, which then induces the fast carbonization of CNFs and the production of pre-sodiated carbonaceous materials within seconds. The sodium in the carbonaceous materials, introduced from the carbonization of CNFs containing sodium-ion carboxyl, offer favorable spaces for sodiation/desodiation, which improves the electrochemical performance of the sodium-inserted carbonaceous anode. When the microwaved rGO-CNF (MrGO-CNF) is used as an anode for SIBs, a high initial capacity of 558 mAh g-1 is delivered and the capacity of 340 mAh g-1 remains after 200 cycles.

The P-CNT hybrid was synthesized through ball-milling of red phosphorus and carboxylic group functionalized carbon nanotubes. The P-O-C bonds formed in this process help maintain contact between phosphorus and CNTs, leading to a durable hybrid. In addition, cross-linked carboxymethyl cellulose-citric acid binder was used to form a robust electrode. As a result, this anode delivers a stable cycling capacity of 1586.2 mAh/g after 100 cycles, along with high initial Coulombic efficiency of 84.7% and subsequent cycling efficiency of ∼99%. The unique electrode framework through chemical bonding strategy reported here is potentially inspirable for other electrode materials with large volume change in use."

        "abstract": "We systematically investigated the potential of single-layer VS2 polytypes as Na-battery anode materials via density functional theory calculations. We found that sodiation tends to inhibit the 1H-to-1T structural phase transition, in contrast to lithiation-induced transition on monolayer MoS2. Thus, VS2 can have better structural stability in the cycles of charging and discharging. Diffussion of Na atom was found to be very fast on both polytypes, with very small diffusion barriers of 0.085 eV (1H) and 0.088 eV (1T). Ab initio random structure searching was performed in order to explore stable configurations of Na on VS2. Our search found that both the V top and the hexagonal center sites are preferred adsorption sites for Na, with the 1H phase showing a relatively stronger binding. Notably, our random structures search revealed that Na clusters can form as a stacked second layer at full Na concentration, which is not reported in earlier works wherein uniform, single-layer Na adsorption phases were assumed. With reasonably high specific energy capacity (232.91 and 116.45 mAh/g for 1H and 1T phases, respectively) and open-circuit voltage (1.30 and 1.42 V for 1H and 1T phases, respectively), VS2 is a promising alternative material for Na-ion battery anodes with great structural sturdiness. Finally, we have shown the capability of the ab initio random structure searching in the assessment of potential materials for energy storage applications."

To overcome this problem, we reported a facile strategy to compensate the irreversible capacity loss of HC anodes simply by a chemical presodiation reaction of the HC electrode with a sodiation reagent (sodium biphenyl, Na-Bp). Benefiting from the strong sodiation ability of Na-Bp, HC anode can be presodiated rapidly in a very short time and the presodiated HC (NaxHC) is found to have a desirable ICE of 100%. When coupled with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode to build a SIB full cell, the NaxHC||Na3V2(PO4)3 cell exhibit a high ICE of ~95.0% and an elevated energy density of 218 Wh kg-1, which is far superior to that of control cell using pristine HC anode (50% ICE and 120 Wh kg-1), suggesting great advantages brought by the chemical presodiation process. More importantly, this presodiation reaction is very mild, highly eﬃcient and can be widely extended to a variety of Na-storage materials, offering a new route to develop high performance Na-storage materials for practical battery applications."

Metal sulfides have been demonstrated as prospective anode materials for SIBs based on a conversion mechanism. However, insufficient ionic transport and low conductivity in discharge electrodes prohibit their practical application. Herein, novel CuS microflowers were prepared by a facile dealloying method and applied as anode for SIBs. The microflowers are composed of nanosheets, which can provide increased Na+ diffusion admittance and more inter-space volume to accommodate volumetric change. When applied as anode in SIBs, the CuS microflowers-based anode delivered high discharge capacity (325.6 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1) and excellent rate performance. The anode also displayed ultra-stable cycle performance and almost no capacity decay even after 5000 cycles (at a current density of 5 A g−1). Ex situ XRD was carried out to disclose the sodium ion storage mechanism. The CuS microflowers-based anode first experienced intercalation and then conversion mechanism with successive sodiation processes, while the reverse was observed for the charging process. The superior electrochemical performance is associated with the nano-micro structure and the controlled reaction mechanism. The current study states briefly that the simple and efficient dealloying method will provide more choices for fabricating anodes for SIBs."

Cost-efficient reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has been intensively studied as both an active material and a functional additive in SIBs. However, the sodiation–desodiation process in rGO is not fully understood. In this study, we investigate the interaction of the Na ion with rGO by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). For the first time, we observe reversible Na metal cluster (with a diameter of >10 nm) deposition on a rGO surface, which we evidence with an atom-resolved high-resolution TEM image of Na metal. This discovery leads to a porous reduced graphene oxide SIB anode with record high reversible specific capacity around 450 mAh/g at 25 mA/g, a high rate performance of 200 mAh/g at 250 mA/g, and stable cycling performance up to 750 cycles. In addition, direct observation of irreversible formation of Na2O on rGO unveils the origin of the commonly observed low first Co..."

        "abstract": "Sodium resources are inexpensive and abundant, and hence, sodium-ion batteries are promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries. However, lower energy density and poor cycling stability of current sodium-ion batteries prevent their practical implementation for future smart power grid and stationary storage applications. Tin oxides (SnO2) can be potentially used as a high-capacity anode material for future sodium-ion batteries, and they have the advantages of high sodium storage capacity, high abundance, and low toxicity. However, SnO2-based anodes still cannot be used in practical sodium-ion batteries because they experience large volume changes during repetitive charge and discharge cycles. Such large volume changes lead to severe pulverization of the active material and loss of electrical contact between the SnO2 and carbon conductor, which in turn result in rapid capacity loss during cycling. Here, we introduce a new amorphous carbon-coated SnO2-electrodeposited porous carbon nanofiber (PCNF@SnO2@C) composite that not only has high sodium storage capability, but also maintains its structural integrity while ongoing repetitive cycles. Electrochemical results revealed that this SnO2-containing nanofiber composite anode had excellent electrochemical performance including high-capacity (374 mAh g(-1)), good capacity retention (82.7%), and large Coulombic efficiency (98.9% after 100th cycle)."

        "abstract": "Red phosphorus (P) has attracted intense attention as promising anode material for high‐energy density sodium‐ion batteries (NIBs), owing to its high sodium storage theoretical capacity (2595 mAh g−1). Nevertheless, natural insulating property and large volume variation of red P during cycling result in extremely low electrochemical activity, leading to poor electrochemical performance. Herein, the authors demonstrate a rational strategy to improve sodium storage performance of red P by confining nanosized amorphous red P into zeolitic imidazolate framework‐8 (ZIF‐8) ‐derived nitrogen‐doped microporous carbon matrix (denoted as P@N‐MPC). When used as anode for NIBs, the P@N‐MPC composite displays a high reversible specific capacity of ≈600 mAh g−1 at 0.15 A g−1 and improved rate capacity (≈450 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 1000 cycles with an extremely low capacity fading rate of 0.02% per cycle). The superior sodium storage performance of the P@N‐MPC is mainly attributed to the novel structure. The N‐doped porous carbon with sub‐1 nm micropore facilitates the rapid diffusion of organic electrolyte ions and improves the conductivity of the encapsulated red P. Furthermore, the porous carbon matrix can buffer the volume change of red P during repeat sodiation/desodiation process, keeping the structure intact after long cycle life."

However, the DIBs based on sodium-ion electrolytes are seldom reported due to the lack of appropriate anode materials for reversible Na+ insertion/extraction. Herein, a new sodium-ion based DIB named as MoS2 /C-G DIB using penne-like MoS2 /C nanotube as anode and expanded graphite as cathode is constructed and optimized for the first time. The hierarchical MoS2 /C nanotube provides expanded (002) interlayer spacing of 2H-MoS2 , which facilitates fast Na+ insertion/extraction reaction kinetics, thus contributing to improved DIB performance. The MoS2 /C-G DIB delivers a reversible capacity of 65 mA h g-1 at 2 C in the voltage window of 1.0-4.0 V, with good cycling performance for 200 cycles and 85% capacity retention, indicating the feasibility of potential applications for sodium-ion based DIBs."

        "abstract": "Taking advantage of sodium polyacrylate, composed of interlaced carbon chains and inorganic functional groups (–COONa) uniformly grafted onto the carbon chains, a three-dimensional hard carbon matrix (3DHCM) has been obtained. The resultant material is composed of three-dimensional macroporous interconnected networks of carbon nanosheets (thickness, 5–30 nm). The 3DHCM has been studied as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries. The unique three-dimensional porous structure results in a high initial charge capacity of 341 mA h g−1, stable cycling capacity of 232.8 mA h g−1 (after 100 cycles, 50 mA g−1), superior-rate performance (stable capacities of 210, 197, 128 and 112 mA h g−1 at 200, 500, 5000, 8000 mA g−1, respectively) and ultralong cycle life (116 mA h g−1 at 4 A g−1 after 3000 cycles). At the same time, an increase in the trend of the sloping capacity percentage at total discharge is observed. More obvious “graphitic” domains with larger interplanar spacing (∼0.46 nm) were produced in the electrochemical cycles and detected using ex situ HRTEM, further confirming that the first higher-voltage region (above 0.1 V) should be attributed to the sodium insertion between the parallel graphene layers in the hard carbon. We also find that the electrolyte (1 M NaClO4 in PC) severely decomposes at the electrode/electrolyte interface during deep electrochemical cycles (6000 cycles), resulting in the deterioration of the electrode and fast capacity fading. Furthermore, a room-temperature sodium-ion full cell was constructed using 3DHCM as an anode and Na3V2(PO4)3/C as a cathode, (−) 3DHCM‖1 M NaClO4 in PC‖Na3V2(PO4)3/C (+), delivering a discharge capacity of 90 mA h g−1 at a current density of 500 mA g−1. We believe that our findings will be helpful in speeding up the development of room-temperature high-rate, long life and low cost sodium-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage systems, and even as alternatives to lithium-ion batteries."

Electrochemical measurements show that it exhibits a comparable or higher reversible capacity than T-Na4Ti5O12. Neutron powder diffraction reveals the preferred sites and occupancies of the excess sodium. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction under electrochemical cycling shows that the crystal lattice undergoes strongly anisotropic volume changes during cycling."

In this work, we report a carbon nanotube decorated nano-NaTi2(PO4)3/C anode composite to achieve high-rate capability (116.8 mA h g−1 at 1C, 113.3 mA h g−1 at 10C and 103.4 mA h g−1 at 50C) and stable cyclability (about 98% capacity retention at 50C of 1000 cycles) as well as impressive low-temperature performance (about 65.2 mA h g−1 at 10C at a temperature of minus 20 °C). The carbon nanotube network not only improved electrolyte infiltration to decrease the internal diffusion resistance, but also provides fast transport pathways for electrons to enhance the poor electronic conductivity of the NaTi2(PO4)3 anodes.

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries as a prospective alternative to lithium‐ion batteries are facing the challenge of developing high‐performance, low‐cost and sustainable anode materials. Hard carbons are appropriate to store sodium ions, but major energy and environmental concerns during their fabrication process (i.e., high‐temperature carbonization) have not been properly assessed. Furthermore, the rational design of high‐performing hard carbon anodes is usually limited by the conventional direct carbonization of organic precursors. Here, the hydrothermal carbonization process is employed as a versatile pre‐treatment method of renewable precursors, followed by high‐temperature carbonization, for producing advanced hard carbon anodes. The critical role of hydrothermal pre‐treatment in regulating the structure for an optimized performance of hard carbon anodes is elucidated, while revealing the sodium‐ion storage mechanism using electrochemical kinetic calculations, advanced characterization and multi‐scale modeling. Furthermore, the environmental impacts of hydrothermal pre‐treatment and subsequent carbonization are evaluated using life cycle assessment compared to direct carbonization. By comparing hard carbon anodes with and without the hydrothermal pre‐treatment, it is verified that the additional hydrothermal process is responsible for enhanced electrochemical performance, increased carbon yields and reduced carbon emissions. The work provides a systematic understanding of functions and energy consumptions of hydrothermal systems to achieve next‐generation sustainable sodium‐ion batteries."

The reversible capacity of the nanocolumnar films was found to be 430 mAh/g, which is higher than the theoretical capacity of 369 mAh/g. The nanocolumnar films retained 88% of their initial capacity after 100 cycles at C/5, whereas the dense films began to deteriorate after ∼15 cycles. Additionally, the nanocolumnar films were stable at charge/discharge rates up to 27C (10 A/g). The diffusion coefficient for sodium in germanium was estimated, from impedance analysis of the dense films, to be ∼10–13 cm2 s–1. Modeling of diffusion in the sodium- germanium system predicts that sodium diffusion in the near-surface layers of the material is significantly faster than in the bulk. These results show that small feature sizes are critical for rapid, reversible electrochemical sodiation of germanium."

Graphyne (GY) and graphdiyne (GDY) is the single atomic layer structure of carbon six-member rings connected by one and two acetylenic linkages, respectively. Our calculated results indicate that a novel atomic hollow structure of graphyne and graphdiyne made up of sp- and sp2-hybridized carbon atoms reinforces not only the Na storage capacity but also the Na diffusion. For GY and GDY, the maximum sodium storage concentration is NaC4 and NaC3, respectively, far exceeding the upper limit of Na insertion into graphite to form the stage-II compound NaC12 and being also superior to the case of Li inserting into graphite to form LiC6. By only overcoming a smaller energy barrier of about 0.4 eV, Na ions can easily achieve two-dimensional diffusion on GY and GDY plane.

Recently, a new type of metal‐ion battery that utilizes K+ ions in its operating principle has attracted significant attention due to a possibility of building high voltage cells using an abundant potassium ionic shuttle. Establishing promising electrode materials is of paramount importance for this new type of battery. This feature article summarizes available early results on the alloying–dealloying anode materials in potassium electrochemical cells. Based on original research (some data are presented for the first time) and independently published literature, experimental results on silicon, tin, phosphorus, antimony, and lead‐containing anodes are critically discussed. The electrochemical properties, charge storage mechanisms, and achievable capacities are considered. The results are compared with the behaviors of the same materials in lithium and sodium cells, and the importance of the volumetric parameters of electrodes is emphasized. Finally, a number of further research directions in these interesting anode materials are suggested.

        "abstract": "Engineering of 3D graphene/metal composites with ultrasmall sized metal and robust metal–graphene interfacial interaction for energy storage application is still a challenge and rarely reported. In this work, a facile top‐down strategy is developed for the preparation of SnSb‐in‐plane nanoconfined 3D N‐doped porous graphene networks for sodium ion battery anodes, which are composed of several tens of interconnected empty N‐graphene boxes in‐plane firmly embedded with ultrasmall SnSb nanocrystals. The all‐around encapsulation (plane‐to‐plane contact) architecture that provides a large interface between N‐graphene and SnSb nanocrystal not only effectively enhances the electron conductivity and structural integrity of the overall electrode, but also offers excess interfacial sodium storage, thus leading to much enhanced high‐rate sodium storage capacity and stability, which has been proven by both experimental results and first‐principles simulations. Moreover, this top‐down strategy can enable new paths to the low‐cost and high‐yield synthesis of 3D graphene/metal composites for applications in energy‐related fields and beyond."

The CoSe2@BCN‐750 nanotubes deliver an excellent storage capacity of 580 mA h g−1 at current density of 100 mA g−1 at 100th cycle, as the anode of a sodium ion battery.

This study details a novel method that involves single‐step laser‐based transformation of urea‐containing polyimide into an expanded 3D graphene anode, with simultaneous doping of high concentrations of nitrogen (≈13 at%). The versatile nature of this laser‐scribing approach enables direct bonding of the 3D graphene anode to the current collectors without the need for binders or conductive additives, which presents a clear advantage over chemical or hydrothermal methods. It is shown that these conductive and expanded 3D graphene structures perform exceptionally well as anodes for Na‐ion batteries. Specifically, an initial coulombic efficiency (CE) up to 74% is achieved, which exceeds that of most reported carbonaceous anodes, such as hard carbon and soft carbon. In addition, Na‐ion capacity up to 425 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 has been achieved with excellent rate capabilities. Further, a capacity of 148 mAh g−1 at a current density of 10 A g−1 is obtained with excellent cycling stability, opening a new direction for the fabrication of 3D graphene anodes directly on current collectors for metal ion battery anodes as well as other potential applications."

        "abstract": "Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2 ), a 2D-layered compound, is regarded as a promising anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its attractive theoretical capacity and low cost. The main challenges associated with MoS2 are the low rate capability suffering from the sluggish kinetics of Na+ intercalation and the poor cycling stability owning to the stack of MoS2 sheets. In this work, a unique architecture of bundled defect-rich MoS2 (BD-MoS2 ) that consists of MoS2 with large vacancies bundled by ultrathin MoO3 is achieved via a facile quenching process. When employed as anode for a SIB, the BD-MoS2 electrode exhibits an ultrafast charge/discharge due to the pseudocapacitive-controlled Na+ storage mechanism in it. Further experimental and theoretical calculations show that Na+ is able to cross the MoS2 layer by vacancies, not only limited to diffusion along the layer, thus realizing a 3D Na+ diffusion with faster kinetics. Meanwhile, the bundling architecture reduces the stack of sheets with a superior cycle life illustrating the highly reversible capacities of 350 and 272 mAh g-1 at 2 and 5 A g-1 after 1000 cycles."

Searching for high‐performance anode materials currently becomes a hot topic and also a great challenge for developing Na‐ion batteries. In this work, a novel hybrid anode is synthesized consisting of ultrafine, few‐layered SnS2 anchored on few‐layered reduced graphene oxide (rGO) by a facile solvothermal route. The SnS2/rGO hybrid exhibits a high capacity, ultralong cycle life, and superior rate capability. The hybrid can deliver a high charge capacity of 649 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1. At 800 mA g−1 (1.8 C), it can yield an initial charge capacity of 469 mAh g−1, which can be maintained at 89% and 61%, respectively, after 400 and 1000 cycles. The hybrid can also sustain a current density up to 12.8 A g−1 (≈28 C) where the charge process can be completed in only 1.3 min while still delivering a charge capacity of 337 mAh g−1. The fast and stable Na‐storage ability of SnS2/rGO makes it a promising anode for Na‐ion batteries."

        "abstract": "The demand for electrochemical energy storage technologies is rapidly increasing due to the proliferation of renewable energy sources and the emerging markets of grid‐scale battery applications. The properties of batteries are ideal for most electrical energy storage (EES) needs, yet, faced with resource constraints, the ability of current lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) to match this overwhelming demand is uncertain. Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are a novel class of batteries with similar performance characteristics to LIBs. Since they are composed of earth‐abundant elements, cheaper and utility scale battery modules can be assembled. As a result of the learning curve in the LIB technology, a phenomenal progression in material development has been realized in the SIB technology. In this review, innovative strategies used in SIB material development, and the electrochemical properties of anode, cathode, and electrolyte combinations are elucidated. Attractive performance characteristics are herein evidenced, based on comparative gravimetric and volumetric energy densities to state‐of‐the‐art LIBs. In addition, opportunities and challenges toward commercialization are herein discussed based on patent data trend analysis. With extensive industrial adaptations expected, the commercial prospects of SIBs look promising and this once discarded technology is set to play a major role in EES applications."

        "abstract": "Narrow electrochemical stability window (1.23 V) of aqueous electrolytes is always considered the key obstacle preventing aqueous sodium‐ion chemistry of practical energy density and cycle life. The sodium‐ion water‐in‐salt electrolyte (NaWiSE) eliminates this barrier by offering a 2.5 V window through suppressing hydrogen evolution on anode with the formation of a Na+‐conducting solid‐electrolyte interphase (SEI) and reducing the overall electrochemical activity of water on cathode. A full aqueous Na‐ion battery constructed on Na0.66[Mn0.66Ti0.34]O2 as cathode and NaTi2(PO4)3 as anode exhibits superior performance at both low and high rates, as exemplified by extraordinarily high Coulombic efficiency (>99.2%) at a low rate (0.2 C) for >350 cycles, and excellent cycling stability with negligible capacity losses (0.006% per cycle) at a high rate (1 C) for >1200 cycles. Molecular modeling reveals some key differences between Li‐ion and Na‐ion WiSE, and identifies a more pronounced ion aggregation with frequent contacts between the sodium cation and fluorine of anion in the latter as one main factor responsible for the formation of a dense SEI at lower salt concentration than its Li cousin."

A novel air‐stable O3‐type Na[Li0.05Mn0.50Ni0.30Cu0.10Mg0.05]O2 is synthesized by a coprecipitation method suitable for mass production followed by high‐temperature annealing. The microscale secondary particle, consisting of numerous primary nanocrystals, can efficiently facilitate sodium‐ion transport due to the short diffusion distance, and this cathode material also has inherent advantages for practical application because of its superior physical properties. It exhibits a reversible capacity of 172 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C and remarkable capacity retention of 70.4% after 1000 cycles at 20 C. More importantly, it offers good compatibility with pristine hard carbon as anode in the sodium‐ion full cell system, delivering a high energy density of up to 215 W h kg−1 at 0.1 C and good rate performance. Owing to the high industrial feasibility of the synthesis process, good compatibility with pristine hard carbon anode, and excellent electrochemical performance, it can be considered as a promising active material to promote progress toward sodium‐ion battery commercialization."

        "abstract": "Graphene‐based nanomaterials have sprung up as promising anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries due to the intriguing properties of graphene itself and the synergic effect between graphene and active materials. However, the 2D graphene sheet only allows the rapid diffusion of sodium ions along the parallel direction while that of the vertical direction is difficult, limiting the rate capability of graphene‐based electrode materials. To tackle this problem, pore‐forming engineering has been employed to perforate graphene and concurrently achieve the in situ growth of Co3Se4 nanoparticles. The generation of in‐plane nanohole breaks through the physical barriers of the graphene nanosheets, enabling the fast diffusion of electrolyte ions in the longitudinal direction. In addition, this design limits the aggregation of Co3Se4 nanoparticles because of the high affinity of Co3Se4 on graphene. Benefiting from the high conductivity and fast ion transport bestowed by the ingenious architecture, the Co3Se4/holey graphene exhibits a remarkable rate performance of 519.5 mAh g−1 at 5.0 A g−1 and desirable cycle stability. Conclusions drawn from this investigation are that the transport of sodium inside the graphene‐based composites is crucial for rate performance enhancement and this method is effective in modifying graphene‐based nanomaterials as potential anode materials."

Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered to be a promising alternative to conventional LIBs for future large-scale commercial applications, due to the abundance and low cost of sodium resources and similar physical and chemical properties to lithium.[9–12] However, as the radius of Na+ is about 1.4 times larger than Li+, it is undoubtedly a barrier for the development of SIBs due to the lack of appropriate cathode and anode materials with reversible sodiation/desodiation.[10] In addition, the huge volume variation during intercalation/deintercalation of the larger Na+ also causes severe structural distortion, leading to poor cycling stability and rate performance.[11] Consequently, extensive efforts have been dedicated to developing new electrode materials for high-performance SIBs. For instance, cathode materials such as NaxCoO2, Na2Fe2(SO4)3, Na3V2(PO4)3, and NaxNi0.22Co0.11Mn0.66O2 have been studied and shown encouraging results. Nevertheless, the energy density of SIBs is still hindered by the moderate capacity and working voltage. Combining SIB technique with DIB technique is a promising strategy to improve the energy density, yet few works about DIBs based on sodium-ion electrolytes have been reported.[13] In this work, we first reported a novel tin-graphite DIB (named as Sn-G DIB) based on a sodium-ion electrolyte containing NaPF6 salt, using Sn foil directly as both anode and current collector, and expanded graphite as cathode. It is worthy to note that the Sn-G DIB can work reversibly with high capacity in the sodium-ion electrolyte over a high voltage window of 2.0–4.8 V. This battery delivers 74 mA h g−1 at 2 C (1 C corresponding to 100 mA g−1) current rate and keeps stable for 400 cycles with 94% capacity retention and high Coulombic efficiency of 95%. In addition, the packaged energy density of the Sn-G DIB achieves at 144 W h kg−1 at a power density of 150 W kg−1, which is surprisingly comparable with commercial lithium-ion batteries. Figure 1a schematically illustrates the working mechanism of the Sn-G DIB based on 1 m NaPF6 in a mixed solvent of ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) (1:1:1 v/v/v). During the charging state, PF6 anions intercalate into the graphite cathode, and Na+ cations move onto the Sn foil anode to form Na-Sn alloy (which would be demonstrated in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) Intercalation of lithium ions into anode materials of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely studied for decades.[1] For example, graphite, which has been used as a commercial anode material, can be intercalated by Li+ and form LiC6 compound with a theoretical capacity of 372 mA h g−1.[2] Actually, the phenomenon of anions intercalation into graphite has also been observed due to the redox amphotericity of graphite, which however has attracted much less attention. In 1938, Rüdorff and Hofmann first reported anion intercalation into graphite as the cathode material for battery application.[3] By utilizing this mechanism, a novel rechargeable battery configuration named as dual-ion battery (DIB), based on both cation and anion intercalation into graphite in nonaqueous electrolytes, has also been first proposed by McCullough et al. in patents[4a,b] and Carlin et al. in their work.[4c] During the charge process, the Li+ ions are intercalated into graphite anode, while the anions are intercalated into graphite cathode simultaneously. During the discharge process, the deintercalation reactions take place on both electrodes reversely. In this DIB system, both the two graphite electrodes and the electrolyte act as active materials. Compared to conventional LIBs, one obvious advantage of the DIBs is the replacement of expensive transition metal oxide by low-cost graphite as the cathode to obtain higher working voltages (mainly above 4.5 V).[5] Subsequent researches were mainly focused on finding suitable electrolyte compositions,[5a–c] high-capacity cathode materials,[5d] and matched anode materials.[5e] Read et al. reported a dual-graphite battery using a high-voltage organic electrolyte based on a fluorinated solvent.[6] The battery delivered a reversible capacity of 60 mA h g−1 with a capacity retention of 62% after 50 cycles at C/7 under cut-off voltage of 5.2 V. Placke and co-workers demonstrated a highly stable dual-graphite battery based on an ionic liquid electrolyte with solid electrolyte interface (SEI) forming additive.[7] The DIB presented good cycling stability with a discharge capacity of 50 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1 for 500 cycles. Although these DIBs show potential application as a promising energy storage device with merits of high voltage, environmental friendly, safe,"

        "abstract": "The low-cost and scalable sodium ion (Na-ion) batteries serve as an ideal alternative to the current lithium-ion batteries. To compensate the shortage of energy density, the most accessible solution is developing a high-voltage anode-free configuration composing a lightweight Al current collector on the anode and a high-voltage sodiumized cathode. However, it imposes stringent Na reversibility and high-voltage stability requirements on the electrolyte. Upon the request, a 3A zeolite molecular sieve film is rationally designed, and a highly aggregated solvation structure is constructed through the size effect. It successfully suppresses trace but continuous oxidative decomposition and extends the oxidative stability to 4.5 V without sacrificing the Na reversibility of the anode (99.91%). Therefore, we harvest anode-free cells with high energy density of 369 and 372 W h kg-1 for 4.0 and 4.25 V class cells, respectively. Furthermore, this strategy enables a long lifespan (250 cycles) for 4.0 V-class anode-free cells and a substantially reduced cost in a sustainable way."

        "abstract": "Metal phosphides are promising anode candidates for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high specific capacity and low operating potential but suffer from poor cycling stability caused by huge volume expansion and poor solid‐state ion transfer rate. Herein, a new strategy to grow a new class of mesoporous metal phosphide nanoarrays on carbon felt (CF) as binder‐free anodes for SIBs is reported. The resultant integrated electrodes demonstrate excellent cycling life up to 1000 times (>90% retention rate) and high rate capability of 535 mAh g−1 at a current density of 4 A g−1. Detailed characterization reveals that the synergistic effect of unique mesoporous structure for accommodating huge volume expansion during sodiation/desodiation process, ultrasmall primary particle size (≈10 nm) for providing larger electrode/electrolyte contact area and shorter ion diffusion distance, and 3D conductive networks for facilitating the electrochemical reaction, leads to the extraordinary battery performance. Remarkably, a full SIB using the new CoP4/CF anode and a Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode delivers an average operating voltage of ≈3.0 V, a reversible capacity of 553 mAh g−1, and very high energy density of ≈280 Wh kg−1 for SIBs. A flexible SIB with outstanding mechanical strength based on this binder‐free new anode is also demonstrated."

So far, the reported energy density and cycling stability of the Sb-based anodes for SIBs are quite limited and need to be significantly improved. Here, we develop a novel Sb/C hybrid encapsulating the Sb nanorods into highly conductive N and S codoped carbon (Sb@(N, S-C)) frameworks. As an anode for SIBs, the Sb@(N, S-C) hybrid maintains high reversible capacities of 621.1 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 150 cycles, and 390.8 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 1000 cycles. At higher current densities of 2, 5, and 10 A g-1, the Sb@(N, S-C) hybrid also can display high reversible capacities of 534.4, 430.8, and 374.7 mAh g-1, respectively. Such impressive sodium storage properties are mainly attributed to the unique cross-linked carbon networks providing highly conductive frameworks for fast transfer of ions and electrons, alleviating the volume expansion and preventing the agglomeration of Sb nanorods during the cycling."

        "abstract": "The incorporation of oxygen vacancies in anatase TiO2 has been studied as a promising way to accelerate the transport of electrons and Na+ ions, which is important for achieving excellent electrochemical properties for anatase TiO2. However, wittingly introducing oxygen vacancies in anatase TiO2 for sodium-ion anodes by a facile and effective method is still a challenge. In this work, we report an innovative method to introduce oxygen vacancies into the urchin-like N-doped carbon coated anatase TiO2 (NC-DTO) by a facile plasma treatment. The superiorities of the oxygen vacancies combined with the conductive N-doped carbon coating enable the obtained NC-DTO of greatly improved sodium storage performance. When served as the anode for sodium-ion batteries, the NC-DTO electrode shows superior electrochemical performance (capacity: 272 mA h g-1 at 0.25 C, capacity retention: 98.8% after 5000 cycles at 10 C, as well as ultrahigh capacity: 150 mA h g-1 at 15 C). Density functional theory calculations combined with experimental results suggest that considerably improved sodium storage performance of NC-DTO is due to the enhanced electronic conductivity from the N-doped carbon layer as well as narrowed band gap and lowered sodiation energy barrier from the introduction of oxygen vacancies. This work highlights that introducing oxygen vacancies into TiO2 by plasma is a promising method to enhance the electrochemical property of TiO2, which also can be applied to different metal oxides for energy storage devices."

However, the large volume variation during electrochemical cycling makes it difficult to use for practical applications. Herein, the reversible performance of BP in SIB is significantly enhanced by bridging covalently functionalized BP on graphene. The enhanced interaction between the chemical functionalized BP and graphene improves the stability of BP during long-cycle running of SIB. The bridging reduces the surface energy and increases thickness of BP available for enlarging the channel between BP nanosheet and graphene. The enlarged channel stores more sodium ions for improving cycle performance. Significantly, two types of phosphorus-carbon bond are first detected during experimental analysis. Benefiting from the strategy, the BP-based SIB anode exhibits 1472 mAh g-1 specific capacity at 0.1 A g-1 in the 50th cycle and 650 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 200 cycles."

        "abstract": "Engineering strategies based on “nanostructuring” and “active/inactive composites” are commonly used separately to improve the performance of alkali‐ion battery electrodes. Here, these two strategies are merged to further enhance the performance of alloy‐type alkali‐ion battery anodes. Specifically, macroporous antimony (Sb)/magnesium fluoride (MgF2) active/inactive composite material is used as a high‐performance Na‐ion battery anode. The porous Sb phase with pore size in the sub‐micrometer range acts as the electrochemically active component and the electrochemically inactive dense MgF2 phase acts as a mechanical buffer. Na‐ion battery anodes made of porous Sb/MgF2 active/inactive composites are reversibly sodiated for over 300 cycles, delivering a capacity of ≈551 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles at a C‐rate of C/2. This performance is remarkable because the porous Sb/MgF2 composite is not made of mesoporous structures. Furthermore, the cycling longevity of this porous Sb/MgF2 composite outperforms the common nanostructured Sb‐based Na‐ion battery anode materials. This good performance is attributed to the “porous active/inactive” configuration, where the dense inactive mechanical buffer phase absorbs part of the phase transformation‐induced stresses, while porosity in the active phase helps to accommodate the phase transformation induced volume expansions and electrolyte transfer into the bulk of this composite."

The capacity ascending phenomenon can also extend to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).

Up to the present, the anode material still remains a great challenge for the application of SIBs, especially at room temperature. Graphite has an obvious limitation to store larger radius sodium ions (Na+) in comparison with lithium ions (Li+), while the hard carbon with large interlayer distance can demonstrate a relatively high storage capability and durable cycle life. However, the disadvantages of low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) mainly caused by large surface area and high cost synthetic approach hinder its practical applications. Herein, a new coupled carbonization strategy is presented to prepare a cost-effective hard carbon material by pyrolyzing and carbonizing the mixture of abundant sucrose and phenolic resin. Benefiting from the specialized pyrolysis reaction process and optimized conditions as studied in detail, the hard carbon has an extremely low surface area of 1.54 m2 g-1 and high initial Coulombic efficiency of 87%, which have been rarely reported before and enhance the utilization efficiency of Na+ consumption within the cathode in the future. More importantly, the hard carbon, with a high interlayer distance 3.95 Å, can deliver a higher capacity of 319 mAh g-1 and maintain a finer capacity retention of 90% over 150 cycles. Besides, a full cell with the configuration of as-prepared hard carbon anode versus an air-stable O3-Na0.9[Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48]O2 cathode is further presented, and it has a high ICE of 80% and energy density of 256 Wh kganode-1 (vs hard carbon) with reliable cycle performance.

Tin is one of most promising SIB anode materials, which alloys with up to 3.75 Na, leading to a charge storage capacity of 847 mAh g(-1). In this Account, we outline the state-of-the-art understanding regarding the sodiation-induced phase transformations and the associated performance in a range of Sn-based systems, treating metallic Sn and its alloys, tin oxide (SnO2), tin sulfide (SnS2/SnS), and tin phosphide (Sn4P3). We first detail what is known about the sodiation sequence in metallic Sn, highlighting the most recent insight into the reactions prior to the terminal equilibrium Na15Sn4 intermetallic. We explain why researchers argue that the equilibrium (phase diagram) series of phase transitions does not occur in this system, and rather why sodiation/desodiation proceeds through a series of metastable crystalline and amorphous structures. We also outline the recent modeling-based insight regarding how this phase transition profoundly influences the mechanical properties of the alloy, progressively changing the bonding and the near neighbor arrangement from \"Sn-like\" to \"Na-like\" in the process. We then go on to discuss the sodiation reactions in SnO2. We argue that while a substantial amount of experimental work already exists where the focus is on synthesis and testing of tin oxide-based nanocomposites, the exact sodiation sequence is just beginning to be understood. Unlike in Sn and Sn alloys, where capacities near the theoretical are reached at least early during cycling, SnO2 never quite achieves anything close to the 1398 mAh g(-1) that would be possible with a combination of fully reversible conversion and alloying reactions. We highlight recent work demonstrating that contrary to general expectations, it is the Sn to Na15Sn4 alloying reaction that is incomplete and hence limits the capacity of the electrode. We also describe how the oxide conversion reaction goes through an intermediate SnO phase, and how its reversibility in a half-cell is highly dependent on the terminal anodic voltage. We then present what is known about sodiation of tin sulfide and of tin phosphide phases, including emerging microstructural evidence that may explain why both the sulfides and the phosphides are unable to achieve their highly promising theoretical capacities under conventional electrode testing conditions. Finally, we provide a broad comparison of the capacity (cycling and rate) performance for a range of Sn based anode materials, and show that there may be indeed an optimum microstructural architecture."

        "abstract": "Emerging sodium‐ion batteries (NIBs) and potassium‐ion batteries (KIBs) show promise in complementing lithium‐ion battery (LIB) technology and diversifying the battery market. Hard carbon is a potential anode candidate for LIBs, NIBs, and KIBs due to its high capacity, sustainability, wide availability, and stable physicochemical properties. Herein, a series of hard carbons is synthesized by hydrothermal carbonization and subsequent pyrolysis at different temperatures to finely tune their structural properties. When tested as anodes, the hard carbons exhibit differing ion‐storage trends for Li, Na, and K, with NIBs achieving the highest reversible capacity. Extensive materials and electrochemical characterizations are carried out to study the correlation of structural features with electrochemical performance and to explain the specific mechanisms of alkali‐ion storage in hard carbons. In addition, the best‐performing hard carbon is tested against a sodium cathode Na3V2(PO4)3 in a Na‐ion pouch cell, displaying a high power density of 2172 W kg−1 at an energy density of 181.5 Wh kg−1 (based on the total weight of active materials in both anode and cathode). The Na‐ion pouch cell also shows stable ultralong‐term cycling (9000 h or 5142 cycles) and demonstrates the promising potential of such materials as sustainable, scalable anodes for beyond Li‐batteries."

In this paper, we describe a substrate, N-doped amorphous micron-sized carbon ribbons (AMCRs), derived from biomass from raupo, on which few-layer MoS2 nanosheets with enlarged interlayer spacings (≈0.75 nm) are anchored. The nitrogen-enriched AMCRs are economically prepared by a single pyrolysis step. The uniform distribution of nitrogen atoms enables ultra homogeneous growth of the MoS2 nanosheets on the AMCRs. The as-prepared AMCRs@MoS2 composite is fabricated as an anode material for SIBs, and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) are chosen as binders to mix the anode materials to compare their battery performance. The anode composite with CMC as the binder demonstrates an improved initial coulombic efficiency of 75.6%, a higher specific capacity (366 mA h g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1) and a better cycling stability (305 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles). The anode material composed of few-layer MoS2 anchored on low-cost nitrogen-doped AMCRs with CMC as the binder can be a competing candidate for large-scale SIB production."

The application of an antimony anode, on replacement of the sodium metal that is commonly used in sodium‐ion half‐cells, reduces significantly the interfacial resistance and charge transfer resistance of a sodium‐ion battery, which enables a smaller polarization for a sodium‐ion full‐cell Sb/Na3V2(PO4)3 running at relatively high charge and discharge rates. The incorporation of the gel‐polymer electrolyte is beneficial to maintain stable interfaces between the electrolyte and the electrodes of the sodium‐ion battery at elevated temperature. When running at 60 °C, the sodium‐ion full‐cell Sb/Na3V2(PO4)3 with the gel‐polymer electrolyte exhibits superior cycling stability compared to a battery with the conventional liquid electrolyte."

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries are now considered as a low‐cost alternative to lithium‐ion technologies for large‐scale energy storage applications; however, their safety is still a matter of great concern for practical applications. In this paper, a safer sodium‐ion battery is proposed by introducing a nonflammable phosphate electrolyte (trimethyl phosphate, TMP) coupled with NaNi0.35Mn0.35Fe0.3O2 cathode and Sb‐based alloy anode. The physical and electrochemical compatibilities of the TMP electrolyte are investigated by igniting, ionic conductivity, cyclic voltammetry, and charge–discharge measurements. The results exhibit that the TMP electrolyte with FEC additive is completely nonflammable and has wide electrochemical window (0–4.5 V vs. Na/Na+), in which both the Sb‐based anode and NaNi0.35Mn0.35Fe0.3O2 cathode show high reversible capacity and cycling stability, similarly as in carbonate electrolyte. Based on these results, a nonflammable sodium‐ion battery is constructed by use of Sb anode, NaNi0.35Mn0.35Fe0.3O2 cathode, and TMP + 10 vol% FEC electrolyte, which works very well with considerable capacity and cyclability, demonstrating a promising prospect to build safer sodium‐ion batteries for large‐scale energy storage applications."

        "abstract": "Structural phase transitions can be used to alter the properties of a material without adding any additional elements and are therefore of significant technological value. It was found that the hexagonal-SnS2 phase can be transformed into the orthorhombic-SnS phase after an annealing step in an argon atmosphere, and the thus transformed SnS shows enhanced sodium-ion storage performance over that of the SnS2, which is attributed to its structural advantages. Here, we provide the first report on a SnS@graphene architecture for application as a sodium-ion battery anode, which is built from two-dimensional SnS and graphene nanosheets as complementary building blocks. The as-prepared SnS@graphene hybrid nanostructured composite delivers an excellent specific capacity of 940 mAh g(-1)and impressive rate capability of 492 and 308 mAh g(-1) after 250 cycles at the current densities of 810 and 7290 mA g(-1), respectively. The performance was found to be much better than those of most reported anode materials for Na-ion batteries. On the basis of combined ex situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and ex situ X-ray diffraction, the formation mechanism of SnS@graphene and the synergistic Na-storage reactions of SnS in the anode are discussed in detail. The SnS experienced a two-structural-phase transformation mechanism (orthorhombic-SnS to cubic-Sn to orthorhombic-Na3.75Sn), while the SnS2 experienced a three-structural-phase transformation mechanism (hexagonal-SnS2 to tetragonal-Sn to orthorhombic-Na3.75Sn) during the sodiation process. The lesser structural changes of SnS during the conversion are expected to lead to good structural stability and excellent cycling stability in its sodium-ion battery performance. These results demonstrate that the SnS@graphene architecture offers unique characteristics suitable for high-performance energy storage application."

        "abstract": "With the increasing use of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), developing cost-effective anode materials, such as metal oxide, for Na-ion storage is one of the most attractive topics. Due to the obviously larger ion radius of Na than that of Li, most metal oxide electrode materials fail to exhibit the same high performance for SIBs like that of Li-ion batteries. Herein, iron oxide was employed to demonstrate a concept that rationally designing an amorphous structure should be useful to enhance Na-ion storage performance of a metal oxide. Amorphous Fe2O3/graphene composite nanosheets (Fe2O3@GNS) were successfully synthesized by a facile approach as anodes for SIBs. It reveals that amorphous Fe2O3 nanoparticles with an average diameter of 5 nm were uniformly anchored on the surface of graphene nanosheets by the strong C-O-Fe oxygen-bridge bond. Compared to well-crystalline Fe2O3, amorphous Fe2O3@GNS exhibited superior sodium storage properties such as high electrochemical activity, high initial Coulombic efficiency of 81.2%, and good rate performance. At a current density of 100 mA/g, amorphous Fe2O3@GNS composites show a specific capacity of 440 mAh/g, which is obviously higher than the specific capacity of 284 mAh/g of crystalline Fe2O3. Even at a high current density of 2 A/g, amorphous Fe2O3@GNS composites still exhibit a specific capacity as high as 219 mAh/g. The excellent electrochemical performance should be attributed to the amorphous structures of Fe2O3 as well as strongly interfacial interaction between Fe2O3 and GNS, which not only accommodate more electrochemical active sites and provide the more transmission channels for sodium ions but also benefit electron transfer as well as effectively buffer the volume change of host materials during sodiation and desodiation. This concept for designing amorphous iron oxide anodes for SIBs is also expected to facilitate preparation of various amorphous nanostructure of other metal oxides and improve their Na-ion storage performance."

Taking the MoO(3-x) nanosheet anode as an example, for the first time we demonstrate the benefits of OVs on SIB performance. Moreover, the benefits at deep-discharge conditions can be further promoted by an ultrathin Al2O3 coating. A series of measurements show that the OVs increase the electric conductivity and Na-ion diffusion coefficient, and the promotion from ultrathin coating lies in the effective reduction of cycling-induced solid-electrolyte interphase. The coated nanosheets exhibited high reversible capacity and great rate capability with the capacities of 283.9 (50 mA g(-1)) and 179.3 mAh g(-1) (1 A g(-1)) after 100 cycles.

First-principle calculations reveal that the Na2S/Na2Se interface possesses the lowest diffusion energy barrier (0.39 eV) of Na among three kinds of interface structures (Na2O/Na2S, Na2O/Na2Se, and Na2S/Na2Se) due to its smallest recorded interface deformation, similar electronegativity, and lattice constant.

        "abstract": "Recently, two-dimensional (2D) layered transition metal dichalcogenides (LTMDs) have attracted great scientific interest for ion battery applications. Because of its remarkable metallic property, vanadium disulfide (VS2) as a typical family member of LTMDs, can be an alternative anode material for ion battery applications. In this paper, we systematically investigate the adsorption energy and diffusion coefficient of the lithium and sodium ions in monolayer and bulk VS2 for lithium and sodium ion batteries by a density functional theory method. Our calculations show that the VS2 capacity can reach up to 466 mA h g−1. It exhibits a low output voltage of 0.72 and 0.48 V for lithium and sodium ion batteries in the monolayer VS2 as well as an output voltage of 0.88 and 0.6 V in the bulk VS2, respectively. The calculated lithium and sodium ion diffusion coefficients in the bulk VS2 are enhanced by five and seven orders of magnitude compared to the reported bulk MoS2, respectively. Our investigations also reveal that VS2 exhibits better electrochemical performance as an anode in the sodium ion battery than in the lithium ion battery."

However, the current researches of anode for SIBs still face the critical issues of low areal capacity, limited cycle life, and low initial coulombic efficiency for practical application perspective. To solve this issue, a kind of hierarchical 3D carbon‐networks/Fe7S8/graphene (CFG) is designed and synthesized as freestanding anode, which is constructed with Fe7S8 microparticles well‐welded on 3D‐crosslinked carbon‐networks and embedded in highly conductive graphene film, via a facile and scalable synthetic method. The as‐prepared freestanding electrode CFG represents high areal capacity (2.12 mAh cm−2 at 0.25 mA cm−2) and excellent cycle stability of 5000 cycles (0.0095% capacity decay per cycle). The assembled all‐flexible sodium‐ion battery delivers remarkable performance (high areal capacity of 1.42 mAh cm−2 at 0.3 mA cm−2 and superior energy density of 144 Wh kg−1), which are very close to the requirement of practical application.

When tested as an anode material for a sodium‐ion battery, the as‐prepared MoS2/graphene nanosheets exhibit remarkably high rate capability (284 mA h g−1 at 20 A g−1 (≈30C) and 201 mA h g−1 at 50 A g−1 (≈75C)) and excellent cycling stability (capacity retention of 95% after 250 cycles at 0.3 A g−1).

The Bi anode gradually evolves into a porous network in the ether‐based electrolyte during initial cycles, and in the NVP‐CNTs cathode the NVP is cross linked by CNTs to show large exchange current density. These unique features merit the full SIB of Bi//NVP‐CNTs with high Na+ diffusion coefficient and low reaction activation energy, and hence fast Na+ transport and facile redox reaction kinetics. The resultant full SIB presents high power density of 2354.6 W kg−1 and energy density of 150 Wh kg−1 and superior cycling stability in a wide temperature range from −15 to 45 °C.

        "abstract": "Presently, commercialization of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) is still hindered by the relatively poor energy‐storage performance. In addition, low‐temperature (low‐T) Na storage is another principal concern for the wide application of SIBs. Unfortunately, the Na‐transfer kinetics is extremely sluggish at low‐T, as a result, there are few reports on low‐T SIBs. Here, an advanced low‐T sodium‐ion full battery (SIFB) assembled by an anode of 3D Se/graphene composite and a high‐voltage cathode (Na3V2(PO4)2O2F) is developed, exhibiting ultralong lifespan (over even 15 000 cycles, the capacity retention is still up to 86.3% at 1 A g−1), outstanding low‐T energy storage performance (e.g., all values of capacity retention are >75% after 1000 cycles at temperatures from 25 to −25 °C at 0.4 A g−1), and high‐energy/power properties. Such ultralong lifespan signifies that the developed sodium‐ion full battery can be used for longer than 60 years, if batteries charge/discharge once a day and 80% capacity retention is the standard of battery life. As a result, the present study not only promotes the practicability and commercialization of SIBs but also points out the new developing directions of next‐generation energy storage for wider range applications."

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries are attracting increasing interests as a promising alternative to lithium‐ion batteries due to the abundant resource and low cost of sodium. Despite phosphorus (P) has extremely high theoretical capacity of 2595 mAh g−1, its wide application for sodium‐ion battery is highly hampered by its fast capacity fading and low Coulombic efficiency as a result of large volume change upon cycling. Herein, a robust phosphorus anode with long cycle life for sodium‐ion battery via hybridization with functional conductive polymer is presented. To this end, the polyacrylonitrile is first dehydrogenated by sulfur via a facile thermal treatment, forming a conductive main chain embedded with C–S–S moieties. This functional conductive polymer enables the formation of PS bonds between phosphorus and functional conductive matrix, leading to a robust electrode that can accommodate the large volume change upon substantial volume change in cycling. Consequently, this hybrid anode delivers a high capacity of ≈1300 mAh g−1 at a current density of 520 mA g−1 with high Coulombic efficiency (>99%) and good cycling performance (91% capacity retention after 100 cycles)."

The optimized Fe3O4@FeS electrode shows ultralong cycle life and outstanding rate capability. For instance, it remains a capacity retention of 90.8% with a reversible capacity of 169 mAh g-1 after 750 cycles at 0.2 A g-1 and 151 mAh g-1 at a high current density of 2 A g-1, which is about 7.5 times in comparison to the Na-storage capacity of commercial Fe3O4. More importantly, the prepared Fe3O4@FeS also exhibits excellent full-cell performance.

Furthermore, it is also disclosed that such superior electrochemical properties can be attributed to the pseudocapacitive behavior of FeS shell as demonstrated by the kinetics studies as well as the core-shell structure. In view of the large-scale availability of commercial precursor and ease of preparation, this study provide a scalable strategy to develop advanced anode materials for SIBs."

However, the poor rate performance and cyclability of these conversion anodes remain a significant challenge for Na-ion battery applications because most of the conversion anodes suffer from sluggish kinetics and irreversible structural change during cycles. In this paper, we report an Fe2O3 single crystallites/reduced graphene oxide composite (Fe2O3/rGO), where the Fe2O3 single crystallites with a particle size of ∼300 nm were uniformly anchored on the rGO nanosheets, which provide a highly conductive framework to facilitate electron transport and a flexible matrix to buffer the volume change of the material during cycling.

        "abstract": "Improving the battery capacity usually induces a large volume expansion of the electrode, leading to poor reversibility and safety of the battery. Therefore, high specific capacity, fast charging rate, and good reversibility should be balanced in electrode materials. Using first-principles calculations, we systematically explore the InP3 monolayer as an anode material to hold Li (Na) atoms. The adsorption of Li (Na) induces the transformation of the sp2 hybridization of In to the sp3 hybridization, implying a strong binding and fast loading of Li (Na). Furthermore, the alkali-metal–InP3 system shows metallic characteristics which give rise to good electrical conductivity. In addition, Li (Na) diffusion in the zigzag direction is faster than that along the armchair direction. Especially, the Na diffusion barrier along the zigzag direction is as low as 0.06 eV, corresponding to ultrafast charge/discharge capability. Balancing the stability and storage capacity, the specific capacity and average electrode potential of Li (Na) are 258.1 (258.1) mA h g−1 and 0.53 (1.49) V, respectively. Finally, the structure of InP3 is well maintained upon the adsorption of Li (Na) even at the maximum concentration, suggesting its good stability and reversibility. The above-mentioned excellent properties suggest that the InP3 monolayer is a promising anode material for alkali-metal batteries."

Highly compact MoS3 particles infiltrated with carbon nanotubes are prepared via the facile acid precipitation method in ethylene glycol. Compared to crystalline MoS2, the resultant amorphous MoS3 not only exhibits impressive gravimetric performance—featuring excellent specific capacity (≈615 mA h g−1), rate capability (235 mA h g−1 at 20 A g−1), and cycling stability but also shows exceptional volumetric capacity of ≈1000 mA h cm−3 and an areal capacity of >6.0 mA h cm−2 at very high areal loadings of active materials (up to 12 mg cm−2). The experimental results are supported by density functional theory simulations showing that the 1D chains of MoS3 can facilitate the adsorption and diffusion of Na+ ions.

The high capacity is attributed to the short ion and electron diffusion pathway, which enables fast charge transfer and low concentration polarization. The stable cycling performance and high coulombic efficiency (∼100%) of MoS2 /C nanospheres are ascribed to (1) highly reversible conversion reaction of MoS2 during sodiation/desodiation as evidenced by ex-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and (2) the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer in fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) based electrolyte as demonstrated by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements."

        "abstract": "Here we report a room-temperature sodium metal battery, where the sodium initially stored in a Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode is plated, upon charging, onto an aluminum current collector coated with a thin nucleation layer. To maximize the battery performance, conventional sodium-ion anode materials, including non-graphitized carbons and sodium-alloying metals, were evaluated as nucleation layers to facilitate stable electroplating of sodium metal. Among several materials studied, carbon black and bismuth showed the highest sodium plating–stripping coulombic efficiencies in half-cell testing, averaging 99.9% and 99.85%, respectively, over 50 cycles at 0.5 mA cm−2. Building on these findings, anode-free cells with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathodes were assembled in a discharged state, demonstrating energy densities up to 318 W h kg−1 at 0.25 mA cm−2 (∼C/6), a first-cycle coulombic efficiency up to 92%, a stable discharge voltage at 3.35 V, an average round-trip energy efficiency of 98%, and a capacity retention of 82.5% after 100 cycles at 0.5 mA cm−2 (∼C/3). With its unique performance highlighted in this work, the anode-free sodium battery emerges as a low-cost, high-performance option for stationary electric storage."

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have been considered as promising alternatives to the current lithium-ion batteries owing to their low cost and abundant raw material. The major challenge of their practical implementation is the lack of favourable anode material. Spinel Li4Ti5O12 has been regarded as a potential anode material for its superior capability of sodium-ion storage and relatively appropriate operating voltage. However, the low intrinsic ionic and electronic conductivity of spinel Li4Ti5O12 still remains as its major drawback. Herein, carbon-coated Li4Ti5O12 nanoparticles have been synthesized through a solid-state reaction and a chemical vapour deposition method and used as an anode material for sodium-ion battery. The composite structure demonstrates excellent stability and an initial discharge specific capacity of 120.1 mA h g−1, which is maintained at 101.5 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles corresponding to 85% of capacity retention at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. In addition, a full cell was fabricated with carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3 as a positive electrode, which displayed discharge specific capacities of 138.5 mA h g−1 that was maintained at 114.7 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at a current density of 0.05 A g−1, and the capacity retention was 82.8%. The results indicated that the Li4Ti5O12 nanoparticle with a carbon layer shows a promising electrochemical performance as anode materials in sodium-ion batteries."

The interdigital spaces thus formed between individual rods effectively accommodated the volume expansion and contraction of the alloy upon sodiation/desodiation, while additional carbon-coating engineered over these nanorods further suppressed Sn aggregation during extended electrochemical cycling. Due to the unique nanohierarchy of multiple functional layers, the resultant 3D nanoforest of C/Sn/Ni/TMV1cys, binder-free composite electrode already and evenly assembled on a stainless steel current collector, exhibited supreme capacity utilization and cycling stability toward Na-ion storage and release. An initial capacity of 722 mA·h (g Sn)(-1) along with 405 mA·h (g Sn)(-1) retained after 150 deep cycles demonstrates the longest-cycling nano-Sn anode material for Na-ion batteries reported in the literature to date and marks a significant performance improvement for neat Sn material as alloy host for Na-ion chemistry."

The HCNWs used as anode material for Na-ion batteries deliver a high reversible capacity of 251 mAh g(-1) and 82.2% capacity retention over 400 charge-discharge cycles between 1.2 and 0.01 V (vs Na(+)/Na) at a constant current of 50 mA g(-1) (0.2 C). Excellent cycling stability is also observed at an even higher charge-discharge rate. A high reversible capacity of 149 mAh g(-1) also can be obtained at a current rate of 500 mA g(-1) (2C). The good Na-ion insertion property is attributed to the short diffusion distance in the HCNWs and the large interlayer distance (0.37 nm) between the graphitic sheets, which agrees with the interlayered distance predicted by theoretical calculations to enable Na-ion insertion in carbon materials."

        "abstract": "The utilization of renewable energies has become increasingly urgent for the sustainable development of our society. Energy storage systems are essential in order to efficiently use these energies. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) show bright prospect in the application for energy storage markets due to the potential low cost originating from unlimited sources and wide distribution of Na. However, the anode remains a great challenge in the industrialization of SIBs. Hard carbon holds the most promising future among all reported anodes; however, there are still two main shortcomings such as high cost and low initial coulombic efficiency, which limit its application. Here, we report a hard carbon material derived from an abundant and abandoned biomass of corn cobs (HCC) using a simple carbonization method. The HCC shows excellent sodium storage performance with a reversible capacity of ca. 300 mA h g−1, a high initial coulombic efficiency of 86% and good cycling stability. A prototype sodium-ion battery was prepared to prove the application prospect using HCC1300 as the anode and Na0.9[Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48]O2 as the cathode, exhibiting a high energy density of 207 W h kg−1 and a long cycle life. These excellent properties demonstrate that HCC is a potential candidate as an anode material for sodium-ion battery application."

Benefiting from the highly conductive and mechanically robust polyaniline shell, the conductivity and stability of the composite have been significantly improved. As a result, Co3S4@PANI nanotubes demonstrate much better electrochemical performance than bare Co3S4 nanotubes as sodium ion battery anode materials, with a high capacity of 252.5 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at the current density of 200 mA g−1. In contrast, although a specific capacity of the bare Co3S4 nanotubes in the first cycle achieved was 815.3 mA h g−1, it rapidly decayed to 192.9 mA h g−1 at the 20th cycle and further reduced to 58.2 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. Furthermore, Co3S4@PANI nanotubes showed a high discharge capacity of 170.1 mA h g−1 after 400 cycles with a large current density of 4000 mA g−1. The excellent electrochemical properties of Co3S4@PANI nanotubes were ascribed to the combination of Co3S4 and PANI and the stability of the composite structure."

However, the practical application of these materials is usually limited by their low electronic conductivity and serious volume change during the charging-discharging process. Herein, we report the fabrication of 3D-0D graphene-Fe3O4 quantum dot hybrids by a facile one-pot hydrothermal approach as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Fe3O4 quantum dots with an average size of 4.9 nm are anchored on the surface of 3D structured graphene nanosheets homogeneously. Such unique hierarchical structure are advantageous for enlarging the electrode/electrolyte interface area and enhancing the electrochemical activity of the hybrid materials, inhibiting particle aggregation of Fe3O4 and accommodating their volume change during the charging-discharging process as well as enabling fast diffusion of electrons and rapid transfer of electrolyte ions. Consequently, the 3D-0D graphene-Fe3O4 quantum dot hybrids exhibit ultrahigh sodium storage capacity (525 mAh g-1 at 30 mA g-1), outstanding cycling stability (312 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles at 50 mA g-1) and superior rate performance (56 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1)."

K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] cathode can deliver a high capacity of ≈125 mAh g−1 and exceptional cycling stability over 61 000 cycles (≈9 months) if the side reactions from the anode can be prevented. Graphite is a good anode material but is subjected to degradation in traditional carbonate electrolytes. New concentrated electrolytes are developed and evaluated. A stable KIB system is demonstrated by coupling a stable K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] cathode, a prepotassiated graphite anode with a concentrated electrolyte to achieve a high energy density of ≈260 Wh kg−1 (based on the active mass of cathode and anode) and good cycling of over 1000 cycles."

In this work, we construct novel P2-type Na0.7MnO2.05 nanotube/carbon nanotube (NMO/CNT) core/branch composites via a powerful three-step process for sodium ion battery (SIB) applications. P2-type Na0.7MnO2.05 nanotubes of about 500 nm have been, for the first time to our knowledge, fabricated and further modified by cocoon-like CNT branches. The cycling performance is increased significantly with an encouraging capacity retention of 88% at 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles due to enhanced electrochemical kinetics and improved structural stabilization resulting from the CNT cocoon branches. To assess the practical functionality as a full cell, a helical carbon nanofibre (HCNF) anode with capacitive-dominated sodium ion storage is also developed to match with the NMO/CNT cathode. The new-type NMO/CNT//HCNF full cells exhibit encouraging cycle performance with a capacity retention of 71% after 200 cycles at 100 mA g−1 and superior rate performance to the unmodified NMO//HCNF full cells.

The theoretical results reveal that the interlayer-expanded bare, F-, O-, and OH-functionalized Ti3C2 MXenes exhibit low barriers for sodium diffusion and small changes of lattice constant during sodiation. In addition, enlarged interlayer distance enables the stable multilayer adsorption on the bare and O-functionalized Ti3C2 MXenes and therefore significantly enhances their theoretical capacities.

However, the predictable rising cost of lithium raw materials has attracted increasing interest in less expensive rivals, such as sodium-ion battery. In this work, a tin antimony (SnSb) alloy-filled porous carbon nanofiber composite was prepared as a sodium-ion battery anode material by a simple electrospinning method with subsequent thermal treatment. The spinning solution contained antimony tin oxide nanoparticles as the SnSb alloy precursor, polyacrylonitrile as the carbon precursor, and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) as the pore generator. The resultant SnSb@C nanofiber composite formed a continuous conductive network, which was favorable for enhancing its electrochemical performance. The presence of the SnSb alloy significantly increased the energy storage capacity of the composite due to its high theoretical capacity. The porous structure created by the decomposition of the PMMA polymer provided a free space to buffer the volume change of the SnSb alloy during the sodiation–desodiation process. The resultant SnSb@C nanofiber composite exhibited high capacity and a stable rate capability, and it was demonstrated to be a promising anode candidate for sodium-ion batteries."

Transmission electron microscope images confirm that SnSb nanoparticles with an average size of about 20-30 nm are uniformly dispersed on the RGO surfaces. When they were used as anodes for rechargeable sodium (Na)-ion batteries, these as-synthesized RGO-SnSb nanocomposite anodes delivered a high initial reversible capacity of 407 mAh g(-1), stable cyclic retention for more than 80 cycles and excellent cycle stability at ultra high charge/discharge rates up to 30C. The significantly improved performance of the synthesized RGO-SnSb nanocomposites as Na-ion battery anodes can be attributed to the synergetic effects of RGO-based flexible framework and the nanoscale dimension of the SnSb alloy particles (<30 nm). Nanosized intermetallic SnSb compounds can exhibit improved structural stability and conductivity during charge and discharge reactions compared to the corresponding individuals (Sn and Sb particles). In the meantime, RGO sheets can tightly anchor SnSb alloy particles on the surfaces, which can not only effectively suppress the agglomeration of SnSb particles but also maintain excellent electronic conduction. Furthermore, the mechanical flexibility of the RGO phase can accommodate the volume expansion and contraction of SnSb particles during the prolonged cycling, therefore, improve the electrode integrity mechanically and electronically. All of these contribute to the electrochemical performance improvements of the RGO-SnSb nanocomposite-based electrodes in rechargeable Na-ion batteries."

        "abstract": "We created a unique sodium ion battery (NIB, SIB) cathode based on selenium in cellulose-derived carbon nanosheets (CCNs), termed Se-CCN. The elastically compliant two-dimensional CCN host incorporates a high mass loading of amorphous Se (53 wt%), which is primarily impregnated into 1 cm3 g−1 nanopores. The results in facile sodiation kinetics due to short solid-state diffusion distances and a large charge transfer area of the nanosheets were established. The architecture also leads to an intrinsic resistance to polyselenide shuttle and to disintegration/coarsening. As a Na half-cell, the Se-CCN cathode delivers a reversible capacity of 613 mA h g−1 with 88% retention over 500 cycles. The exceptional stability is achieved by using a standard electrolyte (1 M NaClO4 EC-DMC) without secondary additives or high salt concentrations. The rate capability is also superb, achieving 300 mA h g−1 at 10C. Compared to recent state-of-the-art literature, the Se-CCN is the most cyclically stable and offers the highest rate performance. As a Se–Na battery, the system achieves 992 W h kg−1 at 68 W kg−1 and 384 W h kg−1 at 10144 W kg−1 (by active mass in a cathode). We are the first to fabricate and test a Se-based full NIB, which is based on Se-CCN coupled to a Na intercalating pseudographitic carbon (PGC) anode. It is demonstrated that the PGC anode increases its structural order in addition to dilating as a result of Na intercalation at voltages below 0.2 V vs. Na/Na+. The {110} Na reflections are distinctly absent from the XRD patterns of PGC sodiated down to 0.001 V, indicating that the Na metal pore filling is not significant for pseudographitic carbons. The battery delivers highly promising Ragone chart characteristics, for example yielding 203 and 50 W h kg−1 at 70 and 14000 W kg−1 (via total material mass in the anode and cathode)."

Science, this issue p. 838 Optimized electrochemical conditions reduce a wide range of aromatic substrates more safely than sodium dissolved in ammonia.

As a sodium ion battery anode, ZNP/C-600 shows a high capacity of 361 mA h g−1 over 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1, and an ultrahigh capacity of 227 mA h g−1 is sustained after 1000 cycles at 2 A g−1. When employed as a potassium ion battery anode, ZNP/C-600 exhibits a high capacity of 200 mA h g−1 over 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1, and a stable capacity of 145 mA h g−1 over 300 cycles at 0.5 A g−1. Qualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that capacitance and diffusion mechanisms account for the superior Na/K storage performance, in which the capacitance plays a significant role."

        "abstract": "Water‐in‐salt (WiS) electrolytes provide a new pathway to widen the electrochemical window of aqueous electrolytes. However, their formulation strongly depends on the solubility of the chosen salts, imposing a stringent restriction on the number of possible WiS systems. This issue becomes more severe for aqueous Na‐ion batteries (ANIBs) owing to the relatively lower solubility of sodium salts compared to its alkaline cousins (Li, K, and Cs). A new class of the inert‐cation‐assisted WiS (IC‐WiS) electrolytes containing the tetraethylammonium (TEA+) inert cation is reported. The Na IC‐WiS electrolyte at a superhigh concentration of 31 mol kg–1 exhibits a wide electrochemical window of 3.3 V, suppresses transition metal dissolution from the cathode, and ensures singular intercalation of Na into both cathode and anode electrodes during cycling, which is often problematic in mixed alkali cation systems such as K–Na and Li–Na. Owing to these unique advantages of the IC‐WiS electrolyte, the NaTiOPO4 anode and Prussian blue analog Na1.88Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.97·1.35H2O cathode can be coupled to construct a full ANIB, delivering an average voltage of 1.74 V and a high energy density of 71 Wh kg−1 with a capacity retention of 90% after 200 cycles at 0.25C and of 76% over 800 cycles at 1C."

        "abstract": "attracted much attention due to low cost, large resource availability, and similar insertion chemistry with lithium ions. [ 4–6 ] Inspired by Li-ion battery chemistry, a large number of cathode materials such as transitional metal oxides were investigated in Na-ion batteries. [ 7,8 ] However, there are not as many attempts on improving electrochemical performance of anode materials as that for cathode materials. Up to now, proposed anode materials include carbonaceous materials, [ 9 ] Na-alloys (Sn, Sb) [ 10,11 ] and binary compounds (metal oxides, metal sulfi des). [ 12–14 ] Due to the similar chemistry to Li-ion batteries, carbonaceous anode materials are widely used in Na-ion batteries. [ 15 ] Recent reports on carbon nanosheet derived from peat moss [ 16 ] and hollow carbon nanowires [ 17 ] demonstrate a reversible sodium-ion intercalation/deintercalation with specifi c capacities in the range of 200–300 mAh g −1 . Some metals (Sn, Sb) can alloy with Na exhibiting high capacities of 400–600 mAh g −1 . [ 10,11 ] However, it is very diffi cult to maintain the high capacity during charge/discharge cycles due to large volume change. To this regard, anode materials with high capacity and superior cycling stability are urgently needed for Na-ion batteries. Molybdenum disulfi de (MoS 2 ) is a promising anode for high performance sodium-ion batteries due to high specifi c capacity, abundance, and low cost. However, poor cycling stability, low rate capability and unclear electrochemical reaction mechanism are the main challenges for MoS 2 anode in Na-ion batteries. In this study, molybdenum disulfi de/carbon (MoS 2 /C) nanospheres are fabricated and used for Na-ion battery anodes. MoS 2 /C nanospheres deliver a reversible capacity of 520 mAh g −1 at 0.1 C and maintain at 400 mAh g −1 for 300 cycles at a high current density of 1 C, demonstrating the best cycling performance of MoS 2 for Na-ion batteries to date. The high capacity is attributed to the short ion and electron diffusion pathway, which enables fast charge transfer and low concentration polarization. The stable cycling performance and high coulombic effi ciency (∼100%) of MoS 2 /C nanospheres are ascribed to (1) highly reversible conversion reaction of MoS 2 during sodiation/desodiation as evidenced by ex-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and (2) the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer in fl uoroethylene carbonate (FEC) based electrolyte as demonstrated by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements.

        "abstract": "Despite the high specific capacity and low redox potential of alkali metals, their practical application as anodes is still limited by the inherent dendrite‐growth problem. The fusible sodium–potassium (Na–K) liquid metal alloy is an alternative that detours this drawback, but the fundamental understanding of charge transport in this binary electroactive alloy anode remains elusive. Here, comprehensive characterization, accompanied with density function theory (DFT) calculations, jointly expound the Na–K anode‐based battery working mechanism. With the organic cathode sodium rhodizonate dibasic (SR) that has negligible selectivity toward cations, the charge carrier is screened by electrolytes due to the selective ionic pathways in the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Stable cycling for this Na–K/SR battery is achieved with capacity retention per cycle to be 99.88% as a sodium‐ion battery (SIB) and 99.70% as a potassium‐ion battery (PIB) for over 100 cycles. Benefitting from the flexibility of the liquid metal and the specially designed carbon nanofiber (CNF)/SR layer‐by‐layer cathode, a flexible dendrite‐free alkali‐ion battery is achieved with an ultrahigh areal capacity of 2.1 mAh cm−2. Computation‐guided materials selection, characterization‐supported mechanistic understanding, and self‐validating battery performance collectively promise the prospect of a high‐performance, dendrite‐free, and versatile organic‐based liquid metal battery."

In this review, the recent progress and remaining challenges of conversion reactions for LIBs and SIBs are discussed, covering an overview about the different synthesis methods, morphological characteristics, as well as their electrochemical performance.

Herein, a 3D Ag@C natrophilic substrate prepared by a facile thermal evaporation deposition method, which can be employed as a much safer \"anode-free\" SMA, is reported. Initially, there is no bulk sodium on the Ag@C substrate in the assembled SIBs. Upon charging, sodium will be uniformly deposited onto the Ag@C substrate and afterwards functions as a real SMA, thus inheriting the intrinsic merits of SMA and enhancing safety simultaneously. While cycling, the as-synthesized substrate demonstrates superior sodium plating/stripping cycling stability at 1, 2 and 3 mA cm-2 with a capacity of 2 mAh cm-2 . Theoretical simulations reveal that Na ions prefer to bind with Ag and form a Na-Ag network, thus clearly revealing uniform sodium deposition on the Ag@C substrate. More importantly, a full battery based on Ag@C and Prussian white with impressive Coulomb efficiency (CE), high rate capability (from 0.1 C to 5 C) and long-term cycling life is illustrated for the first time, thus making Ag@C feasible for the establishment of \"anode-free\" SIBs with reduced cost, high gravimetric/volumetric energy density and enhanced safety."

Current efforts in modifying electrolytes to optimize their interfacial compatibility with electrodes, leading to longer battery lifetimes and greater safety, are described. The advanced characterization techniques used to investigate the properties of electrolytes and interfaces are introduced, and the reaction processes and degradation mechanisms of SIBs are revealed.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are a recent development being promoted repeatedly as an economically promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, only one detailed study about material costs has yet been published for this battery type. This paper presents the first detailed economic assessment of 18,650-type SIB cells with a layered oxide cathode and a hard carbon anode, based on existing datasheets for pre-commercial battery cells. The results are compared with those of competing LIB cells, that is, with lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxide cathodes (NMC) and with lithium-iron-phosphate cathodes (LFP). A sensitivity analysis further evaluates the influence of varying raw material prices on the results. For the SIB, a cell price of 223 €/kWh is obtained, compared to 229 €/kWh for the LFP and 168 €/kWh for the NMC batteries. The main contributor to the price of the SIB cells are the material costs, above all the cathode and anode active materials. For this reason, the amount of cathode active material (e.g., coating thickness) in addition to potential fluctuations in the raw material prices have a considerable effect on the price per kWh of storage capacity. Regarding the anode, the precursor material costs have a significant influence on the hard carbon cost, and thus on the final price of the SIB cell. Organic wastes and fossil coke precursor materials have the potential of yielding hard carbon at very competitive costs. In addition, cost reductions in comparison with LIBs are achieved for the current collectors, since SIBs also allow the use of aluminum instead of copper on the anode side. For the electrolyte, the substitution of lithium with sodium leads to only a marginal cost decrease from 16.1 to 15.8 €/L, hardly noticeable in the final cell price. On the other hand, the achievable energy density is fundamental. While it seems difficult to achieve the same price per kWh as high energy density NMC LIBs, the SIB could be a promising substitute for LFP cells in stationary applications, if it also becomes competitive with LFP cells in terms of safety and cycle life."

However, Bi suffers from large volume expansion during sodiation, leading to poor electrochemical performance. Construction nanostructure with sufficient void space to accommodate the volume change has been proven effective for achieving prolonged cycling stability. But the excessive void space will definitely decrease the volumetric energy density of battery. Herein, we design an optimized Bi@Void@C nanospheres (Bi@Void@C-2) with yolk-shell structure that exhibits the best cycling performance and enhanced volumetric energy density. The optimized void space could not only buffer the volume change of the Bi nanosphere, but also could keep the high volumetric energy density of battery. The Bi@Void@C-2 shows an excellent rate capacity of 173 mAh g-1 at ultra-high current density of 100 A g-1 and long-cycle life (198 mAh g-1 at 20A g-1 over 10000 cycles). The origin of the superior performance is achieved through in-depth fundamental studies during battery operation using in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and in-situ transmission electron microscope (TEM), complemented by theoretical calculations and ex-situ TEM observation. Our rational design provides insights for anode materials with large volume variation, especially for conversion type and alloying type mechanism materials for batteries (i.e. Li-ion batteries, Na-ion batteries)."

Nevertheless, their rapid development is still greatly hampered by some typical constraints including low coulombic efficiency, large volume changes and severe particle agglomeration and pulverization during the charge-discharge process. Here, we fabricate a few-layer MoSe2 confined within a ZnSe-C hollow porous sphere nanocomposite through a simple self-assembly strategy followed by selenization, which efficiently circumvents these problems. The fabricated ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode demonstrates diverse advantages, including the existence of a few-layer structure, an in situ porous carbon matrix, multicomponent coordination and excellent pseudocapacitive behavior. When used as an anode material, it displays extraordinarily attractive electrochemical performance for both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The reversible capacity of ZnSe/MoSe2@C for LIBs reaches as high as 1051 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 (150 cycles). A long-term high-rate cycling test reveals an excellent stability of 524 mA h g-1 at 4 A g-1 after 600 cycles. In addition, for SIBs, ZnSe/MoSe2@C also manifests a high initial coulombic efficiency of 89% at 0.2 A g-1 and a remarkable reversible capacity of 381 mA h g-1 at a high current density of 4 A g-1 even after 250 cycles with negligible capacity loss. This is one of the best performances of ZnSe-based anode materials for SIBs reported so far. The regulation strategy reported in the present work is expected to offer new insights into the fabrication of high performance anode materials for SIBs."

It is shown that a large irreversible capacity of 60 mAh g−1 is replenished and 20% increase of the first‐cycle Coulombic efficiency is achieved for a hard carbon anode using this presodiation strategy, and the energy density of a Na0.9[Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48]O2||carbon full cell is increased from 141 to 240 Wh kg−1 by using the presodiated carbon anode.

        "abstract": "Sodium‐based energy storage technologies are potential candidates for large‐scale grid applications owing to the earth abundance and low cost of sodium resources. Transition metal phosphides, e.g. MoP, are promising anode materials for sodium‐ion storage, while their detailed reaction mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Herein, the sodium‐ion storage mechanism of hexagonal MoP is systematically investigated through experimental characterizations, density functional theory calculations, and kinetics analysis. Briefly, it is found that the naturally covered surface amorphous molybdenum oxides layers on the MoP grains undergo a faradaic redox reaction during sodiation and desodiation, while the inner crystalline MoP remains unchanged. Remarkably, the MoP anode exhibits a pseudocapacitive‐dominated behavior, enabling the high‐rate sodium storage performance. By coupling the pseudocapacitive anode with a high‐rate‐battery‐type Na3V2O2(PO4)2F@rGO cathode, a novel sodium‐ion full cell delivers a high energy density of 157 Wh kg−1 at 97 W kg−1 and even 52 Wh kg−1 at 9316 W kg−1. These findings present the deep understanding of the sodium‐ion storage mechanism in hexagonal MoP and offer a potential route for the design of high‐rate sodium‐ion storage materials and devices."

        "abstract": "Most active materials for sodium-ion batteries suffer from the problem of low energy efficiency in the first cycle due to the loss of active sodium-ions consumed for the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI). To make up for the lost sodium-ion, pre-sodiation treatments have been applied, which are effective ways to mitigate the low initial efficiency. Here, we developed a direct-contact method to achieve the pre-sodiation for cathode and anode electrodes and demonstrated the enhanced coulombic efficiency of the first cycle with improved cyclability and reversible capacity. Moreover, we proved the formation of a thick passivation layer at the cathode-electrolyte interface during the pre-sodiation process; this contributes to the improved cycle stability by preventing the dissolution of the active material and its deposition on the anode surface. The direct-contact method is a simple and cost-effective way to complete pre-sodiation, and this simple process will be widely applicable for practical battery manufacturing."

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries, representative members of the post‐lithium‐battery club, are very attractive and promising for large‐scale energy storage applications. The increasing technological improvements in sodium‐ion batteries (Na‐ion batteries) are being driven by the demand for Na‐based electrode materials that are resource‐abundant, cost‐effective, and long lasting. Polyanion‐type compounds are among the most promising electrode materials for Na‐ion batteries due to their stability, safety, and suitable operating voltages. The most representative polyanion‐type electrode materials are Na3V2(PO4)3 and NaTi2(PO4)3 for Na‐based cathode and anode materials, respectively. Both show superior electrochemical properties and attractive prospects in terms of their development and application in Na‐ion batteries. Carbonophosphate Na3MnCO3PO4 and amorphous FePO4 have also recently emerged and are contributing to further developing the research scope of polyanion‐type Na‐ion batteries. However, the typical low conductivity and relatively low capacity performance of such materials still restrict their development. This paper presents a brief review of the research progress of polyanion‐type electrode materials for Na‐ion batteries, summarizing recent accomplishments, highlighting emerging strategies, and discussing the remaining challenges of such systems."

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted considerable attention due to the intrinsic safety and high abundance of sodium. However, the lack of high-performance anode materials becomes a main obstacle for the development of SIBs. Here, we identify an ideal anode material, a metallic TiC3 monolayer with not only remarkably high storage capacity of 1278 mA h g-1 but also low barrier energy and open-circuit voltage, through first-principles swarm-intelligence structure calculations. TiC3 still keeps metallic after adsorbing two-layer Na atoms, ensuring good electrical conductivity during the battery cycle. Besides, high melting point and superior dynamical stability are in favor of practical application. Its excellent performance can be mainly attributed to the presence of an unusual n-biphenyl unit in the TiC3 monolayer. High cohesive energy, originating from multibonding coexistence (e.g., covalent, ionic, and metal bonds) in the TiC3 monolayer, provides strong feasibility for experimental synthesis. In comparison with TiC3, functionalized TiC3 with oxygen shows a higher storage capacity; meanwhile, it keeps nearly the same barrier energy. This is in sharp contrast with metal-rich MXenes. These intriguing properties make the TiC3 monolayer a promising anode material for SIBs."

        "abstract": "Carbon sheets with 3D architectures, large graphitic interlayer spacing, and high electrical conductivity are highly expected to be an ideal anode material for sodium‐ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs). Pursuing a simple synthesis methodology and advancing it from the laboratory to industry is of great importance. In this study, a new approach is presented to prepare 3D framework carbon (3DFC) with the above integrated advantages by a direct calcination of sodium citrate without aid of any additional carbon source, template, or catalyst. The first‐principle calculations verify that the large interlayer spacing and the curvature structure of 3DFC facilitate the sodium ion insertion/extraction. As a consequence, the optimal 3DFC sample exhibits high reversible capacity as well as excellent rate and cycling performance. On this basis, a dual‐carbon SIHC is fabricated by employing 3DFC as battery‐type anode and 3DFC‐derived nanoporous carbon as capacitor‐type cathode. It is able to deliver high energy‐ and power‐density feature as well as outstanding long‐term cycling stability in the potential range of 0–4.0 V. This study may open an avenue for developing high‐performance carbon electrode materials and pushes the practical applications of SIHCs a decisive step forward."

        "abstract": "Achieving high‐performance Na‐ion capacitors (NICs) has the particular challenge of matching both capacity and kinetics between the anode and cathode. Here a high‐power NIC full device constructed from 2D metal–organic framework (MOFs) array is reported as the reactive template. The MOF array is converted to N‐doped mesoporous carbon nanosheets (mp‐CNSs), which are then uniformly encapsulated with VO2 and Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) nanoparticles as the electroactive materials. By this method, the high‐power performance of the battery materials is enabled to be enhanced significantly. It is discovered that such hybrid NVP@mp‐CNSs array can render ultrahigh rate capability (up to 200 C, equivalent to discharge within 18 s) and superior cycle performance, which outperforms all NVP‐based Na‐ion battery cathodes reported so far. A quasi‐solid‐state flexible NIC based on the NVP@mp‐CNSs cathode and the VO2@mp‐CNSs anode is further assembled. This hybrid NIC device delivers both high energy density and power density as well as a good cycle stability (78% retention after 2000 cycles at 1 A g−1).

        "abstract": "Inspired by the great success of graphite in lithium‐ion batteries, anode materials that undergo an intercalation mechanism are considered to provide stable and reversible electrochemical sodium‐ion storage for sodium‐ion battery (SIB) applications. Though MoS2 is a promising 2D material for SIBs, it suffers from deformation of its layered structure during repeated intercalation of Na+, resulting in undesirable electrochemical behaviors. In this study, vertically oriented MoS2 on nitrogenous reduced graphene oxide sheets (VO‐MoS2/N‐RGO) is presented with designed spatial geometries, including sheet density and height, which can deliver a remarkably high reversible capacity of 255 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 and 245 mA h g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, with a total fluctuation of 5.35% over 1300 cycles. These results are superior to those obtained with well‐developed hard carbon structures. Furthermore, a SIB full cell composed of the optimized VO‐MoS2/N‐RGO anode and a Na2V3(PO4)3 cathode reaches a specific capacity of 262 mA h g−1 (based on the anode mass) during 50 cycles, with an operated voltage range of 2.4 V, demonstrating the potentially rewarding SIB performance, which is useful for further battery development."

        "abstract": "Metallic tin has been considered as one of the most promising anode materials both for lithium (LIBs) and sodium ion battery (NIBs) because of a high theoretical capacity and an appropriate low discharge potential. However, Sn anodes suffer from a rapid capacity fading during cycling due to pulverization induced by severe volume changes. Here we innovatively synthesized pipe-wire TiO2-Sn@carbon nanofibers (TiO2-Sn@CNFs) via electrospinning and atomic layer deposition to suppress pulverization-induced capacity decay. In pipe-wire TiO2-Sn@CNFs paper, nano-Sn is uniformly dispersed in carbon nanofibers, which not only act as a buffer material to prevent pulverization, but also serve as a conductive matrix. In addition, TiO2 pipe as the protection shell outside of Sn@carbon nanofibers can restrain the volume variation to prevent Sn from aggregation and pulverization during cycling, thus increasing the Coulombic efficiency. The pipe-wire TiO2-Sn@CNFs show excellent electrochemical performance as anodes for both LIBs and NIBs. It exhibits a high and stable capacity of 643 mA h/g at 200 mA/g after 1100 cycles in LIBs and 413 mA h/g at 100 mA/g after 400 cycles in NIBs. These results would shed light on the practical application of Sn-based materials as a high capacity electrode with good cycling stability for next-generation LIBs and NIBs."

Furthermore, the pseudocapacitance contributions of the NGQDs-WS2/3DCF nanoarchitecture are quantified by an in-depth kinetics analysis, which provides a better understanding of the excellent electrochemical performances. Remarkably, a cable-shaped flexible full SIB was also demonstrated using NGQDs-WS2/3DCF as the anode electrode, which exhibits high capacity and excellent flexibility.

However, the development of high‐performance anode materials is a bottleneck of SIBs advancement. In this work, Sb2Se3 nanorods uniformly wrapped by reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as a promising anode material for SIBs are reported. The results show that such Sb2Se3/rGO hybrid anode yields a high reversible mass‐specific energy capacity of 682, 448, and 386 mAh g−1 at a rate of 0.1, 1.0, and 2.0 A g−1, respectively, and sustains at least 500 stable cycles at a rate of 1.0 A g−1 with an average mass‐specific energy capacity of 417 mAh g−1 and capacity retention of 90.2%. In situ X‐ray diffraction study on a live SIB cell reveals that the observed high performance is a result of the combined Na+ intercalation, conversion reaction between Na+ and Se, and alloying reaction between Na+ and Sb. The presence of rGO also plays a key role in achieving high rate capacity and cycle stability by providing good electrical conductivity, tolerant accommodation to volume change, and strong electron interactions to the base Sb2Se3 anode."

        "abstract": "The main challenge associated with sodium-ion battery (SIB) anodes is a search for novel candidate materials with high capacity and excellent rate capability. The most commonly used and effective route for graphene-based anode design is the introduction of in-plane “hole” defects via nitrogen-doping; this creates a spacious reservoir for storing more energy. Inspired by mountains in nature, herein, we propose another way – the introduction of blistering in graphene instead of making “holes”; this facilitates adsorbing/inserting more Na+ ions. In order to properly answer the key question: ““protrusions” or “holes” in graphene, which is better for sodium ion storage?”, two types of anode materials with a similar doping level were designed: a phosphorus-doped graphene (GP, with protrusions) and a nitrogen-doped graphene (GN, with holes). As compared with GN, the GP anode perfectly satisfies all the desired criteria: it reveals an ultrahigh capacity (374 mA h g−1 after 120 cycles at 25 mA g−1) comparable to the best graphite anodes in a standard Li-ion battery (∼372 mA h g−1), and exhibits an excellent rate capability (210 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1). In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were utilized to uncover the origin of the enhanced electrochemical activity of “protrusions” compared to “holes” in SIBs, down to the atomic scale. The introduction of protrusions through P-doping into graphene is envisaged to be a novel effective way to enhance the capacity and rate performance of SIBs."

        "abstract": "We have systematically changed the number of atomic layers stacked in 2D SnO nanosheet anodes and studied their sodium ion battery (SIB) performance. The results indicate that as the number of atomic SnO layers in a sheet decreases, both the capacity and cycling stability of the Na ion battery improve. The thinnest SnO nanosheet anodes (two to six SnO monolayers) exhibited the best performance. Specifically, an initial discharge and charge capacity of 1072 and 848 mAh g-1 were observed, respectively, at 0.1 A g-1. In addition, an impressive reversible capacity of 665 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 and 452 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 1.0 A g-1 was observed, with excellent rate performance. As the average number of atomic layers in the anode sheets increased, the battery performance degraded significantly. For example, for the anode sheets with 10-20 atomic layers, only a reversible capacity of 389 mAh g-1 could be obtained after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1. Density functional theory calculations coupled with experimental results were used to elucidate the sodiation mechanism of the SnO nanosheets. This systematic study of monolayer-dependent physical and electrochemical properties of 2D anodes shows a promising pathway to engineering and mitigating volume changes in 2D anode materials for sodium ion batteries. It also demonstrates that ultrathin SnO nanosheets are promising SIB anode materials with high specific capacity, stable cyclability, and excellent rate performance."

However, their poor cycling stability and rate performance hinder their further development. To avoid these issues, In2S3 into Sb2S3 is introduced to improve its electrochemical properties by optimizing its crystal structure and sodium storage mechanism. A heterostructure composed of In2S3 and Sb2S3 shows a unique morphology of formicary microspheres, which provide abundant channels for fast transfer of sodium ions, large surface area for a high pseudocapacitance effect, and enough voids to relieve volume expansion. A sodium‐ion battery containing the bimetallic sulfide anode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 400 mA h g−1 and long cycle life of about 1000 cycles. Similarly, a high capacity of ≈610 mA h g−1 is achieved for a lithium‐ion battery containing the anode. During sodiation/desodiation, the synergistic effect of In2S3 and Sb2S3 enhances electronic conductivity and supports the host structure, preventing collapse. The cycling performance and rate performance of the In2S3–Sb2S3 anode are further improved by wrapping the electrode with carbon nanotubes.

Therefore, as a result of its structure features, CPNW anode demonstrates highly stable cycling ability with an ≈70% retention in capacity at the 260th cycle, whereas most reported metal phosphides have limited cycle numbers ranged between 30 and 150. Besides, the reaction mechanism between Cu3P and Na is investigated by examining the intermediate products at different charge/discharge stages using ex situ X‐ray diffraction measurements. Furthermore, to explore the practical application of CPNW anode, a pouch‐type Na+ full cell consisting of CPNW anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode is assembled and characterized. As a demonstration, a 10 cm × 10 cm light‐emmiting diode (LED) screen is successfully powered by the Na+ full cell."

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries are emerging as potential alternatives to lithium-ion batteries. This study presents a prospective life cycle assessment for the production of a sodium-ion battery with a layered transition metal oxide as a positive electrode material and hard carbon as a negative electrode material on the battery component level. The complete and transparent inventory data are disclosed, which can easily be used as a basis for future environmental assessments. Na-ion batteries are found to be promising under environmental aspects, showing, per kWh of storage capacity, environmental impacts at the lower end of the range published for current Li-ion batteries. Still significant improvement potential is given, especially by reducing the environmental impacts associated with the hard carbon production for the anode and by reducing the nickel content in the cathode active material. For the hard carbons, the use of organic waste can be considered to be promising in this regard. Nevertheless, when looking at the energy storage capacity over lifetime, achieving a high cycle life and good charge–discharge efficiency is fundamental. This represents the main challenge especially when competing with LFP–LTO type Li-Ion batteries, which already show extraordinarily long lifetimes."

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries are emerging as an alternative energy storage system for lithium-ion batteries because of the abundance and low cost of sodium. Various carbon-based anode materials have been investigated in order to improve sodium battery performance and cycle life. In this study, because of its abundance and high porosity, pistachio shell was selected as the primary carbon source, and carbonization temperatures ranged from 700 to 1500 °C. Pistachio shell carbonized at 1000 °C resulted in a highly amorphous structure with specific surface area 760.9 m2 g–1 and stable cycle performance (225 mA h g–1 at 10 mA g–1). Our initial results obtained from carbonized pistachio shell suggest that sufficient electrochemical performance may be obtained from biowaste materials, offering new pathways for sustainable electro-mobility and other battery applications."

        "abstract": "Energy and climate concerns have made the need for research towards electrical energy storage. In this context, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted significant attention lately. Sodium is an abundant resource that is low cost and safe which makes it an attractive alternative to lithium. Its chemical properties are similar to that of Li which makes the transition into using Na chemistry for ion battery systems feasible. This review focuses on the latest progress in both cathode and anode materials for SIBs. It also details research in binders and additives and their effects on the SIB system. It further highlights the optimization of organic electrolytes and ionic liquid based electrolytes for utilization in SIBs. The mechanisms of sodium ion storage, transport, and solid electrolyte interphase formation are also discussed to better understand the behavior of ions and battery materials during de/intercalation. Finally, personal perspectives on outlook and major challenges ahead for SIBs are offered. These comprehensive and in-depth discussions along with proposed directions can enlighten ideas and offer avenues in the rational design of durable and high performance SIBs in the near future."

However, SIBs face challenges of low specific energy, unsatisfactory rate capability, and short cycling life caused by the heavy mass and large radius of Na+ ions. Therefore, developing promising host materials with the ability of fast, stable, and efficient sodium-ion insertion/extraction is key to promoting SIBs. Furthermore, the optimization of the electrolyte, the matching of cathode and anode materials, and the construction of sodium-ion full batteries with high-performance, high-safety, and low cost are urgently needed in order to make SIBs commercially available. In this review, we summarize the up-to-date research progress and insights on key materials (including cathode, anode, and electrolyte) for Na storage and some representative Na-ion full battery configurations will also be emphatically described. This should shed light on the fundamental research and practical applications of sodium-ion batteries."

The use of a moderate drying temperature (250°C) led to mesoporous characteristics with enhanced electrochemical activity, as confirmed by electron microscopy and N2 adsorption studies. The dimensions of the sheets ranged from nanometres to micrometres and these sheets were entangled with each other. These morphological features of rGO tend to facilitate the movement of guest ions larger than Li+. Impressive electrochemical properties were achieved with the rGO electrodes using various charge-transfer ions, such as Li+, Na+ and K+, along with high porosity. Notably, the feasibility of this system as the carbonaceous anode material for sodium battery systems is demonstrated. Furthermore, the results also suggest that the high-rate capability of the present rGO electrode can pave the way for improving the full cell characteristics, especially for preventing the potential drop in sodium-ion batteries and potassium-ion batteries, which are expected to replace the lithium-ion battery system"

We show that calcium-mediated \"egg-box\" electrostatic cross-linking of alginate improves toughness, resilience, electrolyte desolvation of the alginate binder as a Si-binder for LIBs.

Herein a room‐temperature liquid alloy system is proposed as a possible solution for its self‐recovery property. Full extraction of alkali metal ions from the ternary alloy brings it back to the binary liquid eutectic, and thus enables a self‐healing process of the cracked or pulverized structure during cycling. A half‐cell discharge specific capacity of up to 706.0 mAh g−1 in lithium‐ion battery and 222.3 mAh g−1 for sodium‐ion battery can be delivered at 0.1C; at a high rate of 5C, a sizable capacity of over 400 mAh g−1 for Li and 60 mAh g−1 for Na could be retained. Li and Na ion full cells with considerable stability are demonstrated when pairing liquid metal with typical cathode materials, LiFePO4, and P2‐Na2/3[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2.

        "abstract": "Metal‐ion capacitors are being widely studied to reach a balance between power and energy output by combining the merits of conventional batteries and capacitors. The main challenge for Na‐ion capacitors is that the battery‐type anode usually has unsatisfactory power density and long‐term stability since most Na host materials have a poor kinetic and structural stability. Herein, asymmetric hollow bowl‐like carbon (HBC) materials are rationally designed and fabricated through an in situ hard‐template approach. The formation originates from a subtle control of capillary force and the mechanical strength of the carbon shell. The HBCs possess abundant mesopores, high volumes of accessible surface area as well as an open macropore network. As a 3D host, MoSe2 nanocrystals are anchored onto the HBC matrix by a solid‐phase reaction. The obtained MoSe2@HBC nanobowl electrode exhibits pseudocapacitive sodium storage with fast kinetics, improved capacity at high currents, and cycle stability, which is also supported by DFT calculations. Sodium ion capacitor full cells are fabricated using the two bowl‐like architectures (MoSe2@HBC as the anode and HBC as the cathode), which deliver high energy and power densities, long cycle life, and a comparably low self‐discharge rate. Moreover, application of the HBC in a zinc‐ion capacitor (ZIC) is also demonstrated."

        "abstract": "In this critical Review we focus on the evolution of the hybrid ion capacitor (HIC) from its early embodiments to its modern form, focusing on the key outstanding scientific and technological questions that necessitate further in-depth study. It may be argued that HICs began as aqueous systems, based on a Faradaic oxide positive electrode (e.g., Co3O4, RuO x) and an activated carbon ion-adsorption negative electrode. In these early embodiments HICs were meant to compete directly with electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs), rather than with the much higher energy secondary batteries. The HIC design then evolved to be based on a wide voltage (∼4.2 V) carbonate-based battery electrolyte, using an insertion titanium oxide compound anode (Li4Ti5O12, Li xTi5O12) versus a Li ion adsorption porous carbon cathode. The modern Na and Li architectures contain a diverse range of nanostructured materials in both electrodes, including TiO2, Li7Ti5O12, Li4Ti5O12, Na6LiTi5O12, Na2Ti3O7, graphene, hard carbon, soft carbon, graphite, carbon nanosheets, pseudocapacitor T-Nb2O5, V2O5, MXene, conversion compounds MoS2, VN, MnO, and Fe2O3/Fe3O4, cathodes based on Na3V2(PO4)3, NaTi2(PO4)3, sodium super ionic conductor (NASICON), etc. The Ragone chart characteristics of HIC devices critically depend on their anode-cathode architectures. Combining electrodes with the flattest capacity versus voltage characteristics, and the largest total voltage window, yields superior energy. Unfortunately \"flat voltage\" materials undergo significant volume expansion/contraction during cycling and are frequently lifetime limited. Overall more research on HIC cathodes is needed; apart from high surface area carbon, very few positive electrodes demonstrate the necessary 10 000 or 100 000 plus cycle life. It remains to be determined whether its lithium ion capacitors (LICs) or sodium ion capacitors (NICs) are superior in terms of energy-power and cyclability. We discuss unresolved issues, including poorly understood fast-charge storage mechanisms, prelithiation and presodiation, solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formation, and high-rate metal plating."

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) have the potential to be practically applied in large‐scale energy storage markets. The rapid progress of SIBs research is primarily focused on electrodes, while electrolytes attract less attention. Indeed, the improvement of electrode performance is arguably correlated with the electrolyte optimization. In conventional lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), ether‐based electrolytes are historically less practical owing to the insufficient passivation of both anodes and cathodes. As an important class of aprotic electrolytes, ethers have revived with the emerging lithium‐sulfur and lithium‐oxygen batteries in recent years, and are even booming in the wave of SIBs. Ether‐based electrolytes are unique to enabling these new battery chemistries in terms of producing stable ternary graphite intercalation compounds, modifying anode solid electrolyte interphases, reducing the solubility of intermediates, and decreasing polarization. Better still, ether‐based electrolytes are compatible with specific inorganic cathodes and could catalyze the assembly of full SIBs prototypes. This Research News article aims to summarize the recent critical reports on ether‐based electrolytes in sodium‐based batteries, to unveil the uniqueness of ether‐based electrolytes to advancing diverse electrode materials, and to shed light on the viability and challenges of ether‐based electrolytes in future sodium‐based battery chemistries."

Here, we report that the sodium ion intercalation behavior of expanded GO strongly depends on the amounts and ratios of different functional groups. The epoxide-rich GO shows significantly higher specific capacities than those of the hydroxyl-rich counterpart utilizing strong sodium–epoxide attractions and appropriately enlarged interlayer spacing during sodiation. The epoxide-rich GO also enables fast sodium ion transport on account of the diminishment of interlayer hydrogen bonds that could reduce the free volume.

Sn33Ge33Sb33, Sn50Ge25Sb25, Sn60Ge20Sb20, and Sn50Ge50 all demonstrate promising electrochemical behavior, with Sn50Ge25Sb25 being the best overall. This alloy has an initial reversible specific capacity of 833 mAhg(-1) (at 85 mAg(-1)) and 662 mAhg(-1) after 50 charge-discharge cycles. Sn50Ge25Sb25 also shows excellent rate capability, displaying a stable capacity of 381 mAhg(-1) at a current density of 8500 mAg(-1) (∼10C). A survey of published literature indicates that 833 mAhg(-1) is among the highest reversible capacities reported for a Sn-based NIB anode, while 381 mAhg(-1) represents the optimum fast charge value. HRTEM shows that Sn50Ge25Sb25 is a composite of 10-15 nm Sn and Sn-alloyed Ge nanocrystallites that are densely dispersed within an amorphous matrix. Comparing the microstructures of alloys where the capacity significantly exceeds the rule of mixtures prediction to those where it does not leads us to hypothesize that this new phenomenon originates from the Ge(Sn) that is able to sodiate beyond the 1:1 Na:Ge ratio reported for the pure element. Combined TOF-SIMS, EELS TEM, and FIB analysis demonstrates substantial Na segregation within the film near the current collector interface that is present as early as the second discharge, followed by cycling-induced delamination from the current collector."

The mesoporous C/Sn anodes in a Na‐ion battery shows similar cycling stability but lower capacity and poorer rate capability than that in a Li‐ion battery. The desodiation potentials of Sn anodes are approximately 0.21 V lower than delithiation potentials. The low capacity and poor rate capability of C/Sn anode in Na‐ion batteries is mainly due to the large Na‐ion size, resulting in slow Na‐ion diffusion and large volume change of porous C/Sn composite anode during alloy/dealloy reactions. Understanding of the reaction mechanism between Sn and Na ions will provide insight towards exploring and designing new alloy‐based anode materials for Na‐ion batteries."

        "abstract": "Atomic-layer-deposition (ALD) coatings have been increasingly used to improve battery performance. However, the electrochemical and mechanistic roles remain largely unclear, especially for ALD coatings on electrodes that undergo significant volume changes (up to 100%) during charging/discharging. Here we investigate an anode consisting of tin nanoparticles (SnNPs) with an ALD-Al2O3 coating. For the first time, in situ transmission electron microscopy unveiled the dynamic mechanical protection of the ALD-Al2O3 coating by coherently deforming with the SnNPs under the huge volume changes during charging/discharging. Battery tests in coin-cells further showed the ALD-Al2O3 coating remarkably boosts the cycling performance of the Sn anodes, comparing with those made of bare SnNPs. Chemomechanical simulations clearly revealed that a bare SnNP debonds and falls off the underlying substrate upon charging, and by contrast the ALD-Al2O3 coating, like ion-conductive nanoglue, robustly anchors the SnNP anode to the substrate during charging/discharging, a key to improving battery cycle performance."

Herein, the Na storage and ion migration properties of M2C-type MXenes (M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Nb, Mo) were investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and were compared to the Li case. Based on the average voltage and migration barrier of surface ions, we suggest that M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, and Mo are suitable for sodium ion battery (SIB) anodes. These screened M2C materials can provide a theoretical capacity of 190-288 mA h g(-1) by accommodating two alkali ions per formula unit. They also exhibit an activation barrier of 0.1-0.2 eV for ionic motion, suggesting that the M2C materials are promising for high-power applications. The underlying aspects of the voltage differences between M2C materials are also discussed using electrostatic considerations."

Nb2 O5 is one typical model anode material with promising high-rate lithium storage. However, its modest reaction kinetics and low electrical conductivity obstruct the efficient storage of larger ions of sodium or potassium. In this work, partially surface-amorphized and defect-rich black niobium oxide@graphene (black Nb2 O5- x @rGO) nanosheets are designed to overcome the above Na/K storage problems. The black Nb2 O5- x @rGO nanosheets electrodes deliver a high-rate Na and K storage capacity (123 and 73 mAh g-1 , respectively at 3 A g-1 ) with long-term cycling stability. Besides, both Na-ion and K-ion full batteries based on black Nb2 O5- x @rGO nanosheets anodes and vanadate-based cathodes (Na0.33 V2 O5 and K0.5 V2 O5 for Na-ion and K-ion full batteries, respectively) demonstrate promising rate and cycling performance. Notably, the K-ion full battery delivers higher energy and power densities (172 Wh Kg-1 and 430 W Kg-1 ), comparable to those reported in state-of-the-art K-ion full batteries, accompanying with a capacity retention of ≈81.3% over 270 cycles. This result on Na-/K-ion batteries may pave the way to next-generation post-lithium batteries."

        "abstract": "Over the past decades, ground‐breaking techniques and transformative progress have been achieved on exploring alternative battery candidates beyond lithium‐ion batteries, among which sodium‐/potassium‐ion batteries (SIBs/PIBs) are receiving rapidly increased attention. Great efforts have been devoted to developing verified anode materials. Carbon materials take the leading position because of their abundance, low‐cost, environmental friendless, and commercial potential. While it is easy to understand which specific carbon material exhibits outstanding performance, the understanding of electrochemical reaction mechanisms, the structure–performance relation, and the interfacial properties of carbon anodes are rather difficult. It is urgently required to comprehensively summarize and further compare these fundamental issues, but it is still insufficient. This review concentrates on recent progress of carbon materials for SIBs and PIBs, and at the beginning summarizes the fabrication and characterization of different carbon allotropes, then fundamentally compares the ion storage mechanisms and interfacial chemistries. Furthermore, the relationship between the mechanism‐oriented and interface‐correlated performance and material optimization strategies is established. Finally, critical challenges and future developments of carbon anodes for the practical realization of SIBs/PIBs are proposed. This review gives a comprehensive summary and perspective from mechanisms to material design, offering a reliable guidance of carbon materials for SIBs and PIBs."

        "abstract": "Lithium ion batteries exhibit high energy and power densities, thereby making them a promising power sources for multifarious applications. However, the abundance of lithium (Li) is one of the major critical issues for using Li battery technologies. Therefore, for large-scale applications a sodium (Na) ion battery is one of the apt alternatives for portable electronics instead of expensive Li ion batteries. One of the challenging issues in Na+ ion batteries is the difficulty to understand the chemistry involved in view of the large size of the Na+ ion as compared to the Li+ ion, which makes the alloying/dealloying difficult during cycling. Hence, in this present work, we explore an innovative concept of storing Na+ ions in reduced graphene oxide/antimony (Sb) metal composites. Such a concept of storing Na+ in the rGO/Sb composite is one of the simplest ways to enhance the electrochemical performance of metal-based anodes for sodium ion batteries. Furthermore, it is seen that the nano rGO sheet transforms to nanoribbons upon galvanostatic cycling, as evidenced by TEM."

        "abstract": "Polymerization-induced phase separation of nanoparticle-filled solution is demonstrated as a simple approach to control the structure of porous composites. These composites are subsequently demonstrated as the active component for sodium ion battery anode. To synthesize the composites, we dissolved/dispersed titanium oxide (anatase) nanoparticles (for sodium insertion) and poly(hydroxybutyl methacrylate) (PHBMA, porogen) in furfuryl alcohol (carbon precursor) containing a photoacid generator (PAG). UV exposure converts the PAG to a strong acid that catalyzes the furfuryl alcohol polymerization. This polymerization simultaneously decreases the miscibility of the PHBMA and reduces the mobility in the mixture to kinetically trap the phase separation. Carbonization of this polymer composite yields a porous nanocomposite. This nanocomposite exhibits nearly 3-fold greater gravimetric capacity in Na-ion batteries than the same titanium oxide nanoparticles that have been coated with carbon. This improved performance is attributed to the morphology as the carbon content in the composite is five times that of the coated nanoparticles. The porous composite materials exhibit stable cyclic performance. Moreover, the battery performance using materials from this polymerization-induced phase separation method is reproducible (capacity within 10% batch-to-batch). This simple fabrication methodology may be extendable to other systems and provides a facile route to generate reproducible hierarchical porous morphology that can be beneficial in energy storage applications."

The implications of this are profound: the properties of many battery materials should be reassessed. Sodium ion battery anodes made from nanocrystalline bismuth form different phases during electrochemical cycling compared to anodes with larger crystallites. This is due to the formation of a metastable cubic polymorph of Na3Bi on the crystallite surfaces. The structural differences (weaker Na–Bi bonds, different coordination of Na to Bi) between the metastable cubic Na3Bi phase found in the nanocrystals and the hexagonal equilibrium polymorph which dominates the larger crystallites offer an explanation for the improvements in cycling behavior observed for the nanostructured anode."

The MoSe2/N‐C composite, which consists of carbon‐coated MoSe2 nanosheets, is synthesized through solvothermal and annealing method.

        "abstract": "Designing potential anodes for sodium‐ion battery with both remarkable durability and high‐rate capability has captured enormous attention so far. The engineering of size and morphology is deemed as an effective manner to boost the electrochemical properties. Owing to the anisotropic self‐assembly of iron selenide, rod‐like FeSe2 coates with nitrogen‐doped carbon is prepared through the thermal reaction of Prussian blue with selenium. Notably, the cyano groups are effectively transformed into N‐doped carbon with FeNC bonds, which uniformly coats FeSe2, prompting Na+ transportations. Interestingly, the particle size is tailored by heating rates, along with increased carbon content, leading to broadened energy levels for redox reaction. Bestowed by these advantages, the FeSe2/N‐C as Na‐storage anode delivers impressive electrochemical properties. Even at a rather high rate of 10.0 A g−1, a considerable capacity of 308 mAh g−1 is yielded over 10 000 loops. Supported by the detailed analysis of kinetic features, reduced size of particles could bring about the enhanced contributions of pseudocapacitive and quickening rate of ions transferring. The phase evolutions are further investigated by in situ EIS and ex‐situ technologies. The work is expected to provide a new strategy to prepare metal‐selenide with controllable size and induce the faster kinetic of high‐rate materials."

        "abstract": "Metal sulfides are emerging as a promising anode material for sodium‐ion batteries with high reversible capacities and fast reaction kinetics, but achieving long‐cycling‐life remains a great challenge. Here, taking cobalt sulfide as an example, its electrochemical sodium‐ion storage failure phenomenon is first reported, which indicates that the battery cannot reach the cut‐off voltage during charging. Detailed analyses demonstrate that such failure may originate from the dissolution and escape of polysulfide intermediates, further reacting with the released copper‐ions from the current collector and inducing the occurrence of the shuttle effect. Based on the explored failure mechanism, a sulfur‐doped carbon matrix with polar carbon sulfur bonds, which can firmly immobilize the dissolved polysulfides, is deliberately introduced into the Co1−xS active particles (Co1−xS/s‐C) to improve their cycle stability. Consequently, the cycle life of the Co1−xS/s‐C anode for sodium‐ion storage is extended from the original 125 to present 2000 cycles, even at high‐rate current densities. Moreover, utilizing the carbon current collector instead of traditional copper can effectively delay the occurrence of the failure phenomenon. The present work promotes better fundamental understanding of the structural evolution of metal sulfide anodes during cycles, and the solution strategy can be extended to apply in other metal sulfides (ZnS, NiS)."

Battery cycling showed that ZnMn2O4 exhibited the best performance (discharge capacity, cycling, and rate capability) compared to the two other manganites and their corresponding simple oxides.

        "title": "Unfolding the Mechanism of Sodium Insertion in Anatase TiO2 Nanoparticles",
        "abstract": "It is frequently assumed that sodium‐ion battery chemistry exhibits a behavior that is similar to the more frequently investigated lithium‐ion chemistry. However, in this work it is shown that there are great, and rather surprising, differences, at least in the case of anatase TiO2. While the generally more reducing lithium ion is reversibly inserted in the anatase TiO2 lattice, sodium ions appear to partially reduce the rather stable oxide and form metallic titanium, sodium oxide, and amorphous sodium titanate, as revealed by means of in situ X‐ray diffraction, ex situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Nevertheless, once the electrochemical transformation of anatase TiO2 is completed, the newly formed material presents a very stable long‐term cycling performance, excellent high rate capability, and superior coulombic efficiency, highlighting it as a very promising anode material for sodium‐ion battery applications."

        "abstract": "Binders have been reported to play a key role in improving the cycle performance of Si anode materials of lithium‐ion batteries. In this study, the biopolymer guar gum (GG) is applied as the binder for a silicon nanoparticle (SiNP) anode of a lithium‐ion battery for the first time. Due to the large number of polar hydroxyl groups in the GG molecule, a robust interaction between the GG binder and the SiNPs is achieved, resulting in a stable Si anode during cycling. More specifically, the GG binder can effectively transfer lithium ions to the Si surface, similarly to polyethylene oxide solid electrolytes. When GG is used as a binder, the SiNP anode can deliver an initial discharge capacity as high as 3364 mAh g−1, with a Coulombic efficiency of 88.3% at the current density of 2100 mA g−1, and maintain a capacity of 1561 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles. The study shows that the electrochemical performance of the SiNP anode with GG binder is significantly improved compared to that of a SiNP anode with a sodium alginate binder, and it demonstrates that GG is a promising binder for Si anodes of lithium‐ion batteries."

        "abstract": "Na‐metal batteries are considered as the promising alternative candidate for Li‐ion battery beneficial from the wide availability and low cost of sodium, high theoretical specific capacity, and high energy density based on the plating/stripping processes and lowest electrochemical potential. For Na‐metal batteries, the crucial problem on metallic Na is one of the biggest challenges. Mossy or dendritic growth of Na occurs in the repetitive Na stripping/plating process with an unstable solid electrolyte interphase layer of nonuniform ionic flux, which can not only lead to the low Coulombic efficiency, but also can create short circuit risks, resulting in possible burning or explosion. In this communication, the atomic layer deposition of Al2O3 coating is first demonstrated for the protection of metallic Na anode for Na‐metal batteries. By protecting Na foil with ultrathin Al2O3 layer, the dendrites and mossy Na formation have been effectively suppressed and lifetime has been significantly improved. Furthermore, the thickness of protective layer has been further optimized with 25 cycles of Al2O3 layer presenting the best performance over 500 cycles. The novel design of atomic layer deposition protected metal Na anode may bring in new opportunities to the realization of the next‐generation high energy‐density Na metal batteries."

The influence of Fe content on the structure, morphology, and electrochemical performance was systematically investigated. When utilized as a sodium ion battery anode, 6.99%-Fe-doped TiO2 exhibited the best electrochemical performance. This sample delivered a very high reversible capacity (327.1 mAh g-1 at 16.8 mA g-1) and superior rate performance (160.5 mAh g-1 at 840 mA g-1), as well as long-term cycling stability (no capacity fading at 1680 mA g-1 over 3000 cycles). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with experimental results indicated that the significantly improved sodium storage ability of the Fe-doped sample should be mainly due to the increased oxygen vacancies, narrowed band gap, and lowered sodiation energy barrier, which enabled much higher electronic/ionic conductivities and more favorable sodium ion intercalation into rutile TiO2."

The Na-Nafion membrane provides a facile Na+-ion conductive path and serves as a cation-selective shield to prevent the migration of the polysulfides to the anode.

Silicon has shown some promise for replacing graphite because of its exceptional capacity, but the dramatic volume change during lithiation-delithiation processes often leads to failure. Jin et al. developed a composite that is made of black phosphorous and graphite in its core and covered with swollen polyaniline. In contrast to previous efforts, bonding between the carbon and phosphorous allows for a high charging rate without sacrifices in capacity and cycling stability. Science, this issue p. 192 Black phosphorus composites with engineered interfaces deliver high capacity, high rate capability, and long cycle life. High-rate lithium (Li) ion batteries that can be charged in minutes and store enough energy for a 350-mile driving range are highly desired for all-electric vehicles. A high charging rate usually leads to sacrifices in capacity and cycling stability. We report use of black phosphorus (BP) as the active anode for high-rate, high-capacity Li storage. The formation of covalent bonds with graphitic carbon restrains edge reconstruction in layered BP particles to ensure open edges for fast Li+ entry; the coating of the covalently bonded BP-graphite particles with electrolyte-swollen polyaniline yields a stable solid–electrolyte interphase and inhibits the continuous growth of poorly conducting Li fluorides and carbonates to ensure efficient Li+ transport.

However, few studies have been reported that investigate their working mechanism in detail. Here, the operando synchrotron X‐ray diffraction is employed to thoroughly investigate the operational mechanism of a hybrid LiFePO4(LFP)/Zn battery, which indicates only Li+ extraction/insertion from/into cathode during cycling. Based on this system, a cheap electrolyte additive, sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate, is proposed to effectively enhance its electrochemical properties. The influence of the additive on the Zn anode and LFP cathode is comprehensively studied, respectively. The results show that the additive modifies the intrinsic deposit pattern of Zn2+ ions, rendering Zn plating/stripping highly reversible in an aqueous medium. On the other hand, the wettability of the LFP electrode is visibly a meliorated by introducing the surfactant additive, accelerating the Li‐ion diffusion at the LFP electrode/electrolyte interface, as indicated by the overpotential measurements. Benefiting from these effects, the Zn/LFP batteries deliver high rate capability and cycling stability in both coin cells and pouch cells."

ALD is known to improve the cycling performance, Coulombic efficiency of batteries, and maintain electrode integrity. Here, the electrochemical performance of uncoated P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 electrodes is compared to that of ALD-coated Al2O3 P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 electrodes. Given that ALD coatings are in the early stage of development for NIB cathode materials, little is known about how ALD coatings, in particular aluminum oxide (Al2O3), affect the electrode-electrolyte interface. Therefore, full characterizations of its effects are presented in this work. For the first time, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to elucidate the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on ALD-coated electrodes. It contains less carbonate species and more inorganic species, which allows for fast Na kinetics, resulting in significant increase in Coulombic efficiency and decrease in cathode impedance. The effectiveness of Al2O3 ALD coating is also surprisingly reflected in the enhanced mechanical stability of the particle which prevents particle exfoliation."

In this work, porous hollow Co3O4 with N-doped carbon coating (Co3O4/N-C) polyhedrons have been prepared using cobalt-based MOFs as a sacrificial template. Assembled from tiny nanoparticles and N-doped carbon coating, Co3O4/N-C composite shortens the diffusion length of Li+/Na+ ions and possesses an enhanced conductivity. And the porous and hollow structure is also beneficial for tolerating volume changes in the galvanostatic discharge/charge cycles as lithium/sodium battery anode materials. As a result, it can exhibit impressive cycling and rating performance. At 1000 mA g-1, the specific capacities maintaine stable values of ∼620 mAh g-1 within 2000 cycles as anodes in lithium ion battery, while the specific capacity keeps at 229 mAh g-1 within 150 cycles as sodium ion battery anode. Our work shows comparable cycling performance in lithium ion battery but even better high-rate cycling stability as sodium ion battery anode. Herein, we provide a facile method to construct high electrochemical performance oxide/N-C composite electrode using new MOFs as sacrificial template."

        "abstract": "Superoxide based metal-air (or metal-oxygen) batteries, including potassium and sodium-oxygen batteries, have emerged as promising alternative chemistries in the metal-air battery family because of much improved round-trip efficiencies (>90%). In order to improve the cycle life of these batteries, it is crucial to understand and control the side reactions between the electrodes and the electrolyte. For potassium-oxygen batteries using ether-based electrolytes, the side reactions on the potassium anode have been identified as the main cause of battery failure. The composition of the side products formed on the anode, including some reaction intermediates, have been identified and quantified. Combined experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show the side reactions are likely driven by the interaction of potassium with ether molecules and the crossover of oxygen from the cathode. To inhibit these side reactions, the incorporation of a polymeric potassium ion selective membrane (Nafion-K(+)) as a battery separator is demonstrated that significantly improves the battery cycle life. The K-O2 battery with the Nafion-K(+) separator can be discharged and charged for more than 40 cycles without increases in charging overpotential."

However, the large ionic radius of the Na-ion (1.07 Å) brings a key scientific challenge, restricting the development of electrode materials for SIBs, and the infeasibility of graphite and silicon in reversible Na-ion storage further promotes the investigation of advanced anode materials. Currently, the key issues facing anode materials include sluggish electrochemical kinetics and a large volume expansion. Despite these challenges, substantial conceptual and experimental progress has been made in the past. Herein, we present a brief review of the recent development of intercalation, conversion, alloying, conversion-alloying, and organic anode materials for SIBs. Starting from the historical research progress of anode electrodes, the detailed Na-ion storage mechanism is analyzed. Various optimization strategies to improve the electrochemical properties of anodes are summarized, including phase state adjustment, defect introduction, molecular engineering, nanostructure design, composite construction, heterostructure synthesis, and heteroatom doping. Furthermore, the associated merits and drawbacks of each class of material are outlined, and the challenges and possible future directions for high-performance anode materials are discussed."

This is a topic of interest for developing novel anodes with high storage capacity. Owing to their low cost, high stability, and conductivity, carbon-based materials have been studied extensively. However, sp2-C based carbon materials have low-rate capacities. Intensive density functional theory calculations have been implemented to explore the applicability of α, β, and γ graphyne nanotubes (αGyNTs, βGyNTs, and γGyNTs, respectively) as SIB anodes. Results suggest that (3, 0)-αGyNT, (2, 2)-βGyNT, and (4, 0)-γGyNT have, respectively, maximum Na storage capacities of 1535, 1302, and 1001 mAh/g, which exceeds the largest reported value of carbon materials (N-doped graphene foams with 852.6 mAh/g capacity). It was determined that αGyNTs have the largest storage capacity of the three types because they possess the largest specific surface area. Moreover, the larger pores of αGyNTs and βGyNTs allow easier diffusion and penetration of Na atoms compared to those of γGyNTs, which could result in better rate capacity."

        "abstract": "High-energy sodium-ion batteries have a significant prospective application as a next-generation energy storage technology. However, this technology is severely hindered by the lack of large-scale production of battery materials. Herein, a self-standing film, assembled with SnS-Sn/multiwalled carbon nanotubes encapsulated in carbon fibers (SnS-Sn/MCNTs@CFs), is prepared using ball milling and electrospinning techniques and used as sodium-ion battery anodes. To compensate the poor internal conductivity of SnS-Sn nanoparticles, MCNTs are used to interweave SnS-Sn nanoparticles to improve the conductivity. Moreover, the designed three-dimensional carbon fiber conductive network can effectively shorten the diffusion path of electron/Na+, accelerate the reaction kinetics, and provide abundant active sites for sodium absorption. Benefiting from these unique features, the self-standing film offers a high reversible capacity of 568 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and excellent cycling stability at 1 A g-1 with a reversible capacity of 359.3 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles. In the sodium-ion full cell device, the capacity is stable at 283.7 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at a current of 100 mA g-1. This work provides a new strategy for electrode design and facilitates the large-scale application of the sodium-ion battery."

Although both battery systems have basically similar chemistries, the key celebrated negative electrode in lithium battery, namely, graphite, is unavailable for the sodium-ion battery due to the larger size of the sodium ion. This need is satisfied by \"hard carbon\", which can internalize the larger sodium ion and has desirable electrochemical properties. Unlike graphite, with its specific layered structure, however, hard carbon occurs in diverse microstructural states. Herein, the relationships between precursor choices, synthetic protocols, microstructural states, and performance features of hard carbon forms in the context of sodium-ion battery applications are elucidated. Derived from the pertinent literature employing classical and modern structural characterization techniques, various issues related to microstructure, morphology, defects, and heteroatom doping are discussed. Finally, an outlook is presented to suggest emerging research directions."

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries operating at room temperature have emerged as a generation of energy storage devices to replace lithium-ion batteries; however, they are limited by a lack of anode materials with both an adequate lifespan and excellent rate capability. To address this issue, we developed Nb2CTx MXene-framework MoS2 nanosheets coated with carbon (Nb2CTx@MoS2@C) and constructed a robust three-dimensional cross-linked structure. In such a design, highly conductive Nb2CTx MXene nanosheets prevent the restacking of MoS2 sheets and provide efficient channels for charge transfer and diffusion. Additionally, the hierarchical carbon coating has a certain level of volume elasticity and excellent electrical conductivity to guarantee the intercalation of sodium ions, facilitating both fast kinetics and long-term stability. As a result, the Nb2CTx@MoS2@C anode delivers an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 530 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 200 cycles and very long cycling stability with a capacity of 403 mA h g-1 and only 0.01% degradation per cycle for 2000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1. Moreover, this anode has an outstanding capacity retention rate of approximately 88.4% from 0.1 to 1 A g-1 in regard to rate performance. Most importantly, the Nb2CTx@MoS2@C anode can realize a quick charge and discharge at current densities of 20 or even 40 A g-1 with capacities of 340 and 260 mAh g-1, respectively, which will increase the number of practical applications for sodium-ion batteries."

        "abstract": "Hard carbons, an important category of amorphous carbons, are non‐graphitizable and are widely accepted as the most promising anode materials for emerging sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs)， because of their changeable low‐potential charge/discharge plateaus. However, their microstructures are not fixed and are difficult to accurately demonstrate as graphites do. The successful use of hard carbons in SIBs revives the interest to clearly picture their complicated microstructures that are in close relevance to sodium storage. In this review, the past definitions and structural models of hard carbons are revisited first, and a renewed understanding of their sodium storage is presented. Three critical structural features are highlighted for hard carbons, namely crystallites, defects, and nanopores, which are directly responsible for the presence of the low‐potential plateaus and their reversible extension. The impact of these structural features upon the sodium storage is then deeply discussed and sieving carbons is finally proposed as an ideal configuration of carbon anode for superhigh sodium storage. This review is expected to offer a clear picture of hard carbons, and help realize a truly rational design of high‐capacity carbon anodes, driving the industrialization of SIBs, and more promisingly open up a window for exploring their possible new uses."

        "abstract": "Phosphorus doped carbons are of particular interest as anode materials because of their large interlayer spacing and strong adsorption of Na+ ions. However, it remains challenging to achieve high phosphorus doping due to the limited choices of phosphorus sources and the difficulty in constructing oxygen‐free synthesis system. Herein, a new synthesis strategy is proposed to prepare ultrahigh phosphorus‐doped carbon (UPC) anodes for high performance sodium ion batteries (SIBs). By using two commonly available, miscible, evaporable liquids in PCl3 and C6H12, as phosphorus and carbon sources, an oxygen‐free reaction system is successfully established by N2 bubbling to simultaneously realize carbonization and in situ P doping. The P content can reach 30 wt%, much higher than most reported P‐doping carbon‐based materials. Furthermore, the doped P is dominated by substitutional P(C3) protrusions in the carbon lattice, which can significantly enlarge the interlayer spacing and enhance the adsorption energy of Na+. When serving as the SIBs anode, the UPC delivers an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 510.4 mAh g−1 with a rational operating voltage of 0.54 V, and the best rate capability of 397.1 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1.

Here, we report a general approach to synthesize a series of molecule-intercalated MoS2 with a precisely controlled interlayer distance of 0.62 to 1.24 nm in which the electrical conductivity could be also widely and finely adjusted from 1.3 × 10-4 to 3.5 × 10-2 S cm-1 via the insertion of different molecules. By adjusting the interlayer space and enhancing the electrical conductivity, the highest initial sodium ion storage capacity of 465 mA h g-1 (vs 195 mA h g-1 for the pure MoS2 anode) and the highest capacity of 420 mA h g-1 (vs 31 mA h g-1 for the pure MoS2 anode) after 600 cycles at a rate of 100 mA g-1 were obtained. The excellent performance is credited to the rapid Na+ and electron transport and higher material utilization derived from the synergistic effect of the expanded interlayer space and the higher electronic conductivity.

        "abstract": "Although studies of transition metal sulfides (TMS) as anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries are extensively reported, the short cycle life is still a thorny problem that impedes their practical application. In this work, a new capacity fading mechanism of the TMS electrodes is demonstrated; that is, the parasitic reaction between electrolyte anions (i.e., ClO4−) and metal sulfides yields non‐conductive and unstable solid‐electrolyte interphase (SEI) and meanwhile, corrosively turns metal sulfides into less‐active oxides. This knowledge guides the development of an electrochemical strategy to manipulate the anion decomposition and construct a stable interface that prevents extensive parasitic reactions. It is shown that introducing sodium nitrate to the electrolyte radically changes the Na+ solvation structure by populating nitrate ions in the first solvation sheath, generating a stable and conductive SEI layer containing both Na3N and NaF. The optimized interface enables an iron sulfide anode to stably cycle for over 2000 cycles with negligible capacity loss, and a similar enhancement in cycle performance is demonstrated on a number of other metal sulfides. This work discloses metal sulfides’ cycling failure mechanism from a unique perspective and highlights the critical importance of manipulating the interface chemistry in sodium‐ion batteries."

An exquisite hierarchical heterogeneous of bimetal sulfide Sb2S3@FeS2 hollow nanorods embedded into nitrogen-doped carbon matrix is fabricated by a concise two-steps of solvothermal method. The FeS2 interlayer bulges in-situ grow on the interface of hollow Sb2S3 nanorods within the nitrogen-doped graphene matrix, forming a delicate heterostructure. Such a well-designed architecture affords rapid Na+ diffusion and improves charge transfer at the heterointerfaces. Meanwhile, the strongly synergistic coupling interaction among the interior Sb2S3, interlayer FeS2, and external nitrogen-doped carbon matrix creates a steady nanostructure, which extremely accelerates the electronic/ion transport and effectively alleviates the volume expansion upon long cyclic process. As a result, the composite, as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries, exhibits superior rate capability of 537.9 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1, excellent cyclic stability with 85.7 % capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 5 A g-1. Based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculation, the existing constructing heterojunction in this composite can not only optimize the electronic structure to enhance the conductivity, but also favor the Na2S adsorption energy to accelerate the reaction kinetics. The outstanding electrochemical performance sheds light on the strategy by rational designing of hierarchical heterogeneous nanostructure for energy storage applications."

In order to improve the cycle performance, Sn/N-doped carbon microcage composites (Sn/NMCs) with Sn nanodots uniformly embedded inside the N-doped carbon microcages are synthesized through a simple spray drying process, followed by thermal treatment. When used as electrodes, Sn/NMCs exhibit an initial reversible capacity of 780 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1, and maintain 472 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles in LIBs. For Na-ion batteries, Sn/NMCs deliver an initial reversible capacity of 439 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and maintain 332 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles. The remarkable electrochemical performance is mainly owing to the advanced structure of Sn/NMCs, which could be attributed to the pore-formation using NaCl, and the grain size inhibition of Sn using N-doped carbon. Moreover, this preparation method is accessible to scale up and can be extended to fabricate other electrode materials."

It is shown that a proper treatment of phase transitions during sodiation, though often neglected in the ..."

        "abstract": "The cost and practicality of greenhouse gas removal processes, which are critical for environmental sustainability, pivot on high-value secondary applications derived from carbon capture and conversion techniques. Using the solar thermal electrochemical process (STEP), ambient CO2 captured in molten lithiated carbonates leads to the production of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) at high yield through electrolysis using inexpensive steel electrodes. These low-cost CO2-derived CNTs and CNFs are demonstrated as high performance energy storage materials in both lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries. Owing to synthetic control of sp3 content in the synthesized nanostructures, optimized storage capacities are measured over 370 mAh g–1 (lithium) and 130 mAh g–1 (sodium) with no capacity fade under durability tests up to 200 and 600 cycles, respectively. This work demonstrates that ambient CO2, considered as an environmental pollutant, can be attributed economic value in grid-scale and portable energy storage systems with STEP scale-up practicality in the context of combined cycle natural gas electric power generation."

        "abstract": "Transition-metal selenides have emerged as promising anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, they suffer from volume expansion, polyselenide dissolution, and sluggish kinetics, which lead to inadequate conversion reaction toward sodium and poor reversibility during the desodiation process. Therefore, the transition-metal selenides are far from long cycling stability, outstanding rate performance, and high initial Coulombic efficiency, which are the major challenges for practical application in SIBs. Here, an efficient anode material including an FeSe2 core and N-doped carbon shell with inner void space as well as high conductivity is developed for outstanding rate performance and long cycle life SIBs. In the ingeniously designed FeSe2@NC microrods, the N-doped carbon shell can facilitate mass transport/electron transfer, protect the FeSe2 core from the electrolyte, and accommodate volume variation of FeSe2 with the help of the inner void of the core. Thus, the FeSe2@NC microrods can maintain strong structural integrity upon long cycling and ensure a good reversible conversion reaction of FeSe2 during the discharge/charge process. As a result, the as-prepared FeSe2@NC microrods exhibit excellent sodium storage performance and ultrahigh stability, achieving an excellent rate capability (411 mAh g-1 at 10.0 A g-1) and a long-term cycle performance (401.3 mAh g-1 after 2000 cycles at 5.0 A g-1)."

        "abstract": "Heteroatom‐doped carbon materials with expanded interlayer distance have been widely studied as anodes for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, it remains unexplored to further enlarge the interlayer spacing and reveal the influence of heteroatom doping on carbon nanostructures for developing more efficient SIB anode materials. Here, a series of N‐rich few‐layer graphene (N‐FLG) with tuneable interlayer distance ranging from 0.45 to 0.51 nm is successfully synthesized by annealing graphitic carbon nitride (g‐C3N4) under zinc catalysis and selected temperature (T = 700, 800, and 900 °C). More significantly, the correlation between N dopants and interlayer distance of resultant N‐FLG‐T highlights the effect of pyrrolic N on the enlargement of graphene interlayer spacing, due to its stronger electrostatic repulsion. As a consequence, N‐FLG‐800 achieves the optimal properties in terms of interlayer spacing, nitrogen configuration and electronic conductivity. When used as an anode for SIBs, N‐FLG‐800 shows remarkable Na+ storage performance with ultrahigh rate capability (56.6 mAh g−1 at 40 A g−1) and excellent long‐term stability (211.3 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 after 2000 cycles), demonstrating the effectiveness of material design."

        "abstract": "The successful development of post‐lithium technologies depends on two key elements: performance and economy. Because sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) can potentially satisfy both requirements, they are widely considered the most promising replacement for lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) due to the similarity between the electrochemical processes and the abundance of sodium‐based resources. Among various SIB anode materials, metal sulfides are most extensively studied as materials for high‐performance electrodes due to the versatility of their synthesis procedure, utilization potential, and high sodiation capacity. Herein, some of the most effective strategies aimed at effectively alleviating the performance shortcomings of these materials from the materials engineering/design perspective are summarized. In terms of facilitating ion transport in SIBs, which represents one of the most critical aspects of their performance, a specific family of strategies related to a particular operational mechanism is considered rather than categorizing based‐on individual sulfide materials. In the foreseeable future, the development of highly functional SIBs electrode materials and utilization of metal sulfides will become highly relevant due to their stability and performance characteristics. Therefore, it is anticipated that this review will guide further research and facilitate the realization of various applications of sulfide‐based high‐performance rechargeable batteries."

        "abstract": "Sodium (ion) batteries are promising alternatives for lithium-ion batteries due to their lower cost caused by global sodium availability. However, the low Coulombic efficiency (CE) of the sodium metal plating/stripping process represents a serious issue for the Na anode, which hinders achieving higher energy density. Herein, we report that the Na+ solvation structure, particularly the type and location of the anions, plays a critical role in determining the Na anode performance. We show that the low CE results from anion-mediated corrosion, which can be tackled readily through tuning the anion interaction at the electrolyte/anode interface. Our strategy thus enables fast charging Na-ion and Na-S batteries with remarkable cycle-life. The presented insights differ from the prevailing interpretation that the failure mechanism mostly results from sodium dendrite growth and/or solid electrolyte interphase formation. Our anionic model introduces a new guideline for improving the electrolytes for metal (ion) batteries with greater energy density."

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are promising low-cost alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in energy storage applications because of the natural abundance of sodium as compared with lithium. However, the radius of Na+ ions is ∼50% larger than that of Li+ ions, leading to challenging sodiation/desodiation at the anodes of SIBs and reduced performances. Therefore, the exploration of novel SIB anode materials to facilitate sodiation/desodiation has become a leading area of research. Here, cost-effective phosphorus and metal/nonmetal phosphides, possessing high theoretical gravimetric capacities and volumetric specific capacities, have emerged as new and promising anode materials for SIBs. Based on this, this review will provide a comprehensive summary of the recent progress in the development of phosphorus and metal/nonmetal phosphide materials and corresponding composite SIB anodes in terms of material synthesis, characterization, sodium storage mechanism and performance validation in SIB apparatuses. In addition, challenges associated with the development of such advanced materials are summarized and analyzed. Finally, to facilitate the research and development of these emerging SIB anode materials, future research directions are proposed to overcome challenges toward the practical commercialization of sodium-ion batteries."

        "abstract": "Structural pulverization of metal chalcogenides such as Sn-based compounds is a serious issue for development of high-performance anode materials and results in serious capacity fading during continuous charge and discharge cycles. In this work, we synthesize ultra-small SnS quantum dots (QDs) anchored onto nitrogen-enriched carbon (NC) nanospheres through facile hydrothermal and carbonization processes to prepare a progressive anode material for sodium-ion batteries. The optimized SnS QDs@NC electrode delivered an initial discharge capacity of 281 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 and exhibited excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 75% after 500 cycles at high current density of 1,000 mA g-1. Ex-situ XRD, XPS, FE-SEM, TEM measurements and kinetic study were performed to unveil the sodium storage mechanism of the SnS QDs@NC electrode. A sodium-ion full cell assembled with SnS QDs@NC anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode exhibited high capacity and good cycling stability. Such a superior electrochemical performance of SnS QDs@NC can be attributed to the synergistic effects of NC and SnS QDs, where NC serves as a conducting matrix to support SnS QDs and helps avoid structural degradation. This work provides a promising strategy to resolve the pulverization issue of alloying and conversion-type anode materials."

        "abstract": "With the aim of advancing anatase TiO2 anodes for sodium ion batteries, crystalline titania nanocubes were employed and they delivered a gradually increasing capacity during the initial cycles, termed as an activation process. The number of necessary discharge–charge loops for total activation is dependent on the galvanostatic current density (about 20 cycles at 0.2 C, or 90 cycles at 1 C). A percentage of Ti3+ was detected after the activation, indicating an amount of irreversibly trapped sodium ions in the lattice. After the activation process, an excellent rate capability and outstanding cycling stability were presented. The reversible capacity reached 174, 132, and 108 mA h g−1 at rates of 1 C, 5 C, and 10 C, respectively. The capacity was sustained with a loss of less than 10% after 1000 discharge–charge cycles at a rate of 2 C or 10 C. The superior battery performance achieved by the nanocubes is related to the encircled {100} facets that are more favorable for sodium ion attachment compared to the {001} and {101} facets, as supported by first-principles calculations. From this work we can see the feasibility of optimizing electrode materials via rational surface structure construction based on theoretical calculations."

In respect of this, we design and fabricate Fe2O3/Fe3O4 nano-aggregates anchored on nitrogen-doped graphene as an anode for sodium-ion batteries with the assistance of microwave plasma. The highly conductive Fe3O4 in the composite can function as a highway of electron transport, and the voids and phase boundaries in the Fe2O3/Fe3O4 heterostructure facilitate Na+ ion diffusion into the nano-aggregates. Furthermore, the Fe–O–C bonds between the nano-aggregates and graphene not only stabilize the structural integrity, but also enhance the charge transfer. Consequently, the Fe2O3/Fe3O4/NG anode exhibits specific capacity up to 362 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1, excellent rate capability, and stable long-term cycling performance. This multi-component-based heterostructure design can be used in anode materials for lithium- and sodium-ion batteries, and potential opens a new path for energy storage electrodes."

So far, only few materials can serve as the host for both Na+ and K+ ions. Herein, a cubic phase CuSe with crystal‐pillar‐like morphology (CPL‐CuSe) assembled by the nanosheets are synthesized and its dual functionality in SIBs and PIBs is comprehensively studied. The electrochemical measurements demonstrate that CPL‐CuSe enables fast Na+ and K+ storage as well as the sufficiently long duration. Specifically, the anode delivers a specific capacity of 295 mA h g−1 at current density of 10 A g−1 in SIBs, while 280 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 in PIBs, as well as the high capacity retention of nearly 100% over 1200 cycles and 340 cycles, respectively. Remarkably, CPL‐CuSe exhibits a high initial coulombic efficiency of 91.0% (SIBs) and 92.4% (PIBs), superior to most existing selenide anodes. A combination of in situ X‐ray diffraction and ex situ transmission electron microscopy tests fundamentally reveal the structural transition and phase evolution of CuSe, which shows a reversible conversion reaction for both cells, while the intermediate products are different due to the sluggish K+ insertion reaction."

Further, Ti-based oxides show high operating voltage relative to the deposition of alkali metal, ensuring full safety by avoiding the formation of lithium and sodium dendrites. On the other hand, high working potential prevents the decomposition of electrolyte, delivering excellent rate capability through the unique pseudocapacitive kinetics.

Recently, various work and in-depth understanding on the morphologies control, surface engineering, bulk-phase doping of Ti-based oxides, have been promoted to overcome these issues. Inspired by that, in this review, the authors summarize the fundamental issues, challenges and advances of Ti-based oxides in the applications of advanced electrochemical energy storage. Particularly, the authors focus on the progresses on the working mechanism and device applications from lithium-ion batteries to sodium-ion batteries, and then the hybrid pseudocapacitors.

        "abstract": "We demonstrate that peat moss, a wild plant that covers 3% of the earth's surface, serves as an ideal precursor to create sodium ion battery (NIB) anodes with some of the most attractive electrochemical properties ever reported for carbonaceous materials. By inheriting the unique cellular structure of peat moss leaves, the resultant materials are composed of three-dimensional macroporous interconnected networks of carbon nanosheets (as thin as 60 nm). The peat moss tissue is highly cross-linked, being rich in lignin and hemicellulose, suppressing the nucleation of equilibrium graphite even at 1100 °C. Rather, the carbons form highly ordered pseudographitic arrays with substantially larger intergraphene spacing (0.388 nm) than graphite (c/2 = 0.3354 nm). XRD analysis demonstrates that this allows for significant Na intercalation to occur even below 0.2 V vs Na/Na(+). By also incorporating a mild (300 °C) air activation step, we introduce hierarchical micro- and mesoporosity that tremendously improves the high rate performance through facile electrolyte access and further reduced Na ion diffusion distances. The optimized structures (carbonization at 1100 °C + activation) result in a stable cycling capacity of 298 mAh g(-1) (after 10 cycles, 50 mA g(-1)), with ∼150 mAh g(-1) of charge accumulating between 0.1 and 0.001 V with negligible voltage hysteresis in that region, nearly 100% cycling Coulombic efficiency, and superb cycling retention and high rate capacity (255 mAh g(-1) at the 210th cycle, stable capacity of 203 mAh g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1))."

        "abstract": "While sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) represent a low‐cost substitute for Li‐ion batteries (LIBs), there are still several key issues that need to be addressed before SIBs become market‐ready. Among these, one of the most challenging is the negligible sodium uptake into graphite, which is the keystone of the present LIB technology. Although hard carbon has long been established as one of the best substitutes, its performance remains below that of graphite in LIBs and its sodium storage mechanism is still under debate. Many other carbons have been recently studied, some of which have presented capacities far beyond that of graphite. However, these also tend to exhibit larger voltage and high first cycle loss, leading to limited benefits in terms of full cell specific energy. Overcoming this concerning tradeoff necessitates a deep understanding of the charge storage mechanisms and the correlation between structure, microstructure, and performance. This review aims to address this by drawing a roadmap of the emerging routes to optimization of carbon materials for SIB anodes on the basis of a critical survey of the reported electrochemical performances and charge storage mechanisms."

Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are considered as promising anode candidates for SIBs with high theoretical capacity, while their intrinsic low electrical conductivity and large volume expansion upon Na+ intercalation raise the challenging issues of poor cycle stability and inferior rate performance. Herein, the designed formation of hybrid nanoboxes composed of carbon-protected CoSe2 nanoparticles anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon hollow skeletons (denoted as CoSe2 @C∩NC) via a template-assisted refluxing process followed by conventional selenization treatment is reported, which exhibits tremendously enhanced electrochemical performance when applied as the anode for SIBs.

Herein, an SnSe/FLG (few-layer graphene) composite with high tap density (2.3 g cm-3) is synthesized via plasma milling method, in which SnSe nanoparticles are strongly bound with the FLG matrix, owing to both Sn-C and Se-C bonds, to form nanosized primary particles and then assemble to microsized secondary granules. The FLG can effectively alleviate the large stress generated from volume expansion of SnSe during cycling, based on its superstrength. Furthermore, as demonstrated by the density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, the Sn-C and Se-C co-bonding benefitting from the formation of substantial vacancy defects on the P-milling synthesized FLG enables strong affinity between SnSe nanoparticles and FLG matrix, preventing SnSe from aggregating and detaching even after long-term cycling. As anode for lithium-ion batteries, it exhibits high gravimetric and volumetric capacity (864.8 mAh g-1 and 1990 mAh cm-3 at 0.2 A g-1), high rate (612.6 mAh g-1 even at 5.0 A g-1) and the longest life among the reported SnSe-based anodes (capacity retention of 92.8% after 2000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1). Subsequently, impressive cyclic life (capacity retention of 91.6% after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1) is also achieved for sodium-ion batteries.

The present work demonstrates that single‐phase ternary cobalt phosphoselenide (CoPSe) in the form of nanoparticles embedded in a layered metal–organic framework (MOF)‐derived N‐doped carbon matrix (CoPSe/NC) represents an ultrastable and high‐rate anode material for SIBs/PIBs. The CoPSe/NC is fabricated by using the MOF as both a template and precursor, coupled with in situ synchronous phosphorization/selenization reactions. The CoPSe anode holds a set of intrinsic merits such as lower mechanical stress, enhanced reaction kinetics, as well as higher theoretical capacity and lower discharge voltage relative to its counterpart of CoSe2, and suppressed shuttle effect with higher intrinsic electrical conductivity relative to CoPS. The involved mechanisms are evidenced by substantial characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Consequently, the CoPSe/NC anode shows an outstanding long‐cycle stability and rate performance for SIBs and PIBs. Moreover, the CoPSe/NC‐based Na‐ion full cell can achieve a higher energy density of 274 Wh kg−1, surpassing that based on CoSe2/NC and most state‐of‐the‐art Na‐ion full cells based on P‐, Se‐, or S‐containing binary/ternary anodes to date."

        "abstract": "Transition-metal sulfides hold great promise as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries due to the high theoretical capacity and excellent redox reversibility based on multielectron conversion reactions. In this work, an elaborate composite, cobalt sulfide nanoclusters embedded in honeycomb-like sulfur-doped carbon foam (Co9S8@S-CF), is prepared via a facile sulfur-assisting calcination strategy, which tactfully induces the co-occurrence of in situ pore-forming, sulfidation, sulfur doping, and carbonization. Notably, sulfur-doped carbon foam (S-CF) possesses abundant voids, which are subject to construction of three-dimensional ionic/electronic pathways, leading to high sodium-ion accessibility and ultrafast sodium-ion/electron transportation toward Co9S8 nanoclusters. When worked as an anode in sodium-ion batteries, it delivers a remarkable capacity of 373 mA h g-1 over 1000 cycles at 0.25 C, achieving superior capacity retention of 80%. Furthermore, this anode could achieve unprecedented rate capability with a reversible capacity of 180 mA h g-1 at 50 C (20 A g-1), which significantly precedes those reported previously."

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) have a promising application prospect for energy storage systems due to the abundant resource. Amorphous carbon with high electronic conductivity and high surface area is likely to be the most promising anode material for SIBs. However, the rate capability of amorphous carbon in SIBs is still a big challenge because of the sluggish kinetics of Na+ ions. Herein, a three‐dimensional amorphous carbon (3DAC) with controlled porous and disordered structures is synthesized via a facile NaCl template‐assisted method. Combination of open porous structures of 3DAC, the increased disordered structures can not only facilitate the diffusion of Na+ ions but also enhance the reversible capacity of Na storage. When applied as anode materials for SIBs, 3DAC exhibits excellent rate capability (66 mA h g−1 at 9.6 A g−1) and high reversible capacity (280 mA h g−1 at a low current density of 0.03 A g−1). Moreover, the controlled porous structures by the NaCl template method provide an appropriate specific surface area, which contributes to a relatively high initial Coulombic efficiency of 75%. Additionally, the high‐rate 3DAC material is prepared via a green approach originating from low‐cost pitch and NaCl template, demonstrating an appealing development of carbon anode materials for SIBs."

This composite has an interlayer spacing of MoSe2 expanded to facilitate sodium‐ion diffusion, MoSe2 immobilized on carbon nanosheets to improve charge‐transfer kinetics, and N and P incorporated into carbon to enhance its interaction with active species upon cycling. These features greatly improve the electrochemical performance of this composite, as compared to all the controls.

Ex situ Raman spectra and high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy images confirm that it is element Se, rather than MoSe2, formed after the charging process. The interaction of the active species with modified carbon is simulated using density functional theory to explain this excellent stability. The superior rate capability, where the capacity at 15 A g−1 equals ≈55% of that at 0.5 A g−1, could be associated with the significant contribution of pseudocapacitance.

The key point of constructing a high‐performance SIHC is to couple appropriate anode and cathode materials, which can well match in capacity and kinetics behavior simultaneously. In this work, a novel SIHC, coupling a titanium dioxide/carbon nanocomposite (TiO2/C) anode with a 3D nanoporous carbon cathode, which are both prepared from metal–organic frameworks (MOFs, MIL‐125 (Ti) and ZIF‐8, respectively), is designed and fabricated. The robust architecture and extrinsic pseudocapacitance of TiO2/C nanocomposite contribute to the excellent cyclic stability and rate capability in half‐cell. Hierarchical 3D nanoporous carbon displays superior capacity and rate performance. Benefiting from the merits of structures and performances of anode and cathode materials, the as‐built SIHC achieves a high energy density of 142.7 W h kg−1 and a high power output of 25 kW kg−1 within 1–4 V, as well as an outstanding life span of 10 000 cycles with over 90% of the capacity retention.

However, it is a great challenge for most LTMS electrodes to have long cycling life and high‐rate capability due to their larger volume expansion and the formation of soluble polysulfide intermediates caused by the conversion reaction. Herein, layered CuS microspheres with tunable interlayer space and pore volumes are reported through a cost‐effective interaction method using a cationic surfactant of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB). The CuS–CTAB microsphere as an anode for SIBs reveals a high reversible capacity of 684.6 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, and 312.5 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1 after 1000 cycles with high capacity retention of 90.6%. The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the unique structure of this material, and a high pseudocapacitive contribution ensures its high‐rate performance. Moreover, in situ X‐ray diffraction is applied to investigate their sodium storage mechanism. It is found that the long chain CTAB in the CuS provides buffer space, traps polysulfides, and restrains the further growth of Cu particles during the conversion reaction process that ensure the long cycling stability and high reversibility of the electrode material."

It is also worth noting that the NiS1.03 PHSs//FeFe(CN)6 full cell is successfully assembled and exhibits an initial reversible capacity of 460 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1, which further evidence that NiS1.03 is a kind of prospective anode material for SIBs."

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion-based capacitors and batteries are considered as a low-cost energy storage technology alternative to their lithium-ion counterparts owing to the abundance of sodium in Earth. Their widespread use is however limited by the lack of high-performance electrode materials. In this work, we report that MXenes-Ti3C2 can be oxidized into a Ti-peroxo complex gel at room temperature by simply adding H2O2, from concentrated to dilute. The highly water-soluble property of this gel allows the synthesis of a graphene-supported TiO2 nanocomposite with highly porous nano-/meso-hybrid architecture via a more facile and environmentally friendly way. The unique hybrid architecture of the produced TiO2–RGO nanocomposite results in pseudocapacitive behavior in Na+ charge storage with high reversibility, fast kinetics, long cyclability, and negligible degradation to the parent structure. By incorporating the TiO2–RGO composite as the anode, a novel sodium-ion capacitor is constructed that is capable of operating at a high voltage of 4.0 V and delivering a maximum energy density of 94.7 W h kg−1, which is comparable to lithium-ion based capacitors. The approach reported here could be potentially extended for fabricating a host of MXenes-derived metal oxide nanomaterials or nanocomposites for numerous applications, particularly in view of the expanding MXenes portfolio."

        "abstract": "The current Na+ storage performance of carbon‐based materials is still hindered by the sluggish Na+ ion transfer kinetics and low capacity. Graphene and its derivatives have been widely investigated as electrode materials in energy storage and conversion systems. However, as anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), the severe π–π restacking of graphene sheets usually results in compact structure with a small interlayer distance and a long ion transfer distance, thus leading to low capacity and poor rate capability. Herein, partially reduced holey graphene oxide is prepared by simple H2O2 treatment and subsequent low temperature reduction of graphene oxide, leading to large interlayer distance (0.434 nm), fast ion transport, and larger Na+ storage space. The partially remaining oxygenous groups can also contribute to the capacity by redox reaction. As anode material for SIBs, the optimized electrode delivers high reversible capacity, high rate capability (365 and 131 mAh g−1 at 0.1 and 10 A g−1, respectively), and good cycling performance (163 mAh g−1 after 3000 cycles at a current density of 2 A g−1), which is among the best reported performances for carbon‐based SIB anodes."

Biomass carbon materials were explored for their low cost and wide range of sources. Here, a hard carbon material with a \"honeycomb\" structure using pine pollen (PP) as a precursor was successfully prepared and applied as an anode. The initial discharge capacity can reach 370 mA h g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1. After cycling 200 times, the reversible capacity also stabled at 203.3 mA h g-1 with the retention rate of 98%. We further studied the sodium storage mechanism by different methods, especially the Na+ diffusivity coefficient ( DNa+) calculated by galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, which was more accurate. Interestingly, the trend of DNa+ coincides with cyclic voltammetry curves. Carbonized PP exhibited excellent electrochemical properties because of its three-dimensional structure and larger layer spacing (∼0.41 nm), which reduces the resistance of sodium ions to intercalation and deintercalation."

However, the scarcity of suitable anode materials hinders their application. Herein, we report a bismuth intercalated graphite (Bi@Graphite) anode material, which is substantially different from the previously reported metal@Graphene. In Bi@Graphite, the Bi nanoparticles between graphite interlayers enhance the capacity, while the graphite sheath provides a robust fast electronic connection for long cycling stability. The Bi@Graphite possesses a safe average storage potential of approximately 0.5 V vs. Na/Na+, delivers a capacity of ∼160 mA h g−1 at 1C (160 mA g−1), exhibits outstanding cycling stability (ca. 90% capacity retention for 10 000 cycles at 20C), and can maintain 70% capacity at 300C (∼110 mA h g−1 at 48 A g−1), which is equivalent to full charge/discharge in 12 s. Bi@Graphite demonstrates the highest rate-capability ever reported among all anodes for SIBs. Detailed characterization results indicate that the unique Bi nanoparticle-in-graphite structure and the fast kinetics of ether co-intercalation into graphite are responsible for these significant improvements, which could translate into SIBs with excellent power densities."

Not only can such unique porous crystal Si/amorphous SiO2 nanoparticles uniformly dispersed in the OMC matrix mitigate the volume change of active materials during the cycling process, but they can also improve electrical conductivity of Si/SiO2 and facilitate the Li+ /Na+ diffusion.

Meanwhile, carbon-based materials provide the most promising anode materials. Because of the large radius of sodium ions, SIBs do not exhibit favorable electrochemical performance. Introducing heteroatoms into the carbon-lattice is an effective strategy to enlarge the interlayer space of carbon-based materials which can improve carbon's electrochemical performance. In addition, anode materials with a surface-induced capacitive process can enhance the SIB's electrochemical performance because its capacitive process increases the kinetics of ion diffusion. Here, we describe an SIB's anode material containing nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene sheets [denoted as poly(2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole) (PDMcT)/reduced graphene oxide (RGO)] which are synthesized via carbonization of PDMcT polymerized on the surface of GO.

These unique results are attributed to the enlarged interlayer spacing and electronic conductivity from the heteroatoms which facilitate the sodium ion's insertion and electron transport.

This study shows that the bulk Bi electrode is gradually developed into a porous integrity during initial cycling, which is totally different from that in carbonate‐based electrolytes and ensures facile Na+ transport and structural stability. The achievable capacity of bulk Bi in the NaPF6‐diglyme electrolyte is high up to 400 mAh g−1, and the capacity retention is 94.4% after 2000 cycles, corresponding to a capacity loss of 0.0028% per cycle. It exhibits two flat discharge/charge plateaus at 0.67/0.77 and 0.46/0.64 V, ascribed to the typical two‐phase reactions of Bi ↔ NaBi and NaBi ↔ Na3Bi, respectively. The excellent performance is attributed to the unique porous integrity, stable solid electrolyte interface, and good electrode wettability of glymes.

        "abstract": "Transition metal phosphides have been extensively investigated owing to their high theoretical capacities and relatively low intercalation potentials vs Li/Li+, but their practical applications have been hindered by low electrical conductivity and dramatic volume variation during cycling. In this work, an interesting strategy for the rational design of graphene (GR) encapsulated with a hollow FeP@carbon nanocomposite (H-FeP@C@GR) via a combination of a hydrothermal route, a carbon-coating process, phosphidation treatment, and carbothermic reaction is reported. The hollow FeP (H-FeP) nanospheres shelled with thin carbon layers are wonderfully incorporated into the GR matrix, interconnecting to form a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical architecture. Such a design offers distinct advantages for FeP-based anode materials for both lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium ion batteries (SIBs). For example, the 3D omnibearing conductive networks from the GR skeleton and outer coating carbon can provide an open freeway for electron/ion transport, promoting the electrode reaction kinetics. In addition, the wrapping of an H-FeP nanosphere in a thin carbon layer enables the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the carbon layer surface instead of on the individual H-FeP surface, preventing the continual re-forming of the SEI. When used as anode materials for LIBs and SIBs, H-FeP@C@GR exhibited excellent electrochemistry performances."

        "abstract": "MXenes, a novel family of two dimensional (2D) materials with excellent electronic conductivity and hydrophilicity, have emerged as a promising material for energy storage. Based on the intercalation mechanism, MXenes have demonstrated an excellent performance for supercapacitors but low capacities for sodium-ion batteries. Herein, we developed a facile solution-phase method to fabricate the Sb2O3/MXene(Ti3C2Tx) hybrid materials for sodium storage with enhanced electrochemical performances. The as-prepared Sb2O3/Ti3C2Tx composite has a hierarchical structure with Sb2O3 nanoparticles (sub-50 nm) uniformly incorporated in the MXene Ti3C2Tx 3D networks. The Sb2O3 nanoparticles serve as a sufficient sodium ion reservoir; meanwhile, the MXene Ti3C2Tx network provides highly efficient pathways for transport of electrons and Na-ions. The volume expansion of Sb2O3 during sodiation/desodiation can be buffered and confined between the 2D Ti3C2Tx sheets. As a result, the Sb2O3/Ti3C2Tx hybrid anodes present good structural stability and superior electrochemical performance in Na-ion batteries, including an excellent rate performance with a capacity of 295 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1, and an enhanced cycling performance with a capacity of 472 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1. This work is expected to inspire the development of MXene materials for high performance batteries."

The study shows that the electrochemical performance of the HCTs is seriously affected by the carbonization temperature due to the difference in their microstructure and heteroatomic content. The HCTs carbonized at 1300 °C deliver the highest reversible capacity of 315 mAh g−1 and good rate capability due to their unique tubular structure.

        "abstract": "The abundance of sodium resources has recently motivated the investigation of sodium ion batteries (SIBs) as an alternative to commercial lithium ion batteries. However, the low power and low capacity of conventional sodium anodes hinder their practical realization. Although most research has concentrated on the development of high-capacity sodium anodes, anodes with a combination of high power and high capacity have not been widely realized. Herein, we present a simple microwave irradiation technique for obtaining few-layered, ultrathin two-dimensional SnS2 over graphene sheets in a few minutes. SnS2 possesses a large number of active surface sites and exhibits high-capacity, rapid sodium ion storage kinetics induced by quick, nondestructive pseudocapacitance. Enhanced sodium ion storage at a high current density (12 A g-1), accompanied by high reversibility and high stability, was demonstrated. Additionally, a rationally designed sodium ion full cell coupled with SnS2//Na3V2(PO4)3 exhibited exceptional performance with high initial Coulombic efficiency (99%), high capacity, high stability, and a retention of ∼53% of the initial capacity even after the current density was increased by a factor of 140. In addition, a high specific energy of ∼140 Wh kg-1 and an ultrahigh specific power of ∼8.3 kW kg-1 (based on the mass of both the anode and cathode) were observed. Because of its outstanding performance and rapid synthesis, few-layered SnS2 could be a promising candidate for practical realization of high-power SIBs."

        "abstract": "In this work, the performance and electrochemical charge/discharge behavior of Sn–Bi–Sb alloy films were examined, as well as pure Sn, Bi, and Sb films, as anodes for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Alloying was utilized as an approach to modify the morphology and active phases in an effort to improve the cycling stability of elemental anodes of Sn or Sb, while maintaining a high capacity. The films were prepared via sputtering, which enabled study of a broad swath of compositional space. The cycling performance of the Sb-rich compositions surpassed that of all other alloys tested as anodes for SIBs. The best performing alloy had a composition of 10 at% Sn, 10 at% Bi, and 80 at% Sb (called Sn10Bi10Sb80, here), and maintained 99% of its maximum capacity during cycling (621 mA h g−1) after 100 cycles. Stability of these anodes dropped as the quantity of Sb decreased; to contrast, Sn20Bi20Sb60, Sn25Bi25Sb50 and Sn33Bi33Sb33 were increasingly less stable as anodes in SIBs as the molar quantity of Sb in the films dropped to 60%, 50%, and 33%, respectively. The Sn10Bi10Sb80 electrode was found to possess a single phase as-deposited microstructure of Sn and Bi in substitutional solid solution with the Sb lattice and the sodiation sequence was found to be significantly different from pure Sb. Numerous possible mechanisms for the improvement in capacity retention were discussed, where modification and material response to internal stresses by changes in the Sb chemical potential and solid solution strengthening were found to be the most likely."

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries offer an attractive option for potential low cost and large scale energy storage due to the earth abundance of sodium. Red phosphorus is considered as a high capacity anode for sodium-ion batteries with a theoretical capacity of 2596 mAh/g. However, similar to silicon in lithium-ion batteries, several limitations, such as large volume expansion upon sodiation/desodiation and low electronic conductance, have severely limited the performance of red phosphorus anodes. In order to address the above challenges, we have developed a method to deposit red phosphorus nanodots densely and uniformly onto reduced graphene oxide sheets (P@RGO) to minimize the sodium ion diffusion length and the sodiation/desodiation stresses, and the RGO network also serves as electron pathway and creates free space to accommodate the volume variation of phosphorus particles. The resulted P@RGO flexible anode achieved 1165.4, 510.6, and 135.3 mAh/g specific charge capacity at 159.4, 31878.9, and 47818.3 mA/g charge/discharge current density in rate capability test, and a 914 mAh/g capacity after 300 deep cycles in cycling stability test at 1593.9 mA/g current density, which marks a significant performance improvement for red phosphorus anodes for sodium-ion chemistry and flexible power sources for wearable electronics."

However, multi-step and harsh synthetic methods with high temperatures and high pressures are major obstacles that need to be overcome. Herein a simple, low-cost, and scalable approach is proposed to construct ultrafine SnO2/graphene nanomaterials effectively under constant pressure and at the low temperature of 80 °C for 4 h, in which ultrafine SnO2 nanoparticles grow on graphene sheets uniformly and firmly via Sn–O–C bonding. This result depends on the synergetic effect of two reactions, the reduction of graphene oxide and formation of SnO2 nanoparticles, which are achieved successfully. More importantly, the constructed SnO2/graphene material exhibits excellent electrochemical properties in both lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries. As an anode material for lithium-ion batteries, it displays a high reversible capacity (1420 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 90 cycles) and good cycling life (97% at 1 A g−1 after 230 cycles), whereas in sodium-ion batteries, it maintains a capacity of 1280 mA h g−1 at 0.05 A g−1 and 650 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 after 90 cycles.

In this paper, a zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) with a unique polyhedral morphology and large size (about 2 μm) was successfully synthesized through a facile co-precipitation method. After successive carbonization and sulfidation, ZnS nanoparticles decorated on nitrogen-doped porous carbon polyhedra (ZnS/NPC) were obtained. When applied as the anode material for LIBs, the ZnS/NPC hybrid displays the highest reversible specific capacity for ZnS-based electrodes reported so far (1067.4 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 200 cycles), excellent rate capability (364.6 mA h g−1 at 4 A g−1), and robust long-term cycling performance (856.8 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 1000 cycles). As for SIBs, the resultant ZnS/NPC also exhibits a desirable capacity of 370.6 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 and 289.2 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1. Such superior lithium and sodium storage performances should be attributed to the distinctive structure advantages inherited from ZIF-8, where the Zn ions were in situ converted to ZnS with high reactivity upon electrochemical cycling and the organic linkers were pyrolyzed to nitrogen-doped porous carbon polyhedra to enhance the conductivity of the hybrid and keep the structure stability during cycling."

        "abstract": "Hydrazine-reduced graphite oxide and graphene oxide were synthesized to compare their performances as anode materials in lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries. Reduced graphite oxide inherits the layer structure of graphite, with an average spacing between neighboring layers (d-spacing) of 0.374 nm; this exceeds the d-spacing of graphite (0.335 nm). The larger d-spacing provides wider channels for transporting lithium ions and sodium ions in the material. We showed that reduced graphite oxide as an anode in lithium-ion batteries can reach a specific capacity of 917 mA h g-1, which is about three times of 372 mA h g-1, the value expected for the LiC6 structures on the electrode. This increase is consistent with the wider d-spacing, which enhances lithium intercalation and de-intercalation on the electrodes. The electrochemical performance of the lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries with reduced graphite oxide anodes show a noticeable improvement compared to those with reduced graphene oxide anodes. This improvement indicates that reduced graphite oxide, with larger interlayer spacing, has fewer defects and is thus more stable. In summary, we found that reduced graphite oxide may be a more favorable form of graphene for the fabrication of electrodes for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries and other energy storage devices."

It compensates the irreversible Na uptake at the oxygen-containing functional groups and reacts with carbon defects of five/seven-membered rings for quasi-metallic sodium in HC. The as-formed sodium induces robust NaF-rich SEI on HC in 1.0 M NaPF6 in diglyme, favoring the interfacial reaction kinetics and stable Na+ insertion and extraction. This renders the presodiated HC (pHC) with high ICE of ~100% and capacity retention of 82.4% after 6800 cycles. It is demonstrated to couple with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathodes in full cells to show high capacity retention of ~100% after 700 cycles.

Such a unique structure can not only protect the active materials from direct exposure to the electrolyte as well as restrain the migration and pulverization of the SnO2, but also offer rich void space for buffering the volume changes and complement the electron conductivity of the active materials, thus achieving remarkably enhanced electrical conductivity and structural integrity of the whole electrode. As a consequence, this C@SnO2@C HNS electrode exhibited an extremely outstanding long-life high-rate cycling stability for both LIB and SIB anodes, such as only 8% capacity loss after 1000 cycles at 10 A g−1 for LIB anode and only 10% capacity loss after 3000 cycles at 4.6 A g−1 for SIB anodes. As far as we know, this is the best high-rate cycle performance ever reported for SnO2-based SIB anodes."

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) show great potential as alternative energy storage devices for next generation energy storage systems due to the deficiency of lithium resources. MoS2 is a promising anode material for SIBs due to its high theoretical sodium storage capability and large interspace for accommodating sodium ions with a larger ionic radius than lithium ions. However, bulk MoS2 exhibits a sluggish kinetics for the intercalation-deintercalation of sodium ions and large volume expansion, which result in poor cyclability and rate performance. In this study, we designed few-layered MoS2/C nanoflowers with expanded interspacing of MoS2-MoS2 planes using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as an intercalating reagent and a carbon precursor. Due to the unique nanostructure and larger interlayer spacing, the MoS2/C nanoflower electrode achieves a high reversible specific capacity of 400 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles at 500 mA g-1 for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), showing a good cycling stability. The improved electrochemical performance suggests that the MoS2/C composite is a promising anode material for sodium ion storage."

Besides, this material also shows excellent cycling stability, at a current density of 5 A g−1, the reversible capacity can still reach 149 mAh g−1 after 5000 cycles.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have caught considerable attention in last few years owing to the abundance of sodium in comparison to lithium. The commercial graphite anode is demonstrated unsuitable as an anode material for SIBs due to the larger radius of Na+ ions, whereas the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) show great potential as anodes for SIBs because of their high achievable capacity. The sluggish kinetics, large volume expansion, and aggregation of those materials however results in severe decay of the electrochemical performance. In this work, a flower-like MoSe2 /C composite is synthesized with ethylenediamine and cassava starch (denoted as MoSe2 /Ccas ) and designed based on these principles: 1) expand the d-spacing of (0 0 2) planes of MoSe2 to enhance the kinetics for the intercalation-deintercalation of Na+ ions and 2) embed MoSe2 into the carbon matrix to enhance the conductivity and restrict the volume expansion and aggregation of MoSe2 . As a result, MoSe2 /Ccas exhibits superior cycle performance and rate capability for sodium storage. It shows durable long-life cycle capability with a reversible capacity of 360 mAh g-1 after 350 cycles at 0.5 Ag-1 . At the current density of 4 Ag-1 , the reversible capacity is still maintained at 266 mAh g-1 ."

The CoSe2 delivers excellent sodiation and desodiation properties when using 1 m NaCF3SO3 in diethyleneglycol dimethylether as an electrolyte and cycling between 0.5 and 3.0 V. A high discharge capacity of 0.410 Ah g−1 is obtained at 1 A g−1 after 1800 cycles, corresponding to a capacity retention of 98.6% calculated from the 30th cycle. Even at an ultrahigh rate of 50 A g−1, the capacity still maintains 0.097 Ah g−1. The reaction mechanism of the as‐prepared CoSe2 is also investigated. The results demonstrate that at discharged 1.56 V, insertion reaction occurs, while two conversion reactions take place at the second and third plateaus around 0.98 and 0.65 V. During the charge process, Co first reacts with Na2Se to form NaxCoSe2 and then turns back to CoSe2. In addition to Na/CoSe2 half cells, Na3V2(PO4)3/CoSe2 full cell with excessive amount of Na3V2(PO4)3 has been studied. The full cell exhibits a reversible capacity of 0.380 Ah g−1.

        "abstract": "A boron-doped carbon layer (BC) was coated on porous micron-sized Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) via a facile wet-chemical method for use as a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries. As determined by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, three different species (BC3, BC2O, and BCO2) were doped in the carbon layer on the surface of LTO. These heteroatoms lead to abundant extrinsic defects in the carbon layer that result in improved Na-ion diffusivity across the active material. Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the diffusion coefficient of the boron-doped carbon-coated LTO (BC-LTO) was found to be 2.241 × 10−15 cm2 s−1. The BC-LTO exhibited 85% and 60% higher Na-ion diffusivity than pristine LTO and carbon-coated LTO (C-LTO), respectively. Moreover, electron-deficient boron in BC3 enhances the electric conductivity through positively charged holes that carry electrons through the carbon structure. Accordingly, the BC-LTO electrode showed a high specific capacity of 148 mA h g−1 at 0.5C and 98.4 mA h g−1 at 10C rate. In addition, the BC-LTO anode demonstrated a great capacity retention of about 90% at 1 and 10C after 300 cycles. These findings demonstrate the promising potential of LTO as a high-performance anode material for sodium-ion batteries."

As an anode for lithium-ion batteries, CNSs exhibit reversible capacities of 830 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 1 A g−1 and 240 mA h g−1 at 20 A g−1, which is among the best of the reported lithium storage performances of carbon materials.

The high reversible capacity and excellent rate performance would be ascribed to the synergistic effect of the 2D structure, defects, and expanded crystallites. This work extends the sodium chloride template method to prepare thin CNSs by using a suitable carbon precursor and provides some insights into the relationship between the structure of CNSs and the electrochemical performance."

The remarkable electrochemical performance of 8‐Sn@C is owing to the synergetic effects between the well‐dispersed ultrasmall Sn nanoparticles and the conductive carbon network. This unique structure of very‐fine Sn nanoparticles embedded in the porous carbon network can effectively suppress the volume fluctuation and particle aggregation of tin during prolonged sodiation/desodiation process, thus solving the major problems of pulverization, loss of electrical contact and low utilization rate facing Sn anode."

        "abstract": "DOI: 10.1002/aenm.201501874 its spherical morphology well without surface cracking of the spheres, which explains its excellent capacity retention of 83% after 100 cycles. HCS is obtained by a hydrothermal reaction of dissolved sucrose, followed by pyrolysis. [ 10 ] The obtained product comprises carbon microspheres with diameters of around 5–10 μm ( Figure 1 a), and these spheres are of a fairly porous surface texture, as shown in the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Figure 1 b). HCS exhibits a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specifi c surface area of 65 m 2 g −1 . The nongraphitic hard carbon nature of HCS is revealed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectra. The XRD pattern of HCS shows a broad (002) peak, indicating a small stacking height of graphene layers, i.e., an average L c of ca. 1.4 nm estimated according to the Scherrer equation (Figure 1 c). Compared to the d-spacing of 0.335 nm in crystalline graphite, HCS exhibits an average inter-layer distance of ca. 0.400 nm, revealed by the position of the (002) peak. The Raman spectrum of HCS is very typical for nongraphitic carbon materials, which contains the D-band more intensive than the G-band, where they are assigned to A 1g vibration mode of sp 2 carbon rings caused by defects and E 2g vibration mode of sp 2 carbon atoms, respectively (Figure 1 d). We fi rst investigated the charge/discharge properties of the HCS electrode in KIBs, as compared to NIBs. Figure 2 a shows the typical potassiation/depotassiation potential profi les, where there is a high-potential sloping region and a low-potential quasiplateau region. Considering the available alkali metal ion storage mechanisms for hard carbon anodes, the two potential regions should correspond to K-ion insertion into different substructures or structural sites inside HCS, i.e., edges or defective sites of turbostratic nanodomains (TNs), inter-layer space inside TNs, and voids between TNs. [ 11 ] At C/10 (28 mAh g −1 ), the HCS/K cell presents a reversible capacity of 262 mAh g −1 in the depotassiation process, which is lower than 322 mAh g −1 from the HCS/Na cells (Figure 2 b). Furthermore, it is worthwhile pointing out that a capacity contribution of 200 mAh g −1 , 60% of the total capacity in HCS/Na cells, comes from its plateau region, where the sodiation potential is below 0.1 V versus Na + /Na. In contrast, it is only ca. 50 mAh g −1 , less than 20% of its total capacity in HCS/K cells, that is gained at potentials lower than 0.1 V versus K + /K. The difference in redox potentials between HCS/K and HCS/Na cells is more evident in the corresponding d Q /d V profi les (Figure 2 c,d). The HCS/K cell exhibits its potassiation and depotassiation peaks at 0.2 and 0.33 V versus K + /K, respectively, while both sodiation and desodiation peaks in the HCS/Na cell are lower than 0.1 V versus Na + /Na. When metal ion insertion occurs at potentials too close to the plating of the corresponding metal, dendrite formation can be a serious concern, particularly at high current rates. Great needs for electrochemical energy storage come from not only transportation but also stationary applications, e.g., home solar-power storage, microgrids, and load leveling. [ 1 ] However, for state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), lithium is simply too rare to be deployed in stationary facilities. [ 2 ] Therefore, there arises tremendous interest in alternative Earth-abundant metalion batteries, among which, sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) attract most attention due to the abundance of sodium and its similar “rocking chair” operation principle as LIBs. [ 3 ] Great progress has been made on new electrode materials for NIBs. [ 4 ]"

The materials possess low surface areas (19-217 m(2) g(-1)) and a relatively high electrode packing density (0.75 g cm(-3) vs ∼1 g cm(-3) for graphite). Tested against Na, BPPG delivers a gravimetric (and volumetric) capacity of 355 mAh g(-1) (by active material ∼700 mAh cm(-3), by electrode volume ∼270 mAh cm(-3)) after 10 cycles at 50 mA g(-1). A nearly flat ∼200 mAh g(-1) plateau that is below 0.1 V and a minimal charge/discharge voltage hysteresis make BPPG a direct electrochemical analogue to graphite but with Na. A charge capacity of 221 mAh g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1) is degraded by 7% after 600 cycles, while a capacity of 336 mAh g(-1) at 100 mAg(-1) is degraded by 11% after 300 cycles, in both cases with ∼100% cycling Coulombic efficiency. For LIB applications BPPG offers a gravimetric (volumetric) capacity of 1090 mAh g(-1) (by material ∼2200 mAh cm(-3), by electrode ∼900 mAh cm(-3)) at 50 mA g(-1). The reason that BPPG works so well for both NIBs and LIBs is that it uniquely contains three essential features: (a) dilated intergraphene spacing for Na intercalation at low voltages; (b) highly accessible near-surface nanopores for Li metal filling at low voltages; and (c) substantial defect content in the graphene planes for Li adsorption at higher voltages. The <0.1 V charge storage mechanism is fundamentally different for Na versus for Li. A combination of XRD and XPS demonstrates highly reversible Na intercalation rather than metal underpotential deposition. By contrast, the same analysis proves the presence of metallic Li in the pores, with intercalation being much less pronounced."

        "abstract": "Potassium- (PIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are emerging as promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries owing to the low cost and abundance of K and Na resources. However, the large radius of K+ and Na+ lead to sluggish kinetics and relatively large volume variations. Herein, a surface-confined strategy is developed to restrain SnS2 in self-generated hierarchically porous carbon networks with an in situ reduced graphene oxide (rGO) shell (SnS2 @C@rGO). The as-prepared SnS2 @C@rGO electrode delivers high reversible capacity (721.9 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 ) and superior rate capability (397.4 mAh g-1 at 2.0 A g-1 ) as the anode material of SIB. Furthermore, a reversible capacity of 499.4 mAh g-1 (0.05 A g-1 ) and a cycling stability with 298.1 mAh g-1 after 500 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g-1 were achieved in PIBs, surpassing most of the reported non-carbonaceous anode materials. Additionally, the electrochemical reactions between SnS2 and K+ were investigated and elucidated."

        "abstract": "In virtue of the abundant sodium resources, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have been considered to be one of the promising alternatives to lithium ion batteries (LIBs). However, current research concentrates mostly on sodium ion half-cells, and the development of sodium ion full cells with high performance remains a critical challenge. Here we rationally designed a full sodium-ion battery based on nanostructured Na2Ti3O7 and VOPO4 materials as the anodes and cathodes, owing to their advantageous electrochemical features. The full cell outputs one of the highest operating voltages close to 2.9 V and delivers a large reversible capacity of 114 mA h g−1 at a rate of 0.1C. It also shows outstanding rate capability (∼74 mA h g−1 at 2C rate) and excellent cycling stability (92.4% capacity retention after 100 cycles). A high energy density of 220 W h kg−1 is achieved, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art LIBs. Moreover, the temperature-dependent charge–discharge tests indicate excellent capacity retentions in a wide temperature range of −20 to 55 °C."

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are a promising candidate for grid electricity storage due to their potential low cost. The development of anode materials is a crucial step to promote the commercialization of SIBs, and amorphous carbon materials are likely to be the most promising alternatives among all proposed anode materials. However, the cost of the reported carbon materials is still very high due to the expensive precursors and their low carbon yield. Here, we report an amorphous carbon (AC) material made from low cost pitch. The amorphous carbon material with an amazing high carbon yield of 57% was achieved by utilizing the emulsification interaction between pitch and lignin to suppress the graphitization of pitch during the carbonization. The effects of heat-treatment temperatures and the pitch/lignin mass ratios on the morphology, microstructure and the electrochemical performance of AC were systematically investigated. By optimizing experimental conditions, we achieved one representative AC with a suitable morphology and microstructure, which exhibits promising performances with a high reversible capacity of 254 mA h g−1, a high initial coulombic efficiency of 82% and excellent cycling stability. This is the first demonstration that the pitch can be successfully applied in fabricating amorphous carbon anode materials for SIBs with superior low cost and high performance."

        "abstract": "Antimony (Sb) is an attractive anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) with a high theoretical capacity of 660 mAh g−1. However, its practical application is greatly hindered by the rapid capacity fading which is largely due to the large volume expansion during sodiation. Tuning the morphology and structure at the nanoscale or using carbonaceous materials as the buffer layer is essential to address this issue. Here, a facile carbon-coating coupled with a thermal-reduction strategy has been developed to synthesize unique Sb@C coaxial nanotubes. With different annealing time, the hollow space and the amount of Sb inside the tube can be easily tuned by the partial evaporation of Sb. The as-obtained Sb@C nanotubes exhibit excellent sodium storage properties. The remarkable electrochemical performance results from the unique coaxial nanoarchitecture. Specifically, it delivers a high specific capacity of 407 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 240 cycles. Furthermore, a stable capacity of 240 mAh g−1 can be retained at 1.0 A g−1 even after 2000 cycles. Most importantly, high capacities of 350 mAh g−1 and 310 mAh g−1 can be achieved at large current densities of 10 and 20 A g−1, respectively, which represents the best rate performance among the reported Sb-based anode materials."

Among all proposed anode materials for SIBs, red phosphorus (P) is a very promising candidate because it has the highest theoretical capacity (∼2600 mAh/g). In this study, a red P-single-walled carbon nanotube (denoted as red P-SWCNT) composite, in which red P is uniformly distributed between tangled SWCNTs bundles, is fabricated by a modified vaporization-condensation method. Benefiting from the nondestructive preparation process, the highly conductive and mechanically strong SWCNT network is preserved, which enhances the conductivity of the composite and stabilizes the solid electrolyte interphase. As a result, the red P-SWCNT composite presents a high overall sodium storage capacity (∼700 mAh/gcomposite at 50 mA/gcomposite), fast rate capability (∼300 mAh/gcomposite at 2000 mA/gcomposite), and stable long-term cycling performance with 80% capacity retention after 2000 sodiation-desodiation cycles.

        "title": "Selenium Phosphide (Se4P4) as a New and Promising Anode Material for Sodium‐Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "DOI: 10.1002/aenm.201601973 (≈10−5 S cm−1) and high theoretical capacity (678 mA h g−1).[24] Remarkably, Se shows higher cycling stability compared with that of elemental Sn.[25] However, pure Se is subjected to fast capacity fading mainly owing to the dissolution of polyselenide intermediates in electrolytes.[26,27] Previous studies have indicated that Se-based compounds can achieve highly stable cycling performance, owing to the favorable reaction mechanism to directly generate Na2Se without formation of polysenenide intermediates.[28,29] Therefore, alloying Se and P to form selenium phosphide (SexP1−x, 0.2 < x < 1.0) is strongly inspired. Actually, the family of SexP1−x, which can be synthesized by the melt-quenching method or the ball-milling technique, has been widely applied in electrical switches, display devices, and computer memories, owing to the good optical and semiconductive properties.[30,31] Among this family, Se4P4 is an important building block[32,33] and has stronger chemical stability in air relative to other SexP1−x compositions.[34] To the best of our knowledge, it has not yet been reported as electrode materials for rechargeable batteries. We here demonstrate that Se4P4 is a new and promising anode material for SIBs. The Se4P4 material with amorphous structure is synthesized by a facile mechanical milling method. The structural and electrochemical properties have been analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MASNMR), infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), transition electron microscope (TEM), and electrochemical measurements. Experimental results demonstrated that the Se4P4 material undergoes a reversible Na-storage reaction of Se4P4 + 20Na+ + 20e− ↔ 4Na3P + 4Na2Se during sodiation/ desodiation. As an anode material for SIBs, it displays a high reversible capacity of 1048 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 with excellent cycling stability (804 mA h g−1 after 60 cycles). Moreover, the reversible capacity is up to 724 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1 and maintains 332 mA h g−1 even at 3000 mA g−1. Compared with the previous reported P-based anode materials, Se4P4 shows much higher reversible capacity, better cycling stability, and rate capability. The superior electrochemical performance can be attributed to the synergetic Na-storage mechanism of Se and P components, which not only favors the electrochemical activation and reaction kinetics but also greatly enhances the structural stability of the material. The synthesis of Se4P4 was accomplished by facile mechanical milling of Se and red P with optimized rotating speed of 800 rpm and milling time of 10 h. More details of synthesis procedure and experimental optimization are provided in Experimental Section and Figure S1–S3 (Supporting Information). Figure 1a displays the SEM image of the as-synthesized material. It is clearly seen that the material is submicron to a few microns in size. The SEM images of bulk Se and red P are Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are attracting wide interests as a promising technique for large-scale energy storage due to the low cost and wide availability of Na resources.[1–3] An important part in developing SIBs is to investigate anode materials with high performance such as high reversible capacity, long cycling stability, and high rate capability.[4–7] Among the reported anode materials, elemental phosphorus (P) exhibits potential application owing to its attractive properties of low cost and high theoretical capacity (2595 mA h g−1).[8–11] However, it suffers from insufficient cycling stability and poor rate performance because of the intrinsic low electrical conductivity (≈10−14 S cm−1)[12] and huge volume variation (≈490%)[13] during sodiation/desodiation. Previous reports suggest that the formation of P-based compounds by alloying P with other conductive elements is an effective strategy to enhance the electrical conductivity and buffer volume variation.[14–16] Nevertheless, these conductive elements are usually electrochemically inactive component such as Fe and Ni, resulting in the inferior utilization of electrodes.[17,18] Moreover, most of the reported P-based materials undergo low practical capacity, fast capacity fading, and poor cycling stability due to large reaction irreversibility caused by aggregation and pulverization.[19] Recent studies show that the P-based compounds Sn4P3 (1133 mA h g−1)[20] and SnP3 (1616 mA h g−1)[21] have shown promising electrochemical performance owing to the both active elements of Sn and P, and the synergetic Na-storage process in which the sodiated products or intermediates can synergetically facilitate the reaction process.[22] As reported, Sn4P3 delivers a stable capacity of 718 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1.[20] While SnP3 exhibits a reversible capacity of 810 mA h g−1 at 150 mA g−1 and retains a capacity of 570 mA h g−1 at 640 mA g−1.[21] However, they are still limited by insufficient reaction kinetics, showing practical capacities far below the theoretical values. A main reason is that elemental Sn not only contributes to the capacity but also endures severe volume variation (525%) during cycling, causing the difficulty to maintain structural stability.[23] Thus, exploiting new P-based compounds with fast reaction kinetics and good structural stability are urgent for the design of high-performance SIBs. On the other hand, elemental selenium (Se) is also an interesting Na-storage material due to its good electrical conductivity"

        "abstract": "The design of sodium ion batteries is proposed based on the use of flexible membrane composed of ultrasmall transition metal oxides. In this paper, the preparation of CuO quantum dots (≈2 nm) delicately embedded in carbon nanofibers (denoted as 2-CuO@C) with a thin film via a feasible electrospinning method is reported. The CuO content can be controlled by altering the synthetic conditions and is optimized to 54 wt%. As binder-free anode for sodium ion batteries, 2-CuO@C delivers an initial reversible capacity of 528 mA h g-1 at the current density of 100 mA g-1 , an exceptional rate capability of 250 mA h g-1 at 5000 mA g-1 , and an ultra-stable capacity of 401 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 500 mA g-1 . The enhancement of electrochemical performance is attributed to the unique structure of 2-CuO@C, which offers a variety of advantages: highly conductive carbon matrix suppressing agglomeration of CuO grains, interconnected nanofibers ensuring short transport length for electrons, well-dispersed CuO quantum dots leading to highly utilization rate, and good mechanical properties resulting in strong electrode integrity."

Among all proposed anode materials for sodium-ion batteries, antimony is a desirable candidate due to its high theoretical capacity (660 mA h g–1). Herein, an antimony/multilayer graphene hybrid, in which antimony is homogeneously anchored on multilayer graphene, is produced by a confined vapor deposition method. The chemical bonding can realize robust and intimate contact between antimony and multilayer graphene, and the uniform distribution of antimony and the highly conductive and flexible multilayer graphene can not only improve sodium ion diffusion and electronic transport but also stabilize the solid electrolyte interphase upon the large volume changes of antimony during cycling.

WS2 NWs with very thin diameter of ≈25 nm and expanded interlayer spacing of 0.83 nm were prepared by using a facile solvothermal method followed by a heat treatment. The as-prepared WS2 NWs were evaluated as anode materials of SIBs in two potential windows of 0.01-2.5 V and 0.5-3 V. WS2 NWs displayed a remarkable capacity (605.3 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) ) but with irreversible conversion reaction in the potential window of 0.01-2.5 V. In comparison, WS2 NWs showed a reversible intercalation mechanism in the potential window of 0.5-3 V, in which the nanowire-framework is well maintained. In the latter case, the interlayers of WS2 are gradually expanded and exfoliated during repeated charge-discharge cycling. This not only provides more active sites and open channels for the intercalation of Na(+) but also facilitates the electronic and ionic diffusion. Therefore, WS2 NWs exhibited an ultra-long cycle life with high capacity and rate capability in the potential window of 0.5-3 V. This study shows that WS2 NWs are promising as the anode materials of room-temperature SIBs."

The pyrolytic carbon shows very high reversible sodium storage capacities up to 430.5 mA h g−1 at a current density of 30 mA g−1 and superior cycling stability with only 2.5% capacity loss over 200 charge–discharge cycles.

Due to its low raw material cost, non-toxicity and potentially high charge-storage capacity pyrite (FeS2) is a highly promising material for such next-generation batteries. In this work we present the electrochemical performance of FeS2 nanocrystals (NCs) as lithium-ion and sodium-ion storage materials. First, we show that nanoscopic FeS2 is a promising lithium-ion cathode material, delivering a capacity of 715 mA h g(-1) and average energy density of 1237 Wh kg(-1) for 100 cycles, twice higher than for commonly used LiCoO2 cathodes. Then we demonstrate, for the first time, that FeS2 NCs can serve as highly reversible sodium-ion anode material with long cycling life. As sodium-ion anode material, FeS2 NCs provide capacities above 500 mA h g(-1) for 400 cycles at a current rate of 1000 mA g(-1). In all our tests and control experiments, the performance of chemically synthesized nanoscale FeS2 clearly surpasses bulk FeS2 as well as large number of other nanostructured metal sulfides."

The obtained SnS2/graphene nanocomposite delivers a remarkable capacity as high as 650 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 200 mA g(-1). More impressively, the capacity can reach 326 mA h g(-1) even at 4000 mA g(-1) and remains stable at ∼610 mA h g(-1) without fading up to 300 cycles when the rate is brought back to 200 mA g(-1). The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the synergetic effects between the ultrasmall SnS2 and the highly conductive graphene network. The unique structure can simultaneously facilitate Na(+) ion diffusion, provide more reaction sites, and suppress aggregation and volume fluctuation of the active materials during prolonged cycling."

However, the poor cycling performance and unsatisfactory rate capability of existing anodes hinder the development of sodium-ion batteries. Here we fabricate a sandwich-like cobalt sulfide–reduced graphene oxide (CoS/rGO) composite using a hydrothermal method as the anode material for sodium ion batteries. According to the SEM analysis, CoS nanoparticles anchor on both sides of the reduced graphene oxide nanosheets in such a way that the nanoporous structure with a large amount of void spaces can be prepared. And the cycling performance of the sandwich-like CoS/rGO composite is drastically enhanced compared with that of the bare CoS nanoparticles. After 100 cycles, the discharge capacity of CoS/rGO still remains at 230 mA h g−1, while the specific capacity of the bare CoS nanoparticles at the first cycle is 601 mA h g−1, dropping rapidly to 68 mA h g−1 after only 40 cycles. Furthermore, CoS/rGO gives an excellent rate capability even up to a large current of 2 A g−1. It is noted that the synergistic effect between CoS and graphene can contribute to the improved electrochemical performance."

        "abstract": "The paper reports a facile and cost effective method for fabricating sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles through using MoS2 sheets as the precursor by sodium-modification. The electrochemical performances of sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles are studied as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. The galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements have been performed in a voltage range of 0.01-2.6 V vs. Na(+)/Na under different current densities, using the as-prepared sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles as a working electrode. Typically, the initial discharge and charge capacities of sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles are 475 and 380 mA h g(-1), respectively, at a current density of 20 mA g(-1). The sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles exhibit high capacity with a reversible discharge capacity of about 190 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles. It should be emphasized that the discharge reaction consists of two steps which correspond to voltage plateaus of 0.93 V and 0.85 V vs. Na(+)/Na in the first discharge curve of the Na/MoS2 battery, respectively. But there is only one apparent voltage plateau in the Na/Na-Mo-S battery, and it reduces to below 0.5 V vs. Na(+)/Na, which can enhance the power density. All of the findings demonstrate that sodium molybdenum sulfide nanoparticles have steady cycling performance and environmental and cost friendliness as next generation secondary batteries."

        "title": "Niobium doped anatase TiO2 as an effective anode material for sodium-ion batteries",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries are considered to be a promising low-cost alternative to common lithium-ion batteries in the areas where specific energy is less critical. Among all the anode materials studied so far, TiO2 is very promising due to its low operating voltage, high capacity, nontoxicity, and low production cost. Herein, we present Nb-doped anatase TiO2 nanoparticles with high capacity, excellent cycling performance, and excellent rate capability. The optimized Nb-doped TiO2 anode delivers high reversible capacities of 177 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and 108.8 mA h g−1 at 5C, in contrast to 150.4 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and only 54.6 mA h g−1 at 5C for the pristine TiO2. The good performance is likely to be associated with enhanced conductivity and lattice expansion due to Nb doping. These results, in combination with its environmental friendliness and cost efficiency, render Nb-doped TiO2 a promising anode material for high-power sodium-ion batteries."

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have attracted extensive attention for large-scale energy storage applications for renewable energy and smart grids owing to their abundant sodium resources and potential low cost. Compared with the numerous available cathodes, very few anodes are viable for sodium-ion batteries. Here we report a highly safe and low-cost nanocomposite, disodium 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone (Na2C6H2O4)/CNT, prepared by a simple spray drying method, as a high performance anode for sodium-ion batteries. The resulting nanocomposite exhibits a reversible capacity of 259 mA h g−1 with a first Coulombic efficiency of 88% and excellent rate performance. The average sodium storage voltage is 1.4 V, which prevents the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase layer and consequently ensures high safety, high first Coulombic efficiency and superior rate performance."

        "abstract": "DOI: 10.1002/aenm.201502130 the limited content of Sb in the composites and the low capacity of carbon materials. Polymer binders that contain carboxyl groups and their derivatives, such as poly(acrylic acid) and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), have been reported to suppress suffi ciently the reduction of electrolytes and, therefore, to enable better electrochemical performances of anode materials for sodiumion batteries than the polymer binder of poly(vinylidene fl uoride) (PVDF). [ 25–28 ] However, the repeated volume change of alloy-type anodes during sodiation/desodiation reactions can induce sliding of the chains of linear polymer binders. As a result, irreversible deformations of the polymer chains occur repeatedly with the degradation of mechanical and electrical integrity of the electrode structures. The application of crosslinked polymer binders was previously demonstrated as an effi cient approach to accommodate the extreme volume change of silicon anodes in lithium-ion batteries during lithiation/ delithiation reactions. [ 29–36 ] Herein, a novel polymer network consisting of cross-linked chitosan was designed as a polymer binder to immobilize Sb particles in the anode for sodium-ion batteries. The cross-linked chitosan polymer network can effectively suppress the adverse mechanical effect from the large volume expansion and therefore enhance the electrochemical performance of the Sb anode in sodium-ion batteries. As the second most abundant polymer in nature after cellulose, chitin and its deacetylated derivative of chitosan, are carbohydrate-based linear polymers composed of randomly distributed β-(1-4)-linked D-glucosamine (deacetylated unit) and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (acetylated unit) ( Figure 1 A).

        "title": "Li4Ti5O12 nanosheets as high-rate and long-life anode materials for sodium-ion batteries",
        "abstract": "According to recent reports, a multiphase design can provide a new method to improve the performance of L4T5O12–TiO2 anodes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). But in the case of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), little attention is paid to the investigation of whether TiO2 phases have similar effects as they have in LIBs. In this paper, uniform pristine Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) and Li4Ti5O12–rutile TiO2 (LTO–RT) nanosheets were successfully fabricated on a large scale via a simple hydrothermal reaction. Their electrochemical performance as anodes for SIBs was carefully compared for the first time. The results show that the existence of TiO2 phases in LTO–TiO2 composites has a positive effect on the capacity but a negative effect on the cyclability as anodes for SIBs, which is very different from the previously reported effects of TiO2 phases in LTO–TiO2 composites as anodes for LIBs. Moreover, LTO nanosheets fabricated by our synthesis method deliver a reversible capacity up to 145 mA h g−1 at 1C and keep 91% capacity retention after 400 cycles. As far as we know, this is the longest cycle life to date for SIBs using LTO as anode materials. Based on a scan rate-dependent cyclic voltammetry test, a pseudocapacitive charge storage mechanism has been firstly proposed for Na-ion storage in a pristine LTO electrode, which contributes to the excellent rate capacity and such high cycling stability of LTO electrodes for SIBs."

        "title": "Carbon Encapsulated Tin Oxide Nanocomposites: An Efficient Anode for High Performance Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "The major obstacle in realizing sodium (Na)-ion batteries (NIBs) is the absence of suitable negative electrodes. This is because graphite, a commercially well known anode material for lithium-ion batteries, cannot be utilized as an insertion host for Na ions due to its large ionic size. In this study, a simple and cost-effective hydrothermal method to prepare carbon coated tin oxide (SnO2) nanostructures as an efficient anode material for NIBs was reported as a function of the solvent used. A single phase SnO2 resulted for the ethanol solvent, while a blend of SnO and SnO2 resulted for the DI water and ethylene glycol solvents. The elemental mapping in the transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of carbon coating on the SnO2 nanoparticles. In cell tests, the anodes of carbon coated SnO2 prepared in ethanol solvent exhibited stable cycling performance and attained a capacity of about 514 mAh g(-1) on the first charge. With the help of the conductive carbon coating, the SnO2 delivers more capacity at high rates: 304 mAh g(-1) at the 1 C rate, 213 mAh g(-1) at the 2 C rate and 133 mAh g(-1) at the 5 C rate. The excellent cyclability and high rate capability are the result of the formation of a mixed conducting network and uniform carbon coating on the SnO2 nanoparticles."

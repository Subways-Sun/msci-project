        "title": "Biphenylene network as sodium ion battery anode material.",
        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries possess several advantages for large-scale energy storage, such as low cost and enhanced safety. However, graphite or other anode materials are not satisfactory because the large radius of Na+ hinders their embedding and removal in the charge and discharge processes. Recently, a biphenylene network (BPN), a two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotrope, has been synthesized. In this paper, we reveal the potential possibility of BPN as a Na storage material. The theoretical results indicate the advantages of BPN as a sodium battery anode. The maximum specific capacity (413 mA h g-1) is larger than that of the graphite-Li system (372 mA h g-1). With low Na+ diffusion barrier (<0.6 eV) and small volume expansion in the charging process (∼26%), BPN presents superiority to the graphite-Na system. Our findings show new insights into Na storage in BPN and provide guidance for the use of a BPN anode in sodium ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Molybedenum disulfide (MoS2) is regarded as a promising anode material for next-generation sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to its high theoretical capacity. However, its low conductivity, large volume changes, and undesirable phase transformation hinder its practical applications. In this study, we synthesize a hierarchically designed core-shell heterostructure based on nitrogen-doped MoS2/C and silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) (N-MoS2/C@SiOC) via the facile pyrolysis of a suspension of an N-MoS2/polyfurfural precursor in silicone oil. The in situ nitrogen doping in a two-dimensional MoS2 structure with carbon incorporation leads to the enlargement of the interlayer spacing and enhancement of the electronic conductivity and mechanical stability, which allows the facile, highly reversible insertion and extraction of sodium ions upon cycling. Further, the nanoscale SiOC shell with surface capacitive reactivity provides a conductive pathway, preventing unfavorable side reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface and acting as a structure-reinforcing buffer against severe volume expansion issues. As a result, the N-MoS2/C@SiOC composite exhibits high reversible capacity (540.7 mAh g-1), high-capacity retention (>100% after 200 cycles), and excellent rate capability up to 10 A g-1. The simple hierarchical core-shell design strategy developed in this study allows for the fabrication of high-performance metal sulfide anodes as well as other high-capacity anode materials for energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "SnS2 materials have attracted broad attention in the field of electrochemical energy storage due to its layered structure with high specific capacity. However, the easy restacking property during charge/discharge cycling would lead to electrode structure instability and serve capacity decrease. In this paper, we report a simple one-step hydrothermal synthesis of SnS2/graphene/SnS2 (SnS2/rGO/SnS2) composite with ultrathin SnS2 nanosheets covalently decorated on both sides of reduced graphene oxide sheets via C‒S bonds. Owing to the graphene sandwiched between two SnS2 sheets, the composite presents an enlarged interlayer spacing of ~8.03 Å for SnS2, which could facilitate the insertion/extraction of Li+/Na+ ion with rapid transport kinetics, as well as inhibiting the re-stacking of SnS2 nanosheets during the charge/discharge cycling. The density functional theory calculation reveals the most stable state of the moderate interlayer spacing for the sandwich-like composite. The diffusion coefficients of Li/Na-ions from both molecular simulation and experimental observation also demonstrate that that this state is the most suitable for fast ions transport. In addition, numerous ultra-tiny SnS2 nanoparticles anchored on the graphene sheets can generate dominant pseudocapacitive contribution to the composite especially at large current density, guaranteeing its excellent high-rate performance with 844 and 765 mAh g-1 for Li/Na-ion batteries even at 10 A g‒1. No distinct morphology changes occur after 200 cycles, and the SnS2 nanoparticles still recover to pristine phase without distinct agglomeration, demonstrate that this composite with high rate capabilities and excellent cycle stability are the promising candidate for lithium/sodium storage.",

Ultrathin and conformal TiO2 layers are used to modify the surface of MoS2 by atomic layer deposition.

The MoS2 nanosheets with 0.5-nm TiO2 coating electrode show the highest initial discharge capacity of 1392 mA h g-1 at 200 mA g-1, which is increased by 53% compared with that of bare MoS2. After 150 cycles, the capacity retention rate of the TiO2-coated MoS2 achieves 75.8% of its second cycle's capacity at 200 mA h g-1 in contrast to that of 59% of pure MoS2. Furthermore, the mechanism behind the experimental results is revealed by ex situ scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterizations, which confirms that the ultrathin TiO2 modifications can prevent the structural degradation and the formation of SEI film of MoS2 electrode.",

Switchgrass derived carbon materials intrinsically inherit its three-dimensional porous hierarchical architecture, with an average interlayer spacing of 0.376 nm.

        "abstract": "Maintaining structural stability is a great challenge for high-capacity conversion electrodes with large volume change but is necessary for the development of high-energy-density, long-cycling batteries. Here, we report a stable phosphorus anode for sodium ion batteries by the synergistic use of chemically bonded phosphorus-carbon nanotube (P-CNT) hybrid and cross-linked polymer binder. The P-CNT hybrid was synthesized through ball-milling of red phosphorus and carboxylic group functionalized carbon nanotubes. The P-O-C bonds formed in this process help maintain contact between phosphorus and CNTs, leading to a durable hybrid. In addition, cross-linked carboxymethyl cellulose-citric acid binder was used to form a robust electrode. As a result, this anode delivers a stable cycling capacity of 1586.2 mAh/g after 100 cycles, along with high initial Coulombic efficiency of 84.7% and subsequent cycling efficiency of ∼99%. The unique electrode framework through chemical bonding strategy reported here is potentially inspirable for other electrode materials with large volume change in use.",

        "abstract": "Cellulose is a promising natural bio-macromolecule due to its abundance, renewability and low cost. Here, a new method is developed to prepare pre-sodiated carbonaceous anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) from cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) under microwave irradiation for potential ultrafast and large-scale manufacturing. While direct carbonization of CNFs through microwave treatment is usually impossible due to the weak microwave absorption of CNFs, it is found that a small amount of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) can act as an effective initiator. Microwaving rGO releases extremely high energy, giving rise to local ultrahigh temperature as well as ultrahigh heating rate, which then induces the fast carbonization of CNFs and the production of pre-sodiated carbonaceous materials within seconds. The sodium in the carbonaceous materials, introduced from the carbonization of CNFs containing sodium-ion carboxyl, offer favorable spaces for sodiation/desodiation, which improves the electrochemical performance of the sodium-inserted carbonaceous anode. When the microwaved rGO-CNF (MrGO-CNF) is used as an anode for SIBs, a high initial capacity of 558 mAh g-1 is delivered and the capacity of 340 mAh g-1 remains after 200 cycles.

        "abstract": "We systematically investigated the potential of single-layer VS2 polytypes as Na-battery anode materials via density functional theory calculations. We found that sodiation tends to inhibit the 1H-to-1T structural phase transition, in contrast to lithiation-induced transition on monolayer MoS2. Thus, VS2 can have better structural stability in the cycles of charging and discharging. Diffussion of Na atom was found to be very fast on both polytypes, with very small diffusion barriers of 0.085 eV (1H) and 0.088 eV (1T). Ab initio random structure searching was performed in order to explore stable configurations of Na on VS2. Our search found that both the V top and the hexagonal center sites are preferred adsorption sites for Na, with the 1H phase showing a relatively stronger binding. Notably, our random structures search revealed that Na clusters can form as a stacked second layer at full Na concentration, which is not reported in earlier works wherein uniform, single-layer Na adsorption phases were assumed. With reasonably high specific energy capacity (232.91 and 116.45 mAh/g for 1H and 1T phases, respectively) and open-circuit voltage (1.30 and 1.42 V for 1H and 1T phases, respectively), VS2 is a promising alternative material for Na-ion battery anodes with great structural sturdiness. Finally, we have shown the capability of the ab initio random structure searching in the assessment of potential materials for energy storage applications.",

The SbNP@C electrode showed an initial total capacity of 422 mAh/gelectrode and retained 350 mAh/gelectrode after 300 deep charge-discharge cycles under 100 mA/gSb.

To overcome this problem, we reported a facile strategy to compensate the irreversible capacity loss of HC anodes simply by a chemical presodiation reaction of the HC electrode with a sodiation reagent (sodium biphenyl, Na-Bp). Benefiting from the strong sodiation ability of Na-Bp, HC anode can be presodiated rapidly in a very short time and the presodiated HC (NaxHC) is found to have a desirable ICE of 100%. When coupled with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode to build a SIB full cell, the NaxHC||Na3V2(PO4)3 cell exhibit a high ICE of ~95.0% and an elevated energy density of 218 Wh kg-1, which is far superior to that of control cell using pristine HC anode (50% ICE and 120 Wh kg-1), suggesting great advantages brought by the chemical presodiation process.

However, SnO2-based anodes still cannot be used in practical sodium-ion batteries because they experience large volume changes during repetitive charge and discharge cycles. Such large volume changes lead to severe pulverization of the active material and loss of electrical contact between the SnO2 and carbon conductor, which in turn result in rapid capacity loss during cycling. Here, we introduce a new amorphous carbon-coated SnO2-electrodeposited porous carbon nanofiber (PCNF@SnO2@C) composite that not only has high sodium storage capability, but also maintains its structural integrity while ongoing repetitive cycles. Electrochemical results revealed that this SnO2-containing nanofiber composite anode had excellent electrochemical performance including high-capacity (374 mAh g(-1)), good capacity retention (82.7%), and large Coulombic efficiency (98.9% after 100th cycle).",

However, the DIBs based on sodium-ion electrolytes are seldom reported due to the lack of appropriate anode materials for reversible Na+ insertion/extraction. Herein, a new sodium-ion based DIB named as MoS2 /C-G DIB using penne-like MoS2 /C nanotube as anode and expanded graphite as cathode is constructed and optimized for the first time. The hierarchical MoS2 /C nanotube provides expanded (002) interlayer spacing of 2H-MoS2 , which facilitates fast Na+ insertion/extraction reaction kinetics, thus contributing to improved DIB performance. The MoS2 /C-G DIB delivers a reversible capacity of 65 mA h g-1 at 2 C in the voltage window of 1.0-4.0 V, with good cycling performance for 200 cycles and 85% capacity retention, indicating the feasibility of potential applications for sodium-ion based DIBs.",

        "abstract": "Red phosphorus (P) has attracted intense attention as promising anode material for high‐energy density sodium‐ion batteries (NIBs), owing to its high sodium storage theoretical capacity (2595 mAh g−1). Nevertheless, natural insulating property and large volume variation of red P during cycling result in extremely low electrochemical activity, leading to poor electrochemical performance. Herein, the authors demonstrate a rational strategy to improve sodium storage performance of red P by confining nanosized amorphous red P into zeolitic imidazolate framework‐8 (ZIF‐8) ‐derived nitrogen‐doped microporous carbon matrix (denoted as P@N‐MPC). When used as anode for NIBs, the P@N‐MPC composite displays a high reversible specific capacity of ≈600 mAh g−1 at 0.15 A g−1 and improved rate capacity (≈450 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 1000 cycles with an extremely low capacity fading rate of 0.02% per cycle). The superior sodium storage performance of the P@N‐MPC is mainly attributed to the novel structure. The N‐doped porous carbon with sub‐1 nm micropore facilitates the rapid diffusion of organic electrolyte ions and improves the conductivity of the encapsulated red P. Furthermore, the porous carbon matrix can buffer the volume change of red P during repeat sodiation/desodiation process, keeping the structure intact after long cycle life.",

Transmission electron microscopy images showed that Nb2O5 NCs with average particle size of 3 nm were uniformly deposited on rGO sheets and voids among Nb2O5 NCs existed. The architecture of ultrafine Nb2O5 NCs anchored on a highly conductive rGO network can not only enhance charge transfer and buffer the volume change during sodiation/desodiation process but also provide more active surface area for sodium ion storage, resulting in superior rate and cycle performance.

The electrode delivered a reversible capacity of 384.8 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1 and a good rate capability of 221.9 mA h g-1, even at 1 A g-1. Its electrochemical performance is better than any anode material reported so far for PIBs. It was also found that the Sn4P3/C electrode displays a discharge potential plateau of 0.1 V in PIBs, slightly higher than for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) (0.01 V), and well above the plating potential of metal. This diminishes the formation of dendrites during cycling, and thus Sn4P3 is a relatively safe anode material, especially for application in large-scale energy storage, where large amounts of electrode materials are used. Furthermore, a possible reaction mechanism of the Sn4P3/C composite as PIB anode is proposed.

The all‐around encapsulation (plane‐to‐plane contact) architecture that provides a large interface between N‐graphene and SnSb nanocrystal not only effectively enhances the electron conductivity and structural integrity of the overall electrode, but also offers excess interfacial sodium storage, thus leading to much enhanced high‐rate sodium storage capacity and stability, which has been proven by both experimental results and first‐principles simulations.

        "abstract": "Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2 ), a 2D-layered compound, is regarded as a promising anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its attractive theoretical capacity and low cost. The main challenges associated with MoS2 are the low rate capability suffering from the sluggish kinetics of Na+ intercalation and the poor cycling stability owning to the stack of MoS2 sheets. In this work, a unique architecture of bundled defect-rich MoS2 (BD-MoS2 ) that consists of MoS2 with large vacancies bundled by ultrathin MoO3 is achieved via a facile quenching process. When employed as anode for a SIB, the BD-MoS2 electrode exhibits an ultrafast charge/discharge due to the pseudocapacitive-controlled Na+ storage mechanism in it. Further experimental and theoretical calculations show that Na+ is able to cross the MoS2 layer by vacancies, not only limited to diffusion along the layer, thus realizing a 3D Na+ diffusion with faster kinetics.

        "abstract": "Sodium is globally available, which makes a sodium-ion rechargeable battery preferable to a lithium-ion battery for large-scale storage of electrical energy, provided a host cathode for Na can be found that provides the necessary capacity, voltage, and cycle life at the prescribed charge/discharge rate. Low-cost hexacyanometallates are promising cathodes because of their ease of synthesis and rigid open framework that enables fast Na(+) insertion and extraction. Here we report an intriguing effect of interstitial H2O on the structure and electrochemical properties of sodium manganese(II) hexacyanoferrates(II) with the nominal composition Na2MnFe(CN)6·zH2O (Na2-δMnHFC). The newly discovered dehydrated Na2-δMnHFC phase exhibits superior electrochemical performance compared to other reported Na-ion cathode materials; it delivers at 3.5 V a reversible capacity of 150 mAh g(-1) in a sodium half cell and 140 mAh g(-1) in a full cell with a hard-carbon anode. At a charge/discharge rate of 20 C, the half-cell capacity is 120 mAh g(-1), and at 0.7 C, the cell exhibits 75% capacity retention after 500 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Antimony- (Sb) based materials have been considered as one of promising anodes for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high theoretical capacities and appropriate sodium inserting potentials. So far, the reported energy density and cycling stability of the Sb-based anodes for SIBs are quite limited and need to be significantly improved. Here, we develop a novel Sb/C hybrid encapsulating the Sb nanorods into highly conductive N and S codoped carbon (Sb@(N, S-C)) frameworks. As an anode for SIBs, the Sb@(N, S-C) hybrid maintains high reversible capacities of 621.1 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 150 cycles, and 390.8 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 1000 cycles. At higher current densities of 2, 5, and 10 A g-1, the Sb@(N, S-C) hybrid also can display high reversible capacities of 534.4, 430.8, and 374.7 mAh g-1, respectively. Such impressive sodium storage properties are mainly attributed to the unique cross-linked carbon networks providing highly conductive frameworks for fast transfer of ions and electrons, alleviating the volume expansion and preventing the agglomeration of Sb nanorods during the cycling.",

However, the large volume variation during electrochemical cycling makes it difficult to use for practical applications. Herein, the reversible performance of BP in SIB is significantly enhanced by bridging covalently functionalized BP on graphene. The enhanced interaction between the chemical functionalized BP and graphene improves the stability of BP during long-cycle running of SIB. The bridging reduces the surface energy and increases thickness of BP available for enlarging the channel between BP nanosheet and graphene. The enlarged channel stores more sodium ions for improving cycle performance. Significantly, two types of phosphorus-carbon bond are first detected during experimental analysis. Benefiting from the strategy, the BP-based SIB anode exhibits 1472 mAh g-1 specific capacity at 0.1 A g-1 in the 50th cycle and 650 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 200 cycles.",

Phosphorus (P) is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries, with a theoretical capacity of 2596 mAh/g. The red phosphorus (RP) form has worse electronic conductivity and lower initial Coulombic efficiency than black phosphorus (BP), but high material cost and limited production capacity have slowed the development of BP anodes. To address these challenges, we have developed a simple and scalable method to synthesize layered BP/graphene composite (BP/rGO) by pressurization at room temperature. A carbon-black-free and binder-free BP/rGO anode prepared with this method achieved specific charge capacities of 1460.1, 1401.2, 1377.6, 1339.7, 1277.8, 1123.78, and 720.8 mAh/g in a rate capability test at charge and discharge current densities of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, and 40 A/g, respectively.

The physical and electrochemical compatibilities of the TMP electrolyte are investigated by igniting, ionic conductivity, cyclic voltammetry, and charge–discharge measurements.

Up to the present, the anode material still remains a great challenge for the application of SIBs, especially at room temperature. Graphite has an obvious limitation to store larger radius sodium ions (Na+) in comparison with lithium ions (Li+), while the hard carbon with large interlayer distance can demonstrate a relatively high storage capability and durable cycle life. However, the disadvantages of low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) mainly caused by large surface area and high cost synthetic approach hinder its practical applications. Herein, a new coupled carbonization strategy is presented to prepare a cost-effective hard carbon material by pyrolyzing and carbonizing the mixture of abundant sucrose and phenolic resin. Benefiting from the specialized pyrolysis reaction process and optimized conditions as studied in detail, the hard carbon has an extremely low surface area of 1.54 m2 g-1 and high initial Coulombic efficiency of 87%, which have been rarely reported before and enhance the utilization efficiency of Na+ consumption within the cathode in the future. More importantly, the hard carbon, with a high interlayer distance 3.95 Å, can deliver a higher capacity of 319 mAh g-1 and maintain a finer capacity retention of 90% over 150 cycles. Besides, a full cell with the configuration of as-prepared hard carbon anode versus an air-stable O3-Na0.9[Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48]O2 cathode is further presented, and it has a high ICE of 80% and energy density of 256 Wh kganode-1 (vs hard carbon) with reliable cycle performance.

        "abstract": "With the increasing use of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), developing cost-effective anode materials, such as metal oxide, for Na-ion storage is one of the most attractive topics. Due to the obviously larger ion radius of Na than that of Li, most metal oxide electrode materials fail to exhibit the same high performance for SIBs like that of Li-ion batteries. Herein, iron oxide was employed to demonstrate a concept that rationally designing an amorphous structure should be useful to enhance Na-ion storage performance of a metal oxide. Amorphous Fe2O3/graphene composite nanosheets (Fe2O3@GNS) were successfully synthesized by a facile approach as anodes for SIBs. It reveals that amorphous Fe2O3 nanoparticles with an average diameter of 5 nm were uniformly anchored on the surface of graphene nanosheets by the strong C-O-Fe oxygen-bridge bond. Compared to well-crystalline Fe2O3, amorphous Fe2O3@GNS exhibited superior sodium storage properties such as high electrochemical activity, high initial Coulombic efficiency of 81.2%, and good rate performance. At a current density of 100 mA/g, amorphous Fe2O3@GNS composites show a specific capacity of 440 mAh/g, which is obviously higher than the specific capacity of 284 mAh/g of crystalline Fe2O3. Even at a high current density of 2 A/g, amorphous Fe2O3@GNS composites still exhibit a specific capacity as high as 219 mAh/g. The excellent electrochemical performance should be attributed to the amorphous structures of Fe2O3 as well as strongly interfacial interaction between Fe2O3 and GNS, which not only accommodate more electrochemical active sites and provide the more transmission channels for sodium ions but also benefit electron transfer as well as effectively buffer the volume change of host materials during sodiation and desodiation. This concept for designing amorphous iron oxide anodes for SIBs is also expected to facilitate preparation of various amorphous nanostructure of other metal oxides and improve their Na-ion storage performance.",

        "abstract": "Electrodes with higher Na + storage capability and cycling stability are vital to improve the energy density and rate capability of sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we present a coral-like FeP composite with FeP nanoparticles anchored and dispersed on a nitrogen-doped three-dimensional carbon framework ( FeP@NC ). Due to the highly continuous N-doped carbon framework and a spring-buffering graphitized carbon layer around the FeP nanoparticle, the sodium ion battery with FeP@NC composite can exhibit an ultra-stable cycling performance at 10 A g -1 with a capacity retention of 82.0% in 10000 cycles. More importantly, an interesting particle refinement achieving capacity increasing mechanism during cycling has been well confirmed. Particularly, the FeP nanoparticles go through a refining-recombination process during the first cycle and present a global refining trend after dozens of cycles, which results in a gradually increase in graphitization degree and interface magnetization, and further provides more extra active sites for Na + storage and contributes to a rising capacity with cycling . The capacity ascending phenomenon can also extend to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). This paper holds a new feasibility insight mechanism of the enhanced capacity during cycling and also offers a feasible solution to design high performance anode material for SIBs/LIBs.",

        "abstract": "Graphene‐based nanomaterials have sprung up as promising anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries due to the intriguing properties of graphene itself and the synergic effect between graphene and active materials. However, the 2D graphene sheet only allows the rapid diffusion of sodium ions along the parallel direction while that of the vertical direction is difficult, limiting the rate capability of graphene‐based electrode materials. To tackle this problem, pore‐forming engineering has been employed to perforate graphene and concurrently achieve the in situ growth of Co3Se4 nanoparticles. The generation of in‐plane nanohole breaks through the physical barriers of the graphene nanosheets, enabling the fast diffusion of electrolyte ions in the longitudinal direction. In addition, this design limits the aggregation of Co3Se4 nanoparticles because of the high affinity of Co3Se4 on graphene. Benefiting from the high conductivity and fast ion transport bestowed by the ingenious architecture, the Co3Se4/holey graphene exhibits a remarkable rate performance of 519.5 mAh g−1 at 5.0 A g−1 and desirable cycle stability. Conclusions drawn from this investigation are that the transport of sodium inside the graphene‐based composites is crucial for rate performance enhancement and this method is effective in modifying graphene‐based nanomaterials as potential anode materials.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are promising candidates for large-scale energy storage systems due to the abundance and wide distribution of sodium resources. Various solutions have been successfully applied to revolve the large-ion-size-induced battery issues at the mid-to-low current density range. However, the fast-charging properties of SIBs are still in high demand to accommodate the increasing energy needs at large to grid scales. Herein, a core-shell Co2VO4/carbon composite anode is designed to tackle the fast-charging problem of SIBs. The synergetic effect from the stable spinel structure of Co2VO4, the size of the nanospheres, and the carbon shell provide enhanced Na+ ion diffusion and electron transfer rates and outstanding electrochemical performance. With an ultrahigh current density of 5 A g-1, the Co2VO4@C anode achieved a capacity of 135.1 mAh g-1 and a >98% capacity retention after 2000 cycles through a pseudocapacitive dominant process.

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (NIB, NAB, SIB) are attracting interest as a potentially lower cost alternative to lithium ion batteries (LIB), with readily available and geographically democratic reserves of the metal. Tin is one of most promising SIB anode materials, which alloys with up to 3.75 Na, leading to a charge storage capacity of 847 mAh g(-1). In this Account, we outline the state-of-the-art understanding regarding the sodiation-induced phase transformations and the associated performance in a range of Sn-based systems, treating metallic Sn and its alloys, tin oxide (SnO2), tin sulfide (SnS2/SnS), and tin phosphide (Sn4P3). We first detail what is known about the sodiation sequence in metallic Sn, highlighting the most recent insight into the reactions prior to the terminal equilibrium Na15Sn4 intermetallic. We explain why researchers argue that the equilibrium (phase diagram) series of phase transitions does not occur in this system, and rather why sodiation/desodiation proceeds through a series of metastable crystalline and amorphous structures. We also outline the recent modeling-based insight regarding how this phase transition profoundly influences the mechanical properties of the alloy, progressively changing the bonding and the near neighbor arrangement from \"Sn-like\" to \"Na-like\" in the process. We then go on to discuss the sodiation reactions in SnO2. We argue that while a substantial amount of experimental work already exists where the focus is on synthesis and testing of tin oxide-based nanocomposites, the exact sodiation sequence is just beginning to be understood. Unlike in Sn and Sn alloys, where capacities near the theoretical are reached at least early during cycling, SnO2 never quite achieves anything close to the 1398 mAh g(-1) that would be possible with a combination of fully reversible conversion and alloying reactions. We highlight recent work demonstrating that contrary to general expectations, it is the Sn to Na15Sn4 alloying reaction that is incomplete and hence limits the capacity of the electrode. We also describe how the oxide conversion reaction goes through an intermediate SnO phase, and how its reversibility in a half-cell is highly dependent on the terminal anodic voltage. We then present what is known about sodiation of tin sulfide and of tin phosphide phases, including emerging microstructural evidence that may explain why both the sulfides and the phosphides are unable to achieve their highly promising theoretical capacities under conventional electrode testing conditions. Finally, we provide a broad comparison of the capacity (cycling and rate) performance for a range of Sn based anode materials, and show that there may be indeed an optimum microstructural architecture.",

To compensate the shortage of energy density, the most accessible solution is developing a high-voltage anode-free configuration composing a lightweight Al current collector on the anode and a high-voltage sodiumized cathode. However, it imposes stringent Na reversibility and high-voltage stability requirements on the electrolyte. Upon the request, a 3A zeolite molecular sieve film is rationally designed, and a highly aggregated solvation structure is constructed through the size effect. It successfully suppresses trace but continuous oxidative decomposition and extends the oxidative stability to 4.5 V without sacrificing the Na reversibility of the anode (99.91%). Therefore, we harvest anode-free cells with high energy density of 369 and 372 W h kg-1 for 4.0 and 4.25 V class cells, respectively. Furthermore, this strategy enables a long lifespan (250 cycles) for 4.0 V-class anode-free cells and a substantially reduced cost in a sustainable way.",

First-principle calculations reveal that the Na2S/Na2Se interface possesses the lowest diffusion energy barrier (0.39 eV) of Na among three kinds of interface structures (Na2O/Na2S, Na2O/Na2Se, and Na2S/Na2Se) due to its smallest recorded interface deformation, similar electronegativity, and lattice constant.

Moreover, the benefits at deep-discharge conditions can be further promoted by an ultrathin Al2O3 coating. A series of measurements show that the OVs increase the electric conductivity and Na-ion diffusion coefficient, and the promotion from ultrathin coating lies in the effective reduction of cycling-induced solid-electrolyte interphase.

        "abstract": "Structural phase transitions can be used to alter the properties of a material without adding any additional elements and are therefore of significant technological value. It was found that the hexagonal-SnS2 phase can be transformed into the orthorhombic-SnS phase after an annealing step in an argon atmosphere, and the thus transformed SnS shows enhanced sodium-ion storage performance over that of the SnS2, which is attributed to its structural advantages. Here, we provide the first report on a SnS@graphene architecture for application as a sodium-ion battery anode, which is built from two-dimensional SnS and graphene nanosheets as complementary building blocks. The as-prepared SnS@graphene hybrid nanostructured composite delivers an excellent specific capacity of 940 mAh g(-1)and impressive rate capability of 492 and 308 mAh g(-1) after 250 cycles at the current densities of 810 and 7290 mA g(-1), respectively. The performance was found to be much better than those of most reported anode materials for Na-ion batteries. On the basis of combined ex situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and ex situ X-ray diffraction, the formation mechanism of SnS@graphene and the synergistic Na-storage reactions of SnS in the anode are discussed in detail. The SnS experienced a two-structural-phase transformation mechanism (orthorhombic-SnS to cubic-Sn to orthorhombic-Na3.75Sn), while the SnS2 experienced a three-structural-phase transformation mechanism (hexagonal-SnS2 to tetragonal-Sn to orthorhombic-Na3.75Sn) during the sodiation process. The lesser structural changes of SnS during the conversion are expected to lead to good structural stability and excellent cycling stability in its sodium-ion battery performance. These results demonstrate that the SnS@graphene architecture offers unique characteristics suitable for high-performance energy storage application.",

Here, we propose a new strategy to enable high-capacity utilization and cycle stability of hard carbon anodes in the nonflammable phosphate electrolyte by using low-cost Na+ salt with a high molar ratio of salt/solvent combined with an solid electrolyte interphase film-forming additive. As a result, the carbon anode in the trimethyl phosphate (TMP) electrolyte with a high molar ratio of [NaClO4]/[TMP] and 5% fluoroethylene carbonate additive demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 238 mAh g-1, considerable rate capability, and long-term cycling life with 84% capacity retention over 1500 cycles.

        "abstract": "Transition metal oxides can be considered as appealing candidates for sodium ion battery anode materials because these low-cost materials possess high capacity and enhanced safety. However, the practical application of these materials is usually limited by their low electronic conductivity and serious volume change during the charging-discharging process. Herein, we report the fabrication of 3D-0D graphene-Fe3O4 quantum dot hybrids by a facile one-pot hydrothermal approach as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Fe3O4 quantum dots with an average size of 4.9 nm are anchored on the surface of 3D structured graphene nanosheets homogeneously. Such unique hierarchical structure are advantageous for enlarging the electrode/electrolyte interface area and enhancing the electrochemical activity of the hybrid materials, inhibiting particle aggregation of Fe3O4 and accommodating their volume change during the charging-discharging process as well as enabling fast diffusion of electrons and rapid transfer of electrolyte ions. Consequently, the 3D-0D graphene-Fe3O4 quantum dot hybrids exhibit ultrahigh sodium storage capacity (525 mAh g-1 at 30 mA g-1), outstanding cycling stability (312 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles at 50 mA g-1) and superior rate performance (56 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1).",

        "abstract": "Electrochemical conversion reactions of metal oxides provide a new avenue to build high capacity anodes for sodium-ion batteries. However, the poor rate performance and cyclability of these conversion anodes remain a significant challenge for Na-ion battery applications because most of the conversion anodes suffer from sluggish kinetics and irreversible structural change during cycles. In this paper, we report an Fe2O3 single crystallites/reduced graphene oxide composite (Fe2O3/rGO), where the Fe2O3 single crystallites with a particle size of ∼300 nm were uniformly anchored on the rGO nanosheets, which provide a highly conductive framework to facilitate electron transport and a flexible matrix to buffer the volume change of the material during cycling. This Fe2O3/rGO composite anode shows a very high reversible capacity of 610 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1, a high Coulombic efficiency of 71% at the first cycle, and a strong cyclability with 82% capacity retention after 100 cycles, suggesting a potential feasibility for sodium-ion batteries. More significantly, the present work clearly illustrates that an electrochemical conversion anode can be made with high capacity utilization, strong rate capability, and stable cyclability through appropriately tailoring the lattice structure, particle size, and electronic conduction channels for a simple transition-metal oxide, thus offering abundant selections for development of low-cost and high-performance Na-storage electrodes.",

Excellent cycling stability is also observed at an even higher charge-discharge rate. A high reversible capacity of 149 mAh g(-1) also can be obtained at a current rate of 500 mA g(-1) (2C). The good Na-ion insertion property is attributed to the short diffusion distance in the HCNWs and the large interlayer distance (0.37 nm) between the graphitic sheets, which agrees with the interlayered distance predicted by theoretical calculations to enable Na-ion insertion in carbon materials.",

To overcome these drawbacks, we synthesized electrospun TiO2/C nanofibers, where anatase TiO2 nanocrystals with a diameter of ∼12 nm were densely embedded in the conductive carbon fibers, thus preventing them from aggregating and attacking by electrolyte. Due to its abundant active surfaces of well-dispersed TiO2 nanocrytals and high electronic conductivity of the carbon matrix, the TiO2/C anode shows a high redox capacity of ∼302.4 mA h g(-1) and a high-rate capability of 164.9 mAh g(-1) at a very high current of 2000 mA g(-1). More significantly, this TiO2/C anode can be cycled with nearly 100% capacity retention over 1000 cycles, showing a sufficiently long cycle life for battery applications.

However, poor cycling stability, low rate capability and unclear electrochemical reaction mechanism are the main challenges for MoS2 anode in Na-ion batteries. In this study, molybdenum disulfide/carbon (MoS2 /C) nanospheres are fabricated and used for Na-ion battery anodes. MoS2 /C nanospheres deliver a reversible capacity of 520 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and maintain at 400 mAh g(-1) for 300 cycles at a high current density of 1 C, demonstrating the best cycling performance of MoS2 for Na-ion batteries to date. The high capacity is attributed to the short ion and electron diffusion pathway, which enables fast charge transfer and low concentration polarization. The stable cycling performance and high coulombic efficiency (∼100%) of MoS2 /C nanospheres are ascribed to (1) highly reversible conversion reaction of MoS2 during sodiation/desodiation as evidenced by ex-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and (2) the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer in fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) based electrolyte as demonstrated by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements.",

Transmission electron microscope images confirm that SnSb nanoparticles with an average size of about 20-30 nm are uniformly dispersed on the RGO surfaces. When they were used as anodes for rechargeable sodium (Na)-ion batteries, these as-synthesized RGO-SnSb nanocomposite anodes delivered a high initial reversible capacity of 407 mAh g(-1), stable cyclic retention for more than 80 cycles and excellent cycle stability at ultra high charge/discharge rates up to 30C. The significantly improved performance of the synthesized RGO-SnSb nanocomposites as Na-ion battery anodes can be attributed to the synergetic effects of RGO-based flexible framework and the nanoscale dimension of the SnSb alloy particles (<30 nm). Nanosized intermetallic SnSb compounds can exhibit improved structural stability and conductivity during charge and discharge reactions compared to the corresponding individuals (Sn and Sb particles). In the meantime, RGO sheets can tightly anchor SnSb alloy particles on the surfaces, which can not only effectively suppress the agglomeration of SnSb particles but also maintain excellent electronic conduction. Furthermore, the mechanical flexibility of the RGO phase can accommodate the volume expansion and contraction of SnSb particles during the prolonged cycling, therefore, improve the electrode integrity mechanically and electronically. All of these contribute to the electrochemical performance improvements of the RGO-SnSb nanocomposite-based electrodes in rechargeable Na-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Water‐in‐salt (WiS) electrolytes provide a new pathway to widen the electrochemical window of aqueous electrolytes. However, their formulation strongly depends on the solubility of the chosen salts, imposing a stringent restriction on the number of possible WiS systems. This issue becomes more severe for aqueous Na‐ion batteries (ANIBs) owing to the relatively lower solubility of sodium salts compared to its alkaline cousins (Li, K, and Cs). A new class of the inert‐cation‐assisted WiS (IC‐WiS) electrolytes containing the tetraethylammonium (TEA+) inert cation is reported. The Na IC‐WiS electrolyte at a superhigh concentration of 31 mol kg–1 exhibits a wide electrochemical window of 3.3 V, suppresses transition metal dissolution from the cathode, and ensures singular intercalation of Na into both cathode and anode electrodes during cycling, which is often problematic in mixed alkali cation systems such as K–Na and Li–Na. Owing to these unique advantages of the IC‐WiS electrolyte, the NaTiOPO4 anode and Prussian blue analog Na1.88Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.97·1.35H2O cathode can be coupled to construct a full ANIB, delivering an average voltage of 1.74 V and a high energy density of 71 Wh kg−1 with a capacity retention of 90% after 200 cycles at 0.25C and of 76% over 800 cycles at 1C.",

        "abstract": "Despite the high specific capacity and low redox potential of alkali metals, their practical application as anodes is still limited by the inherent dendrite‐growth problem. The fusible sodium–potassium (Na–K) liquid metal alloy is an alternative that detours this drawback, but the fundamental understanding of charge transport in this binary electroactive alloy anode remains elusive. Here, comprehensive characterization, accompanied with density function theory (DFT) calculations, jointly expound the Na–K anode‐based battery working mechanism. With the organic cathode sodium rhodizonate dibasic (SR) that has negligible selectivity toward cations, the charge carrier is screened by electrolytes due to the selective ionic pathways in the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Stable cycling for this Na–K/SR battery is achieved with capacity retention per cycle to be 99.88% as a sodium‐ion battery (SIB) and 99.70% as a potassium‐ion battery (PIB) for over 100 cycles. Benefitting from the flexibility of the liquid metal and the specially designed carbon nanofiber (CNF)/SR layer‐by‐layer cathode, a flexible dendrite‐free alkali‐ion battery is achieved with an ultrahigh areal capacity of 2.1 mAh cm−2. Computation‐guided materials selection, characterization‐supported mechanistic understanding, and self‐validating battery performance collectively promise the prospect of a high‐performance, dendrite‐free, and versatile organic‐based liquid metal battery.",

The conventional SICs design is based on battery-like anode and capacitive cathode, in which the battery-like anode materials involve various reactions such as inserted reaction, alloying reaction and conversion reaction, and the capacitive cathode materials usually depend on activated carbon (AC). However, researchers attempted to construct SICs based on battery-like cathode and capacitive anode or a combination of both in recent years. Here, the charge storage mechanism and material design strategies in SICs are summarized, with a focus on battery-like anode materials from inorganic to organic materials. Additionally, the challenges in the fabrication of SICs and future research directions are discussed.",

        "abstract": "While sodium metal anodes (SMAs) feature many performance advantages in sodium ion batteries (SIBs), severe safety concerns remain for using bulk sodium electrodes. Herein, a 3D Ag@C natrophilic substrate prepared by a facile thermal evaporation deposition method, which can be employed as a much safer \"anode-free\" SMA, is reported. Initially, there is no bulk sodium on the Ag@C substrate in the assembled SIBs. Upon charging, sodium will be uniformly deposited onto the Ag@C substrate and afterwards functions as a real SMA, thus inheriting the intrinsic merits of SMA and enhancing safety simultaneously. While cycling, the as-synthesized substrate demonstrates superior sodium plating/stripping cycling stability at 1, 2 and 3 mA cm-2 with a capacity of 2 mAh cm-2 . Theoretical simulations reveal that Na ions prefer to bind with Ag and form a Na-Ag network, thus clearly revealing uniform sodium deposition on the Ag@C substrate. More importantly, a full battery based on Ag@C and Prussian white with impressive Coulomb efficiency (CE), high rate capability (from 0.1 C to 5 C) and long-term cycling life is illustrated for the first time, thus making Ag@C feasible for the establishment of \"anode-free\" SIBs with reduced cost, high gravimetric/volumetric energy density and enhanced safety.",

        "abstract": "Bismuth (Bi) have been demonstrated as promising anode for Na-ion batteries (NIBs) because it has high gravimetry (386 mAh g-1) and volumetric capacity (3800 mAh cm-3). However, Bi suffers from large volume expansion during sodiation, leading to poor electrochemical performance. Construction nanostructure with sufficient void space to accommodate the volume change has been proven effective for achieving prolonged cycling stability. But the excessive void space will definitely decrease the volumetric energy density of battery. Herein, we design an optimized Bi@Void@C nanospheres (Bi@Void@C-2) with yolk-shell structure that exhibits the best cycling performance and enhanced volumetric energy density. The optimized void space could not only buffer the volume change of the Bi nanosphere, but also could keep the high volumetric energy density of battery. The Bi@Void@C-2 shows an excellent rate capacity of 173 mAh g-1 at ultra-high current density of 100 A g-1 and long-cycle life (198 mAh g-1 at 20A g-1 over 10000 cycles). The origin of the superior performance is achieved through in-depth fundamental studies during battery operation using in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and in-situ transmission electron microscope (TEM), complemented by theoretical calculations and ex-situ TEM observation. Our rational design provides insights for anode materials with large volume variation, especially for conversion type and alloying type mechanism materials for batteries (i.e. Li-ion batteries, Na-ion batteries).",

        "abstract": "Rechargeable battery systems, including Li-ion batteries and Na-ion batteries, have attracted great interest in energy storage because of their high energy density, low cost, efficient energy storage and suitable redox potential. Nevertheless, their rapid development is still greatly hampered by some typical constraints including low coulombic efficiency, large volume changes and severe particle agglomeration and pulverization during the charge-discharge process. Here, we fabricate a few-layer MoSe2 confined within a ZnSe-C hollow porous sphere nanocomposite through a simple self-assembly strategy followed by selenization, which efficiently circumvents these problems. The fabricated ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode demonstrates diverse advantages, including the existence of a few-layer structure, an in situ porous carbon matrix, multicomponent coordination and excellent pseudocapacitive behavior. When used as an anode material, it displays extraordinarily attractive electrochemical performance for both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The reversible capacity of ZnSe/MoSe2@C for LIBs reaches as high as 1051 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 (150 cycles). A long-term high-rate cycling test reveals an excellent stability of 524 mA h g-1 at 4 A g-1 after 600 cycles. In addition, for SIBs, ZnSe/MoSe2@C also manifests a high initial coulombic efficiency of 89% at 0.2 A g-1 and a remarkable reversible capacity of 381 mA h g-1 at a high current density of 4 A g-1 even after 250 cycles with negligible capacity loss. This is one of the best performances of ZnSe-based anode materials for SIBs reported so far. The regulation strategy reported in the present work is expected to offer new insights into the fabrication of high performance anode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted considerable attention due to the intrinsic safety and high abundance of sodium. However, the lack of high-performance anode materials becomes a main obstacle for the development of SIBs. Here, we identify an ideal anode material, a metallic TiC3 monolayer with not only remarkably high storage capacity of 1278 mA h g-1 but also low barrier energy and open-circuit voltage, through first-principles swarm-intelligence structure calculations. TiC3 still keeps metallic after adsorbing two-layer Na atoms, ensuring good electrical conductivity during the battery cycle. Besides, high melting point and superior dynamical stability are in favor of practical application. Its excellent performance can be mainly attributed to the presence of an unusual n-biphenyl unit in the TiC3 monolayer. High cohesive energy, originating from multibonding coexistence (e.g., covalent, ionic, and metal bonds) in the TiC3 monolayer, provides strong feasibility for experimental synthesis. In comparison with TiC3, functionalized TiC3 with oxygen shows a higher storage capacity; meanwhile, it keeps nearly the same barrier energy. This is in sharp contrast with metal-rich MXenes. These intriguing properties make the TiC3 monolayer a promising anode material for SIBs.",

To make up for the lost sodium-ion, pre-sodiation treatments have been applied, which are effective ways to mitigate the low initial efficiency. Here, we developed a direct-contact method to achieve the pre-sodiation for cathode and anode electrodes and demonstrated the enhanced coulombic efficiency of the first cycle with improved cyclability and reversible capacity. Moreover, we proved the formation of a thick passivation layer at the cathode-electrolyte interface during the pre-sodiation process; this contributes to the improved cycle stability by preventing the dissolution of the active material and its deposition on the anode surface. The direct-contact method is a simple and cost-effective way to complete pre-sodiation, and this simple process will be widely applicable for practical battery manufacturing.",

However, Sn anodes suffer from a rapid capacity fading during cycling due to pulverization induced by severe volume changes. Here we innovatively synthesized pipe-wire TiO2-Sn@carbon nanofibers (TiO2-Sn@CNFs) via electrospinning and atomic layer deposition to suppress pulverization-induced capacity decay. In pipe-wire TiO2-Sn@CNFs paper, nano-Sn is uniformly dispersed in carbon nanofibers, which not only act as a buffer material to prevent pulverization, but also serve as a conductive matrix. In addition, TiO2 pipe as the protection shell outside of Sn@carbon nanofibers can restrain the volume variation to prevent Sn from aggregation and pulverization during cycling, thus increasing the Coulombic efficiency. The pipe-wire TiO2-Sn@CNFs show excellent electrochemical performance as anodes for both LIBs and NIBs. It exhibits a high and stable capacity of 643 mA h/g at 200 mA/g after 1100 cycles in LIBs and 413 mA h/g at 100 mA/g after 400 cycles in NIBs.

High capacity anode materials, such as phosphorus, have been explored to realize Na-ion battery technologies that offer comparable performances to their Li-ion counterparts. While P anodes provide unparalleled capacities, the mechanism of sodiation and desodiation is not well-understood, limiting further optimization. Here, we use a combined experimental and theoretical approach to provide molecular-level insight into the (de)sodiation pathways in black P anodes for sodium-ion batteries. A determination of the P binding in these materials was achieved by comparing to structure models created via species swapping, ab initio random structure searching, and a genetic algorithm. During sodiation, analysis of 31P chemical shift anisotropies in NMR data reveals P helices and P at the end of chains as the primary structural components in amorphous Na xP phases. X-ray diffraction data in conjunction with variable field 23Na magic-angle spinning NMR support the formation of a new Na3P crystal structure (predicted using density-functional theory) on sodiation. During desodiation, P helices are re-formed in the amorphous intermediates, albeit with increased disorder, yet emphasizing the pervasive nature of this motif. The pristine material is not re-formed at the end of desodiation and may be linked to the irreversibility observed in the Na-P system.",

However, their poor cycling stability and rate performance hinder their further development. To avoid these issues, In2S3 into Sb2S3 is introduced to improve its electrochemical properties by optimizing its crystal structure and sodium storage mechanism. A heterostructure composed of In2S3 and Sb2S3 shows a unique morphology of formicary microspheres, which provide abundant channels for fast transfer of sodium ions, large surface area for a high pseudocapacitance effect, and enough voids to relieve volume expansion. A sodium‐ion battery containing the bimetallic sulfide anode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 400 mA h g−1 and long cycle life of about 1000 cycles. Similarly, a high capacity of ≈610 mA h g−1 is achieved for a lithium‐ion battery containing the anode. During sodiation/desodiation, the synergistic effect of In2S3 and Sb2S3 enhances electronic conductivity and supports the host structure, preventing collapse. The cycling performance and rate performance of the In2S3–Sb2S3 anode are further improved by wrapping the electrode with carbon nanotubes.

        "abstract": "Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets were synthesized by a modified Hummer's method without additional reducing procedures, such as chemical and thermal treatment, by appropriate drying of graphite oxide under ambient atmosphere. The use of a moderate drying temperature (250°C) led to mesoporous characteristics with enhanced electrochemical activity, as confirmed by electron microscopy and N2 adsorption studies. The dimensions of the sheets ranged from nanometres to micrometres and these sheets were entangled with each other. These morphological features of rGO tend to facilitate the movement of guest ions larger than Li+. Impressive electrochemical properties were achieved with the rGO electrodes using various charge-transfer ions, such as Li+, Na+ and K+, along with high porosity. Notably, the feasibility of this system as the carbonaceous anode material for sodium battery systems is demonstrated. Furthermore, the results also suggest that the high-rate capability of the present rGO electrode can pave the way for improving the full cell characteristics, especially for preventing the potential drop in sodium-ion batteries and potassium-ion batteries, which are expected to replace the lithium-ion battery system",

Currently, the development of anode materials for PIBs is still confronted with many serious problems, such as low capacity and poor cycling performance. In this work, sheet-like MoSe2 implanted on the surfaces of carbon nanofibers is successfully synthesized through a simple electrospinning and selenization route. MoSe2/C-700 (selenization at 700 °C) maintains high structural stability and facilitates the intercalation/deintercalation of K+, which benefits from one-dimensional nanofibers with good structural stability and MoSe2 with an expanded interlayer spacing. As a whole, MoSe2/C-700 as an anode for PIBs shows a high reversible capacity of 316 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 over 100 cycles. It also displays a specific capacity of 81 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 over 100 cycles when it first serves as an electrode material for nonaqueous potassium-based battery-supercapacitor hybrid (BSH) devices.",

Based on the average voltage and migration barrier of surface ions, we suggest that M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, and Mo are suitable for sodium ion battery (SIB) anodes. These screened M2C materials can provide a theoretical capacity of 190-288 mA h g(-1) by accommodating two alkali ions per formula unit.

Nb2 O5 is one typical model anode material with promising high-rate lithium storage.

In this work, partially surface-amorphized and defect-rich black niobium oxide@graphene (black Nb2 O5- x @rGO) nanosheets are designed to overcome the above Na/K storage problems. The black Nb2 O5- x @rGO nanosheets electrodes deliver a high-rate Na and K storage capacity (123 and 73 mAh g-1 , respectively at 3 A g-1 ) with long-term cycling stability. Besides, both Na-ion and K-ion full batteries based on black Nb2 O5- x @rGO nanosheets anodes and vanadate-based cathodes (Na0.33 V2 O5 and K0.5 V2 O5 for Na-ion and K-ion full batteries, respectively) demonstrate promising rate and cycling performance. Notably, the K-ion full battery delivers higher energy and power densities (172 Wh Kg-1 and 430 W Kg-1 ), comparable to those reported in state-of-the-art K-ion full batteries, accompanying with a capacity retention of ≈81.3% over 270 cycles.

Here we investigate an anode consisting of tin nanoparticles (SnNPs) with an ALD-Al2O3 coating. For the first time, in situ transmission electron microscopy unveiled the dynamic mechanical protection of the ALD-Al2O3 coating by coherently deforming with the SnNPs under the huge volume changes during charging/discharging. Battery tests in coin-cells further showed the ALD-Al2O3 coating remarkably boosts the cycling performance of the Sn anodes, comparing with those made of bare SnNPs. Chemomechanical simulations clearly revealed that a bare SnNP debonds and falls off the underlying substrate upon charging, and by contrast the ALD-Al2O3 coating, like ion-conductive nanoglue, robustly anchors the SnNP anode to the substrate during charging/discharging, a key to improving battery cycle performance.",

        "abstract": "Polymerization-induced phase separation of nanoparticle-filled solution is demonstrated as a simple approach to control the structure of porous composites. These composites are subsequently demonstrated as the active component for sodium ion battery anode. To synthesize the composites, we dissolved/dispersed titanium oxide (anatase) nanoparticles (for sodium insertion) and poly(hydroxybutyl methacrylate) (PHBMA, porogen) in furfuryl alcohol (carbon precursor) containing a photoacid generator (PAG). UV exposure converts the PAG to a strong acid that catalyzes the furfuryl alcohol polymerization. This polymerization simultaneously decreases the miscibility of the PHBMA and reduces the mobility in the mixture to kinetically trap the phase separation. Carbonization of this polymer composite yields a porous nanocomposite. This nanocomposite exhibits nearly 3-fold greater gravimetric capacity in Na-ion batteries than the same titanium oxide nanoparticles that have been coated with carbon. This improved performance is attributed to the morphology as the carbon content in the composite is five times that of the coated nanoparticles. The porous composite materials exhibit stable cyclic performance. Moreover, the battery performance using materials from this polymerization-induced phase separation method is reproducible (capacity within 10% batch-to-batch). This simple fabrication methodology may be extendable to other systems and provides a facile route to generate reproducible hierarchical porous morphology that can be beneficial in energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "Potassium has its unique advantages over lithium or sodium as a charge carrier in rechargeable batteries. However, progresses in K-ion battery (KIB) chemistry have so far been hindered by lacking suitable electrode materials to host the relatively large K+ ions compared to its Li+ and Na+ counterparts. Herein, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2 ) \"roses\" grown on reduced graphene oxide sheets (MoS2 @rGO) are synthesized via a two-step solvothermal route. The as-synthesized MoS2 @rGO composite, with expanded interlayer spacing of MoS2 , chemically bonded between MoS2 and rGO, and a unique nano-architecture, displays the one of the best electrochemical performances to date as an anode material for nonaqueous KIBs. More importantly, a combined K+ storage mechanism of intercalation and conversion reaction is also revealed. The findings presented indicate the enormous potential of layered metal dichalcogenides as advanced electrode materials for high-performance KIBs and also provide new insights and understanding of K+ storage mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Na‐metal batteries are considered as the promising alternative candidate for Li‐ion battery beneficial from the wide availability and low cost of sodium, high theoretical specific capacity, and high energy density based on the plating/stripping processes and lowest electrochemical potential. For Na‐metal batteries, the crucial problem on metallic Na is one of the biggest challenges. Mossy or dendritic growth of Na occurs in the repetitive Na stripping/plating process with an unstable solid electrolyte interphase layer of nonuniform ionic flux, which can not only lead to the low Coulombic efficiency, but also can create short circuit risks, resulting in possible burning or explosion. In this communication, the atomic layer deposition of Al2O3 coating is first demonstrated for the protection of metallic Na anode for Na‐metal batteries. By protecting Na foil with ultrathin Al2O3 layer, the dendrites and mossy Na formation have been effectively suppressed and lifetime has been significantly improved. Furthermore, the thickness of protective layer has been further optimized with 25 cycles of Al2O3 layer presenting the best performance over 500 cycles. The novel design of atomic layer deposition protected metal Na anode may bring in new opportunities to the realization of the next‐generation high energy‐density Na metal batteries.",

The novel electrolyte combination developed here circumvents the dendritic Na deposition that is one of the primary concerns for battery safety and constructs the uniform ionic interlayer achieving highly reversible Na plating/stripping reactions.

        "abstract": "Developing advanced anodes for sodium ion batteries is still challenging. In this work, Fe-doped three-dimensional (3D) cauliflower-like rutile TiO2 was successfully synthesized by a facile hydrolysis method followed by a low-temperature annealing process. The influence of Fe content on the structure, morphology, and electrochemical performance was systematically investigated. When utilized as a sodium ion battery anode, 6.99%-Fe-doped TiO2 exhibited the best electrochemical performance. This sample delivered a very high reversible capacity (327.1 mAh g-1 at 16.8 mA g-1) and superior rate performance (160.5 mAh g-1 at 840 mA g-1), as well as long-term cycling stability (no capacity fading at 1680 mA g-1 over 3000 cycles). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with experimental results indicated that the significantly improved sodium storage ability of the Fe-doped sample should be mainly due to the increased oxygen vacancies, narrowed band gap, and lowered sodiation energy barrier, which enabled much higher electronic/ionic conductivities and more favorable sodium ion intercalation into rutile TiO2.",

Such a statistical approach, combined with prolonged galvanostatic cycling and density functional theory analysis, allows identifying anatase at high growth time as the TiO2 polymorph of choice as an anode material, thus creating a benchmark for sodium-ion batteries, which currently took the center stage of the research in the field of energy storage systems from renewables.",

        "abstract": "Na battery chemistries show poor passivation behavior of low voltage Na storage compounds and Na metal with organic carbonate-based electrolytes adopted from Li-ion batteries. Therefore, a suitable electrolyte remains a major challenge for establishing Na batteries.

For a DME/NaFSI ratio of 2, a stable passivation of anode materials was found owing to the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface, which was characterized spectroscopically. This permitted non-dentritic Na metal cycling with approximately 98 % coulombic efficiency as shown for up to 300 cycles. The NaFSI/DME electrolyte may enable Na-metal anodes and allows for more reliable assessment of electrode materials in Na-ion half-cells, as is demonstrated by comparing half-cell cycling of hard carbon anodes and Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 cathodes with a widely used carbonate and the NaFSI/DME electrolyte.",

Silicon has shown some promise for replacing graphite because of its exceptional capacity, but the dramatic volume change during lithiation-delithiation processes often leads to failure. Jin et al. developed a composite that is made of black phosphorous and graphite in its core and covered with swollen polyaniline. In contrast to previous efforts, bonding between the carbon and phosphorous allows for a high charging rate without sacrifices in capacity and cycling stability. Science, this issue p. 192 Black phosphorus composites with engineered interfaces deliver high capacity, high rate capability, and long cycle life. High-rate lithium (Li) ion batteries that can be charged in minutes and store enough energy for a 350-mile driving range are highly desired for all-electric vehicles. A high charging rate usually leads to sacrifices in capacity and cycling stability. We report use of black phosphorus (BP) as the active anode for high-rate, high-capacity Li storage. The formation of covalent bonds with graphitic carbon restrains edge reconstruction in layered BP particles to ensure open edges for fast Li+ entry; the coating of the covalently bonded BP-graphite particles with electrolyte-swollen polyaniline yields a stable solid–electrolyte interphase and inhibits the continuous growth of poorly conducting Li fluorides and carbonates to ensure efficient Li+ transport.

ALD is known to improve the cycling performance, Coulombic efficiency of batteries, and maintain electrode integrity. Here, the electrochemical performance of uncoated P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 electrodes is compared to that of ALD-coated Al2O3 P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 electrodes. Given that ALD coatings are in the early stage of development for NIB cathode materials, little is known about how ALD coatings, in particular aluminum oxide (Al2O3), affect the electrode-electrolyte interface. Therefore, full characterizations of its effects are presented in this work. For the first time, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to elucidate the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on ALD-coated electrodes. It contains less carbonate species and more inorganic species, which allows for fast Na kinetics, resulting in significant increase in Coulombic efficiency and decrease in cathode impedance. The effectiveness of Al2O3 ALD coating is also surprisingly reflected in the enhanced mechanical stability of the particle which prevents particle exfoliation.",

In this work, porous hollow Co3O4 with N-doped carbon coating (Co3O4/N-C) polyhedrons have been prepared using cobalt-based MOFs as a sacrificial template. Assembled from tiny nanoparticles and N-doped carbon coating, Co3O4/N-C composite shortens the diffusion length of Li+/Na+ ions and possesses an enhanced conductivity. And the porous and hollow structure is also beneficial for tolerating volume changes in the galvanostatic discharge/charge cycles as lithium/sodium battery anode materials. As a result, it can exhibit impressive cycling and rating performance. At 1000 mA g-1, the specific capacities maintaine stable values of ∼620 mAh g-1 within 2000 cycles as anodes in lithium ion battery, while the specific capacity keeps at 229 mAh g-1 within 150 cycles as sodium ion battery anode. Our work shows comparable cycling performance in lithium ion battery but even better high-rate cycling stability as sodium ion battery anode. Herein, we provide a facile method to construct high electrochemical performance oxide/N-C composite electrode using new MOFs as sacrificial template.",

        "abstract": "Superoxide based metal-air (or metal-oxygen) batteries, including potassium and sodium-oxygen batteries, have emerged as promising alternative chemistries in the metal-air battery family because of much improved round-trip efficiencies (>90%). In order to improve the cycle life of these batteries, it is crucial to understand and control the side reactions between the electrodes and the electrolyte. For potassium-oxygen batteries using ether-based electrolytes, the side reactions on the potassium anode have been identified as the main cause of battery failure. The composition of the side products formed on the anode, including some reaction intermediates, have been identified and quantified. Combined experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show the side reactions are likely driven by the interaction of potassium with ether molecules and the crossover of oxygen from the cathode. To inhibit these side reactions, the incorporation of a polymeric potassium ion selective membrane (Nafion-K(+)) as a battery separator is demonstrated that significantly improves the battery cycle life. The K-O2 battery with the Nafion-K(+) separator can be discharged and charged for more than 40 cycles without increases in charging overpotential.",

        "abstract": "High-energy sodium-ion batteries have a significant prospective application as a next-generation energy storage technology. However, this technology is severely hindered by the lack of large-scale production of battery materials. Herein, a self-standing film, assembled with SnS-Sn/multiwalled carbon nanotubes encapsulated in carbon fibers (SnS-Sn/MCNTs@CFs), is prepared using ball milling and electrospinning techniques and used as sodium-ion battery anodes. To compensate the poor internal conductivity of SnS-Sn nanoparticles, MCNTs are used to interweave SnS-Sn nanoparticles to improve the conductivity. Moreover, the designed three-dimensional carbon fiber conductive network can effectively shorten the diffusion path of electron/Na+, accelerate the reaction kinetics, and provide abundant active sites for sodium absorption. Benefiting from these unique features, the self-standing film offers a high reversible capacity of 568 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and excellent cycling stability at 1 A g-1 with a reversible capacity of 359.3 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles. In the sodium-ion full cell device, the capacity is stable at 283.7 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at a current of 100 mA g-1.

The development of advanced carbon anodes with high Na‐storage capacity and initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) from low cost, resources abundant precursors is critical for SIBs. Here, a carbon microcrystalline hybridization route to synthesize hard carbons with extensive pseudo‐graphitic regions from lignite coal with the assistance of sucrose is proposed. Employing the cross‐linked interaction between sucrose and lignite coal to generate carbon‐based hybrid microcrystalline states, the obtained hard carbons possess pseudo‐graphitic dominant phases with large interlayer spaces that facilitate Na ion's storage and transportation, as well as fewer surface defects that guarantee high ICE. The LCS‐73 with an optimum cross‐link demonstrates the highest Na‐storage capacity of 356 mAh g−1 and an ICE of 82.9%. The corresponding full‐cell delivers a high energy density of 240 Wh kg−1 (based on the mass of anode and cathode materials) and excellent rate capability of 106 mAh g−1 at 10 C in addition to outstanding cycle performance with 80% retention over 500 cycles at 2 C.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries operating at room temperature have emerged as a generation of energy storage devices to replace lithium-ion batteries; however, they are limited by a lack of anode materials with both an adequate lifespan and excellent rate capability. To address this issue, we developed Nb2CTx MXene-framework MoS2 nanosheets coated with carbon (Nb2CTx@MoS2@C) and constructed a robust three-dimensional cross-linked structure. In such a design, highly conductive Nb2CTx MXene nanosheets prevent the restacking of MoS2 sheets and provide efficient channels for charge transfer and diffusion. Additionally, the hierarchical carbon coating has a certain level of volume elasticity and excellent electrical conductivity to guarantee the intercalation of sodium ions, facilitating both fast kinetics and long-term stability. As a result, the Nb2CTx@MoS2@C anode delivers an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 530 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 200 cycles and very long cycling stability with a capacity of 403 mA h g-1 and only 0.01% degradation per cycle for 2000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1. Moreover, this anode has an outstanding capacity retention rate of approximately 88.4% from 0.1 to 1 A g-1 in regard to rate performance. Most importantly, the Nb2CTx@MoS2@C anode can realize a quick charge and discharge at current densities of 20 or even 40 A g-1 with capacities of 340 and 260 mAh g-1, respectively, which will increase the number of practical applications for sodium-ion batteries.",

An exquisite hierarchical heterogeneous of bimetal sulfide Sb2S3@FeS2 hollow nanorods embedded into nitrogen-doped carbon matrix is fabricated by a concise two-steps of solvothermal method. The FeS2 interlayer bulges in-situ grow on the interface of hollow Sb2S3 nanorods within the nitrogen-doped graphene matrix, forming a delicate heterostructure. Such a well-designed architecture affords rapid Na+ diffusion and improves charge transfer at the heterointerfaces. Meanwhile, the strongly synergistic coupling interaction among the interior Sb2S3, interlayer FeS2, and external nitrogen-doped carbon matrix creates a steady nanostructure, which extremely accelerates the electronic/ion transport and effectively alleviates the volume expansion upon long cyclic process. As a result, the composite, as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries, exhibits superior rate capability of 537.9 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1, excellent cyclic stability with 85.7 % capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 5 A g-1. Based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculation, the existing constructing heterojunction in this composite can not only optimize the electronic structure to enhance the conductivity, but also favor the Na2S adsorption energy to accelerate the reaction kinetics.

Nevertheless, they suffer from volume expansion, polyselenide dissolution, and sluggish kinetics, which lead to inadequate conversion reaction toward sodium and poor reversibility during the desodiation process. Therefore, the transition-metal selenides are far from long cycling stability, outstanding rate performance, and high initial Coulombic efficiency, which are the major challenges for practical application in SIBs. Here, an efficient anode material including an FeSe2 core and N-doped carbon shell with inner void space as well as high conductivity is developed for outstanding rate performance and long cycle life SIBs. In the ingeniously designed FeSe2@NC microrods, the N-doped carbon shell can facilitate mass transport/electron transfer, protect the FeSe2 core from the electrolyte, and accommodate volume variation of FeSe2 with the help of the inner void of the core. Thus, the FeSe2@NC microrods can maintain strong structural integrity upon long cycling and ensure a good reversible conversion reaction of FeSe2 during the discharge/charge process. As a result, the as-prepared FeSe2@NC microrods exhibit excellent sodium storage performance and ultrahigh stability, achieving an excellent rate capability (411 mAh g-1 at 10.0 A g-1) and a long-term cycle performance (401.3 mAh g-1 after 2000 cycles at 5.0 A g-1).",

Herein, we report that the Na+ solvation structure, particularly the type and location of the anions, plays a critical role in determining the Na anode performance. We show that the low CE results from anion-mediated corrosion, which can be tackled readily through tuning the anion interaction at the electrolyte/anode interface. Our strategy thus enables fast charging Na-ion and Na-S batteries with remarkable cycle-life. The presented insights differ from the prevailing interpretation that the failure mechanism mostly results from sodium dendrite growth and/or solid electrolyte interphase formation.

        "abstract": "Low electrical conductivity severely limits the application of Fe2O3 in lithium- and sodium-ion batteries. In respect of this, we design and fabricate Fe2O3/Fe3O4 nano-aggregates anchored on nitrogen-doped graphene as an anode for sodium-ion batteries with the assistance of microwave plasma. The highly conductive Fe3O4 in the composite can function as a highway of electron transport, and the voids and phase boundaries in the Fe2O3/Fe3O4 heterostructure facilitate Na+ ion diffusion into the nano-aggregates. Furthermore, the Fe–O–C bonds between the nano-aggregates and graphene not only stabilize the structural integrity, but also enhance the charge transfer. Consequently, the Fe2O3/Fe3O4/NG anode exhibits specific capacity up to 362 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1, excellent rate capability, and stable long-term cycling performance. This multi-component-based heterostructure design can be used in anode materials for lithium- and sodium-ion batteries, and potential opens a new path for energy storage electrodes.",

        "abstract": "Heteroatom‐doped carbon materials with expanded interlayer distance have been widely studied as anodes for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, it remains unexplored to further enlarge the interlayer spacing and reveal the influence of heteroatom doping on carbon nanostructures for developing more efficient SIB anode materials. Here, a series of N‐rich few‐layer graphene (N‐FLG) with tuneable interlayer distance ranging from 0.45 to 0.51 nm is successfully synthesized by annealing graphitic carbon nitride (g‐C3N4) under zinc catalysis and selected temperature (T = 700, 800, and 900 °C). More significantly, the correlation between N dopants and interlayer distance of resultant N‐FLG‐T highlights the effect of pyrrolic N on the enlargement of graphene interlayer spacing, due to its stronger electrostatic repulsion. As a consequence, N‐FLG‐800 achieves the optimal properties in terms of interlayer spacing, nitrogen configuration and electronic conductivity. When used as an anode for SIBs, N‐FLG‐800 shows remarkable Na+ storage performance with ultrahigh rate capability (56.6 mAh g−1 at 40 A g−1) and excellent long‐term stability (211.3 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 after 2000 cycles), demonstrating the effectiveness of material design.",

        "abstract": "Research on sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) has recently been revitalized due to the unique features of much lower costs and comparable energy/power density to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), which holds great potential for grid-level energy storage systems. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are considered as promising anode candidates for SIBs with high theoretical capacity, while their intrinsic low electrical conductivity and large volume expansion upon Na+ intercalation raise the challenging issues of poor cycle stability and inferior rate performance. Herein, the designed formation of hybrid nanoboxes composed of carbon-protected CoSe2 nanoparticles anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon hollow skeletons (denoted as CoSe2 @C∩NC) via a template-assisted refluxing process followed by conventional selenization treatment is reported, which exhibits tremendously enhanced electrochemical performance when applied as the anode for SIBs. Specifically, it can deliver a high reversible specific capacity of 324 mAh g-1 at current density of 0.1 A g-1 after 200 cycles and exhibit outstanding high rate cycling stability at the rate of 5 A g-1 over 2000 cycles.

        "abstract": "Developing anodes with high and stable energy density for both gravimetric and volumetric storage is vital for high-performance lithium/sodium-ion batteries. Herein, an SnSe/FLG (few-layer graphene) composite with high tap density (2.3 g cm-3) is synthesized via plasma milling method, in which SnSe nanoparticles are strongly bound with the FLG matrix, owing to both Sn-C and Se-C bonds, to form nanosized primary particles and then assemble to microsized secondary granules. The FLG can effectively alleviate the large stress generated from volume expansion of SnSe during cycling, based on its superstrength. Furthermore, as demonstrated by the density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, the Sn-C and Se-C co-bonding benefitting from the formation of substantial vacancy defects on the P-milling synthesized FLG enables strong affinity between SnSe nanoparticles and FLG matrix, preventing SnSe from aggregating and detaching even after long-term cycling. As anode for lithium-ion batteries, it exhibits high gravimetric and volumetric capacity (864.8 mAh g-1 and 1990 mAh cm-3 at 0.2 A g-1), high rate (612.6 mAh g-1 even at 5.0 A g-1) and the longest life among the reported SnSe-based anodes (capacity retention of 92.8% after 2000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1). Subsequently, impressive cyclic life (capacity retention of 91.6% after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1) is also achieved for sodium-ion batteries.

        "abstract": "Although studies of transition metal sulfides (TMS) as anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries are extensively reported, the short cycle life is still a thorny problem that impedes their practical application. In this work, a new capacity fading mechanism of the TMS electrodes is demonstrated; that is, the parasitic reaction between electrolyte anions (i.e., ClO4−) and metal sulfides yields non‐conductive and unstable solid‐electrolyte interphase (SEI) and meanwhile, corrosively turns metal sulfides into less‐active oxides. This knowledge guides the development of an electrochemical strategy to manipulate the anion decomposition and construct a stable interface that prevents extensive parasitic reactions. It is shown that introducing sodium nitrate to the electrolyte radically changes the Na+ solvation structure by populating nitrate ions in the first solvation sheath, generating a stable and conductive SEI layer containing both Na3N and NaF. The optimized interface enables an iron sulfide anode to stably cycle for over 2000 cycles with negligible capacity loss, and a similar enhancement in cycle performance is demonstrated on a number of other metal sulfides. This work discloses metal sulfides’ cycling failure mechanism from a unique perspective and highlights the critical importance of manipulating the interface chemistry in sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Room-temperature sodium-ion batteries have been regarded as promising candidates for grid-scale energy storage due to their low cost and the wide distribution of sodium sources. The main scientific challenge for their practical application is to develop suitable anodes with long-term cycling stability and high rate capacity. Here, novel hierarchical three-dimensional porous carbon materials are synthesized through an in situ template carbonization process. Electrochemical examination demonstrates that carbonization temperature is a key factor that affects Na+-ion-storage performance, owing to the consequent differences in surface area, pore volume, and degree of crystallinity. The sample obtained at 600 °C delivers the best sodium-storage performance, including long-term cycling stability (15 000 cycles) and high rate capacity (126 mAh g-1 at 20 A g-1). Pseudocapacitive behavior in the Na+-ion-storage process has been confirmed and studied via cyclic voltammetry. Full cells based on the porous carbon anode and Na3V2(PO4)3-C cathode also deliver good cycling stability (400 cycles). Porous carbon, combining the merits of high energy density and extraordinary pseudocapacitive behavior after cycling stability, can be a promising replacement for battery/supercapacitors hybrid and suggest a design strategy for new energy-storage materials.",

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries are one of most promising alternatives to lithium ion batteries for large-scale energy storage, due to the high abundance and low cost of sodium in the earth. However, the lack of advanced electrode materials greatly affects their applications. Here, layered-structure SbPO4 is explored as an anode material for sodium ion batteries in terms of SbPO4 nanorods on reduced graphene oxide (SbPO4/rGO). In situ transmission electron microscopy images reveal the preferential expansion along the transverse direction of the nanorods upon the first discharging, which arises from the reduction of SbPO4 to Sb and the subsequent alloying of Sb as supported by in situ X-ray diffraction and selected area electron diffraction patterns. SbPO4/rGO exhibits a capacity retention of 99% after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g-1 both in half cells and in full cells. Its specific capacity at 5 A g-1 is 214 mA h g-1 in half cells or 134 mA h g-1 in full cells.

The present work demonstrates that single‐phase ternary cobalt phosphoselenide (CoPSe) in the form of nanoparticles embedded in a layered metal–organic framework (MOF)‐derived N‐doped carbon matrix (CoPSe/NC) represents an ultrastable and high‐rate anode material for SIBs/PIBs. The CoPSe/NC is fabricated by using the MOF as both a template and precursor, coupled with in situ synchronous phosphorization/selenization reactions. The CoPSe anode holds a set of intrinsic merits such as lower mechanical stress, enhanced reaction kinetics, as well as higher theoretical capacity and lower discharge voltage relative to its counterpart of CoSe2, and suppressed shuttle effect with higher intrinsic electrical conductivity relative to CoPS. The involved mechanisms are evidenced by substantial characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Consequently, the CoPSe/NC anode shows an outstanding long‐cycle stability and rate performance for SIBs and PIBs. Moreover, the CoPSe/NC‐based Na‐ion full cell can achieve a higher energy density of 274 Wh kg−1, surpassing that based on CoSe2/NC and most state‐of‐the‐art Na‐ion full cells based on P‐, Se‐, or S‐containing binary/ternary anodes to date.",

        "abstract": "We demonstrate that peat moss, a wild plant that covers 3% of the earth's surface, serves as an ideal precursor to create sodium ion battery (NIB) anodes with some of the most attractive electrochemical properties ever reported for carbonaceous materials. By inheriting the unique cellular structure of peat moss leaves, the resultant materials are composed of three-dimensional macroporous interconnected networks of carbon nanosheets (as thin as 60 nm). The peat moss tissue is highly cross-linked, being rich in lignin and hemicellulose, suppressing the nucleation of equilibrium graphite even at 1100 °C. Rather, the carbons form highly ordered pseudographitic arrays with substantially larger intergraphene spacing (0.388 nm) than graphite (c/2 = 0.3354 nm). XRD analysis demonstrates that this allows for significant Na intercalation to occur even below 0.2 V vs Na/Na(+). By also incorporating a mild (300 °C) air activation step, we introduce hierarchical micro- and mesoporosity that tremendously improves the high rate performance through facile electrolyte access and further reduced Na ion diffusion distances. The optimized structures (carbonization at 1100 °C + activation) result in a stable cycling capacity of 298 mAh g(-1) (after 10 cycles, 50 mA g(-1)), with ∼150 mAh g(-1) of charge accumulating between 0.1 and 0.001 V with negligible voltage hysteresis in that region, nearly 100% cycling Coulombic efficiency, and superb cycling retention and high rate capacity (255 mAh g(-1) at the 210th cycle, stable capacity of 203 mAh g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1)).",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) attract more attention because of sodium's abundant availability, affordable price, and potential to be an effective anode material. Meanwhile, carbon-based materials provide the most promising anode materials. Because of the large radius of sodium ions, SIBs do not exhibit favorable electrochemical performance. Introducing heteroatoms into the carbon-lattice is an effective strategy to enlarge the interlayer space of carbon-based materials which can improve carbon's electrochemical performance. In addition, anode materials with a surface-induced capacitive process can enhance the SIB's electrochemical performance because its capacitive process increases the kinetics of ion diffusion. Here, we describe an SIB's anode material containing nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene sheets [denoted as poly(2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole) (PDMcT)/reduced graphene oxide (RGO)] which are synthesized via carbonization of PDMcT polymerized on the surface of GO. PDMcT/RGO exhibited high capacities (240 mA h g-1 at 500 mA g-1), improved rate performance (144 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1), and good cycling stability (153 mA h g-1 after 5000 cycles at 5000 mA g-1). These unique results are attributed to the enlarged interlayer spacing and electronic conductivity from the heteroatoms which facilitate the sodium ion's insertion and electron transport. These results represent that PDMcT/RGO is a great potential anode material for SIBs.",

Not only can such unique porous crystal Si/amorphous SiO2 nanoparticles uniformly dispersed in the OMC matrix mitigate the volume change of active materials during the cycling process, but they can also improve electrical conductivity of Si/SiO2 and facilitate the Li+ /Na+ diffusion.

        "abstract": "Transition metal phosphides have been extensively investigated owing to their high theoretical capacities and relatively low intercalation potentials vs Li/Li+, but their practical applications have been hindered by low electrical conductivity and dramatic volume variation during cycling. In this work, an interesting strategy for the rational design of graphene (GR) encapsulated with a hollow FeP@carbon nanocomposite (H-FeP@C@GR) via a combination of a hydrothermal route, a carbon-coating process, phosphidation treatment, and carbothermic reaction is reported. The hollow FeP (H-FeP) nanospheres shelled with thin carbon layers are wonderfully incorporated into the GR matrix, interconnecting to form a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical architecture. Such a design offers distinct advantages for FeP-based anode materials for both lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium ion batteries (SIBs). For example, the 3D omnibearing conductive networks from the GR skeleton and outer coating carbon can provide an open freeway for electron/ion transport, promoting the electrode reaction kinetics. In addition, the wrapping of an H-FeP nanosphere in a thin carbon layer enables the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the carbon layer surface instead of on the individual H-FeP surface, preventing the continual re-forming of the SEI. When used as anode materials for LIBs and SIBs, H-FeP@C@GR exhibited excellent electrochemistry performances.",

        "abstract": "MnFe2O4 nanodots (∼3.3 nm) homogeneously dispersed in porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (denoted as MFO@C) were prepared by a feasible electrospinning technique. Meanwhile, MFO@C with the character of flexible free-standing membrane was directly used as binder- and current collector-free anode for sodium-ion batteries, exhibiting high electrochemical performance with high-rate capability (305 mA h g(-1) at 10000 mA g(-1) in comparison of 504 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1)) and ultralong cycling life (ca. 90% capacity retention after 4200 cycles). The Na-storage mechanism was systematically studied, revealing that MnFe2O4 is converted into metallic Mn and Fe after the first discharge (MnFe2O4 + 8Na(+) + 8e(-) → Mn + 2Fe + 4Na2O) and then to MnO and Fe2O3 during the following charge (Mn + 2Fe + 4Na2O → MnO + Fe2O3 + 8Na(+) + 8e(-)). The subsequent cycles occur through reversible redox reactions of MnO + Fe2O3 + 8Na(+) + 8e(-) ↔ Mn + 2Fe + 4Na2O, of which the reduction/oxidation of MnO/Mn takes place at a lower potential than that of Fe2O3/Fe. Furthermore, a soft package sodium-ion full battery with MFO@C anode and Na3V2(PO4)2F3/C cathode was assembled, delivering a stable capacity of ∼400 mA h g(-1) for MFO@C (with 100 cycles at 500 mA g(-1)) and a promising energy density of 77.8 Wh kg(-1) for the whole battery. This is owing to the distinctive structure of very-fine MnFe2O4 nanodots embedded in porous N-doped carbon nanofibers, which effectively improves the utilization rate of active materials, facilitates the transportation of electrons and Na(+) ions, and prevents the particle pulverization/agglomeration upon prolonged cycling.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries offer an attractive option for potential low cost and large scale energy storage due to the earth abundance of sodium. Red phosphorus is considered as a high capacity anode for sodium-ion batteries with a theoretical capacity of 2596 mAh/g. However, similar to silicon in lithium-ion batteries, several limitations, such as large volume expansion upon sodiation/desodiation and low electronic conductance, have severely limited the performance of red phosphorus anodes. In order to address the above challenges, we have developed a method to deposit red phosphorus nanodots densely and uniformly onto reduced graphene oxide sheets (P@RGO) to minimize the sodium ion diffusion length and the sodiation/desodiation stresses, and the RGO network also serves as electron pathway and creates free space to accommodate the volume variation of phosphorus particles. The resulted P@RGO flexible anode achieved 1165.4, 510.6, and 135.3 mAh/g specific charge capacity at 159.4, 31878.9, and 47818.3 mA/g charge/discharge current density in rate capability test, and a 914 mAh/g capacity after 300 deep cycles in cycling stability test at 1593.9 mA/g current density, which marks a significant performance improvement for red phosphorus anodes for sodium-ion chemistry and flexible power sources for wearable electronics.",

        "abstract": "Hydrazine-reduced graphite oxide and graphene oxide were synthesized to compare their performances as anode materials in lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries. Reduced graphite oxide inherits the layer structure of graphite, with an average spacing between neighboring layers (d-spacing) of 0.374 nm; this exceeds the d-spacing of graphite (0.335 nm). The larger d-spacing provides wider channels for transporting lithium ions and sodium ions in the material. We showed that reduced graphite oxide as an anode in lithium-ion batteries can reach a specific capacity of 917 mA h g-1, which is about three times of 372 mA h g-1, the value expected for the LiC6 structures on the electrode. This increase is consistent with the wider d-spacing, which enhances lithium intercalation and de-intercalation on the electrodes. The electrochemical performance of the lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries with reduced graphite oxide anodes show a noticeable improvement compared to those with reduced graphene oxide anodes. This improvement indicates that reduced graphite oxide, with larger interlayer spacing, has fewer defects and is thus more stable. In summary, we found that reduced graphite oxide may be a more favorable form of graphene for the fabrication of electrodes for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries and other energy storage devices.",

The as-achieved free-standing membrane constructed by pure Sb2Se3 nanowires exhibits good flexibility and integrity.

Besides the high working plateau at 2.1 V, another one is observed at approximately 0.4 V for the first time due to further reduction of Ti(3+) to Ti(2+). Remarkably, the anode exhibits superior rate capability, whose capacity and corresponding capacity retention reach 56 mAh g(-1) and 68%, respectively, over 10000 cycles under the high current density of 20 C rate (4 A g(-1)).

Herein, we present a simple microwave irradiation technique for obtaining few-layered, ultrathin two-dimensional SnS2 over graphene sheets in a few minutes. SnS2 possesses a large number of active surface sites and exhibits high-capacity, rapid sodium ion storage kinetics induced by quick, nondestructive pseudocapacitance. Enhanced sodium ion storage at a high current density (12 A g-1), accompanied by high reversibility and high stability, was demonstrated. Additionally, a rationally designed sodium ion full cell coupled with SnS2//Na3V2(PO4)3 exhibited exceptional performance with high initial Coulombic efficiency (99%), high capacity, high stability, and a retention of ∼53% of the initial capacity even after the current density was increased by a factor of 140. In addition, a high specific energy of ∼140 Wh kg-1 and an ultrahigh specific power of ∼8.3 kW kg-1 (based on the mass of both the anode and cathode) were observed. Because of its outstanding performance and rapid synthesis, few-layered SnS2 could be a promising candidate for practical realization of high-power SIBs.",

        "title": "Flower-like MoSe2 /C Composite with Expanded (0 0 2) Planes of Few-layer MoSe2 as the Anode for High-Performance Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have caught considerable attention in last few years owing to the abundance of sodium in comparison to lithium. The commercial graphite anode is demonstrated unsuitable as an anode material for SIBs due to the larger radius of Na+ ions, whereas the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) show great potential as anodes for SIBs because of their high achievable capacity. The sluggish kinetics, large volume expansion, and aggregation of those materials however results in severe decay of the electrochemical performance. In this work, a flower-like MoSe2 /C composite is synthesized with ethylenediamine and cassava starch (denoted as MoSe2 /Ccas ) and designed based on these principles: 1) expand the d-spacing of (0 0 2) planes of MoSe2 to enhance the kinetics for the intercalation-deintercalation of Na+ ions and 2) embed MoSe2 into the carbon matrix to enhance the conductivity and restrict the volume expansion and aggregation of MoSe2 . As a result, MoSe2 /Ccas exhibits superior cycle performance and rate capability for sodium storage. It shows durable long-life cycle capability with a reversible capacity of 360 mAh g-1 after 350 cycles at 0.5 Ag-1 . At the current density of 4 Ag-1 , the reversible capacity is still maintained at 266 mAh g-1 .",

In this paper, the preparation of CuO quantum dots (≈2 nm) delicately embedded in carbon nanofibers (denoted as 2-CuO@C) with a thin film via a feasible electrospinning method is reported. The CuO content can be controlled by altering the synthetic conditions and is optimized to 54 wt%. As binder-free anode for sodium ion batteries, 2-CuO@C delivers an initial reversible capacity of 528 mA h g-1 at the current density of 100 mA g-1 , an exceptional rate capability of 250 mA h g-1 at 5000 mA g-1 , and an ultra-stable capacity of 401 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 500 mA g-1 . The enhancement of electrochemical performance is attributed to the unique structure of 2-CuO@C, which offers a variety of advantages: highly conductive carbon matrix suppressing agglomeration of CuO grains, interconnected nanofibers ensuring short transport length for electrons, well-dispersed CuO quantum dots leading to highly utilization rate, and good mechanical properties resulting in strong electrode integrity.",

Moreover, the alloy anode displayed outstanding rate performance with ∼300 mAh g-1 sodiation capacity at 1 A g-1. The crystalline features of the melt-spun fibers aid in the exceptional electrochemical performance of the alloy anode. Further, the feasibility of the alloy anode for real-life applications was demonstrated in a sodium-ion full-cell configuration which could deliver a sodiation capacity of over 300 mAh g-1 (based on anode) at 50 mA g-1 with more than 99% Coulombic efficiency.

Among all proposed anode materials for SIBs, red phosphorus (P) is a very promising candidate because it has the highest theoretical capacity (∼2600 mAh/g). In this study, a red P-single-walled carbon nanotube (denoted as red P-SWCNT) composite, in which red P is uniformly distributed between tangled SWCNTs bundles, is fabricated by a modified vaporization-condensation method. Benefiting from the nondestructive preparation process, the highly conductive and mechanically strong SWCNT network is preserved, which enhances the conductivity of the composite and stabilizes the solid electrolyte interphase. As a result, the red P-SWCNT composite presents a high overall sodium storage capacity (∼700 mAh/gcomposite at 50 mA/gcomposite), fast rate capability (∼300 mAh/gcomposite at 2000 mA/gcomposite), and stable long-term cycling performance with 80% capacity retention after 2000 sodiation-desodiation cycles.

        "abstract": "Banana peel pseudographite (BPPG) offers superb dual functionality for sodium ion battery (NIB) and lithium ion battery (LIB) anodes. The materials possess low surface areas (19-217 m(2) g(-1)) and a relatively high electrode packing density (0.75 g cm(-3) vs ∼1 g cm(-3) for graphite). Tested against Na, BPPG delivers a gravimetric (and volumetric) capacity of 355 mAh g(-1) (by active material ∼700 mAh cm(-3), by electrode volume ∼270 mAh cm(-3)) after 10 cycles at 50 mA g(-1). A nearly flat ∼200 mAh g(-1) plateau that is below 0.1 V and a minimal charge/discharge voltage hysteresis make BPPG a direct electrochemical analogue to graphite but with Na. A charge capacity of 221 mAh g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1) is degraded by 7% after 600 cycles, while a capacity of 336 mAh g(-1) at 100 mAg(-1) is degraded by 11% after 300 cycles, in both cases with ∼100% cycling Coulombic efficiency. For LIB applications BPPG offers a gravimetric (volumetric) capacity of 1090 mAh g(-1) (by material ∼2200 mAh cm(-3), by electrode ∼900 mAh cm(-3)) at 50 mA g(-1). The reason that BPPG works so well for both NIBs and LIBs is that it uniquely contains three essential features: (a) dilated intergraphene spacing for Na intercalation at low voltages; (b) highly accessible near-surface nanopores for Li metal filling at low voltages; and (c) substantial defect content in the graphene planes for Li adsorption at higher voltages. The <0.1 V charge storage mechanism is fundamentally different for Na versus for Li. A combination of XRD and XPS demonstrates highly reversible Na intercalation rather than metal underpotential deposition. By contrast, the same analysis proves the presence of metallic Li in the pores, with intercalation being much less pronounced.",

Due to its low raw material cost, non-toxicity and potentially high charge-storage capacity pyrite (FeS2) is a highly promising material for such next-generation batteries. In this work we present the electrochemical performance of FeS2 nanocrystals (NCs) as lithium-ion and sodium-ion storage materials. First, we show that nanoscopic FeS2 is a promising lithium-ion cathode material, delivering a capacity of 715 mA h g(-1) and average energy density of 1237 Wh kg(-1) for 100 cycles, twice higher than for commonly used LiCoO2 cathodes. Then we demonstrate, for the first time, that FeS2 NCs can serve as highly reversible sodium-ion anode material with long cycling life. As sodium-ion anode material, FeS2 NCs provide capacities above 500 mA h g(-1) for 400 cycles at a current rate of 1000 mA g(-1). In all our tests and control experiments, the performance of chemically synthesized nanoscale FeS2 clearly surpasses bulk FeS2 as well as large number of other nanostructured metal sulfides.",

WS2 NWs with very thin diameter of ≈25 nm and expanded interlayer spacing of 0.83 nm were prepared by using a facile solvothermal method followed by a heat treatment. The as-prepared WS2 NWs were evaluated as anode materials of SIBs in two potential windows of 0.01-2.5 V and 0.5-3 V. WS2 NWs displayed a remarkable capacity (605.3 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) ) but with irreversible conversion reaction in the potential window of 0.01-2.5 V. In comparison, WS2 NWs showed a reversible intercalation mechanism in the potential window of 0.5-3 V, in which the nanowire-framework is well maintained. In the latter case, the interlayers of WS2 are gradually expanded and exfoliated during repeated charge-discharge cycling. This not only provides more active sites and open channels for the intercalation of Na(+) but also facilitates the electronic and ionic diffusion. Therefore, WS2 NWs exhibited an ultra-long cycle life with high capacity and rate capability in the potential window of 0.5-3 V. This study shows that WS2 NWs are promising as the anode materials of room-temperature SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Designed as a high-capacity, high-rate, and long-cycle life anode for sodium ion batteries, exfoliated-SnS2 restacked on graphene is prepared by the hydrolysis of lithiated SnS2 followed by a facile hydrothermal method. Structural and morphological characterizations demonstrate that ultrasmall SnS2 nanoplates (with a typical size of 20-50 nm) composed of 2-5 layers are homogeneously decorated on the surface of graphene, while the hybrid structure self-assembles into a three-dimensional (3D) network architecture. The obtained SnS2/graphene nanocomposite delivers a remarkable capacity as high as 650 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 200 mA g(-1). More impressively, the capacity can reach 326 mA h g(-1) even at 4000 mA g(-1) and remains stable at ∼610 mA h g(-1) without fading up to 300 cycles when the rate is brought back to 200 mA g(-1). The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the synergetic effects between the ultrasmall SnS2 and the highly conductive graphene network. The unique structure can simultaneously facilitate Na(+) ion diffusion, provide more reaction sites, and suppress aggregation and volume fluctuation of the active materials during prolonged cycling.",

        "abstract": "Heteroatom incorporation can effectively suppress the phase transition of layered sodium-ion battery cathode, but heteroatom behaviors during operating conditions are not completely understood at the atomic scale. Here, density functional theory calculations are combined with experiments to explore the mitigation behavior of Mg dopant and its mechanisms under operating conditions in P2-Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2. The void formed by Na extraction will pump some Mg dopants into Na layers from TM layers, and the collective diffusion of more than one Mg ion most likely occurs when the Mg content is relatively high in the TM layer, finally aggregating to form Mg-enrich regions (i.e., Mg segregation) apart from Ni vacancies. The void-pump-effect-induced Mg segregation effectively suppresses the P2-O2 phase transition owing to the stronger Mg-O electrostatic attraction that enhances the integrate of two adjacent oxygen layers and prevents the crack growth by mitigating the lattice volume variation under high-voltage cycling. Our work provides a fundamental understanding of heteroatom mitigation behavior in layered cathodes at the atomic level for next-generation energy storage technologies.",

        "abstract": "P2-type layered oxides based on the elements Fe and Mn have attracted great interest as sodium ion battery (SIB) cathode materials owing to their inexpensive metal constituents and high specific capacity. However, they suffer from rapid capacity fading and complicated phase transformations. In this study, we modulate the crystal structure and optimize the electrochemical performances of Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.5O2 by Al doping for Mn or Fe, respectively, and the roles of Al in the enhancement of the rate capability and cycling performance are unraveled. (1) The substitution of Al for Mn or Fe decreases the lattice parameters a and c but enlarges d spacing and lengthens Na-O bonds, which enhances Na+ diffusion and rate capability especially for Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.47Al0.03O2. (2) Al doping reduces the thickness of TMO2 and strengthens TM-O/O-O bonding. This enhances the layered structure stability and the capacity retention. (3) Al doping mitigates Mn3+ and Jahn-Teller distortion, mitigating the irreversible phase transition. (4) Al doping also alleviates the lattice volume variation and the structure strain. This further improves the stability of the layered structure and the cycling performances particularly in the case of Al doping for Fe. The in-depth insights into the roles of Al substitution might be also useful for designing high-performance cathode materials for SIBs through appropriate lattice doping.",

        "abstract": "Layered O3-type sodium oxides (NaMO2 , M=transition metal) commonly exhibit an O3-P3 phase transition, which occurs at a low redox voltage of about 3 V (vs. Na+ /Na) during sodium extraction and insertion, with the result that almost 50 % of their total capacity lies at this low voltage region, and they possess insufficient energy density as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (NIBs). Therefore, development of high-voltage O3-type cathodes remains challenging because it is difficult to raise the phase-transition voltage by reasonable structure modulation. A new example of O3-type sodium insertion materials is presented for use in NIBs. The designed O3-type Na0.7 Ni0.35 Sn0.65 O2 material displays a highest redox potential of 3.7 V (vs. Na+ /Na) among the reported O3-type materials based on the Ni2+ /Ni3+ couple, by virtue of its increased Ni-O bond ionicity through reduced orbital overlap between transition metals and oxygen within the MO2 slabs. This study provides an orbital-level understanding of the operating potentials of the nominal redox couples for O3-NaMO2 cathodes. The strategy described could be used to tailor electrodes for improved performance.",

In this work, we have developed manganese oxide (α-MnO2) nanorods for SIB applications. The crystal structure, which is crucial for high-performance energy storage, is examined systematically for the metal oxide cathode. The intercalation of sodium into the α-MnO2 matrix was studied using the theoretical density functional theory (DFT) studies. The DFT studies predict Na ions’ facile diffusion kinetics through the MnO2 lattice with an attractively low diffusion barrier (0.21 eV). When employed as a cathode material for SIBs, MnO2 showed a moderate capacity (109 mAh·g–1 at C/20 current rate) and superior life cyclability (58.6% after 800 cycles) in NaPF6/EC+DMC (5% FEC) electrolyte. It shows a much higher capacity of 181 mAh·g–1 (C/20 current rate) in NaClO4/PC (5% FEC) electrolyte, though it suffers fast capacity fading (11.5% after 800 cycles).

With respect to PB cathodes, however, their intrinsic crystal regularity, vacancies, and coordinated water will lead to low specific capacity and poor rate performance, impeding their application. Herein, nanocubic porous Nax FeFe(CN)6 coated with polydopamine (PDA) as a coupling layer to improve its electrochemical performance is reported, inspired by the excellent adhesive property of PDA. As a cathode for sodium-ion batteries, the Nax FeFe(CN)6 electrode coupled with PDA delivers a reversible capacity of 93.8 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 0.2 A g-1 , and a discharge capacity of 72.6 mA h g-1 at 5.0 A g-1 . The sodium storage mechanism of this Nax FeFe(CN)6 coupled with PDA is revealed via in situ Raman spectroscopy. The first-principles computational results indicate that FeII sites in PB prefer to couple with the robust PDA layer to stabilize the PB structure. Moreover, the sodium-ion migration in the PB structure is enhanced after coating with PDA, thus improving the sodium storage properties. Both experiments and computational simulations present guidelines for the rational design of nanomaterials as electrodes for energy storage devices.",

However, it still suffers from poor cycling stability mainly incurred by the undesirable P2-O2 phase transition. Herein, the electrochemically active Fe3+ ions are introduced into the lattice of NNMO, forming Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3- xFe xO2 ( x = 0, 1/24, 1/12, 1/8, 1/6) to effectively stabilize the P2-type crystalline structure. In such Fe-substituted materials, both Ni2+/Ni4+ and Fe3+/Fe4+ couples take part in the redox reactions, and the P2-O2 phase transition is well restrained during cycling, as verified by ex situ X-ray diffraction. As a result, the optimized Na2/3Ni1/3Mn7/12Fe1/12O2 (1/12-NNMF) has a long-term cycling stability with the fading rate of 0.05% per cycle over 300 cycles at 5 C. Furthermore, the 1/12-NNMF delivers excellent rate capabilities (65 mA h g-1 at 25 C) and superior low-temperature performance (the capacity retention of 94% at -25 °C after 80 cycles) owing to the enhanced Na diffusion upon Fe doping, which is deduced by the studies of electrode kinetics. More significantly, the 1/12-NNMF also displays remarkable sodium-ion full-cell properties when merged with an LS-Sb@G anode, thus implying the possibility of their practical application.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been regarded as a promising candidate for large-scale renewable energy storage system. Layered manganese oxide cathode possesses the advantages of high energy density, low cost and natural abundance while suffering from limited cycling life and poor rate capacity. To overcome these weaknesses, layer-tunnel hybrid material was developed and served as the cathode of SIB, which integrated high capacity, superior cycle ability, and rate performance. In the current work, the doping of copper was adopted to suppress the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn3+ and to affect relevant structural parameters. Multifunctions of the Cu2+ doping were carefully investigated. It was found that the structure component ratio is varied with the Cu2+ doping amount. Results demonstrated that Na+/vacancy rearrangement and phase transitions were suppressed during cycling without sacrificing the reversible capacity and enhanced electrochemical performances evidenced with 96 mA h g-1 retained after 250 cycles at 4 C and 85 mA h g-1 at 8 C. Furthermore, ex situ X-ray diffraction has demonstrated high reversibility of the Na0.6Mn0.9Cu0.1O2 cathode during Na+ extraction/insertion processes and superior air stability that results in better storage properties. This study reveals that the Cu2+ doping could be an effective strategy to tune the properties and related performances of Mn-based layer-tunnel hybrid cathode.",

DFT calculations suggest that the intermediate phase, Na1.5 FePO4 F, adopts the space group of P21 /c, which is a subgroup (P21 /b11, No. 14) of Pbcn (No. 60), the space group of the starting phase, Na2 FePO4 F, and this space group provides a good fit to the experimental XRD and NMR results. The two crystallographically unique Na sites in the structure of Na2 FePO4 F behave differently during cycling, where the Na ions on the Na2 site are electrochemically active while those on the Na1 site are inert.

In this paper, vanadium hexacyanoferrate cathodes was firstly used for constructing rechargeable aqueous sodium-ion batteries (VHCF/WO3), and tested in the new-type electrolyte (NaP-4.6) consisting of polyethylene glycol (PEG)/H2O/NaClO4 electrolyte with a low H+ concentration (molar ratio of [H2O]:[Na+] is 4.6), which performs high stability at a high current density as high as 1000 mA g-1 with a capacity retention of 90.3% after 2000 cycles at high coulombic efficiency (above 97.8%). To understand the outstanding performance, the proton-assisted sodium ion storage mechanism and interphase chemistry of VHCF is investigated by solid-state NMR technology. It is suggested that H+ storage reaction is accompanied by the redox of vanadium atoms, and Na+-intercalation is accompanied by the redox of iron atoms. It is also observed that the complex of polyethylene glycol (PEG) with Na+ (PEG-Na+) exists on the VHCF surface which facilitates the stability of VHCF and promotes the alkali ion transfer at a high current density.

To elucidate the origin of TM migration in layered SIB cathodes, we choose NaCrO2, a typical layered cathode suffering from serious TM migration, as a model material and find that the TM migration is derived from the random desodiation and subsequent formation of Na-free layer at high charge potential. A Ru/Ti co-doping strategy is developed to address the issue, where the doped active Ru is first oxidized to create a selective desodiation and the doped inactive Ti can function as a pillar to avoid complete desodiation in Ru-contained TM layers, leading to the suppression of the Na-free layer formation and subsequent enhanced electrochemical performance.",

Oxygen redox reactions in layered oxide cathodes are proven to contribute additionally high specific capacity, while such cathodes often suffer from irreversible structural transitions, causing serious capacity fading and voltage decay upon cycling, and the formation process of the oxidized oxygen species remains elusive. Herein, a series of Al‐doped P2‐type Na0.6Ni0.3Mn0.7O2 cathode materials for SIBs are reported and the corresponding charge compensation mechanisms are investigated qualitatively and quantitatively. The combined analyses reveal that Al doping boosts the reversible oxygen redox reactions through the reductive coupling reactions between orphaned O 2p states in NaOAl local configurations and Ni4+ ions, as directly evidenced by X‐ray absorption fine structure results. Additionally, Al doping also induces an increased interlayer spacing and inhibits the unfavorable P2 to O2 phase transition upon desodiation/sodiation, which is common in P2‐type Mn‐based cathode materials, leading to the great improvement in capacity retention and rate capability. This work provides deeper insights into the development of structurally stable and high‐capacity layered cathode materials for SIBs with anion–cation synergetic contributions.",

Nevertheless, conventional layered compounds involve detrimental phase transformation throughout repeated cycles, which results in electrochemical performance degradation. Therefore, finding structurally stable layered compounds, featuring minimal phase transition has been a key theme of the sodium-ion battery research. Here lithium substituted Fe/Mn-based P2/O3 layered oxide-Na0.67 Li0.2 Fe0.2 Mn0.6 O2 -that overcomes the inherited structural instability, is reported. In situ synchrotron-based diffraction measurements and DFT calculations are utilized, in order to identify the association between P2/O3 biphasic structure and electrochemical performances. The lithium honeycomb ordering within the P2/O3 biphasic layered compound effectively constrains the undesirable phase transitions; more specifically, both P2-Z phase transition and Jahn-Teller distortion are suppressed throughout wide potential range of 1.5-4.5 V. The DFT calculation further discovers that the presence of honeycomb ordering is crucial for achieving the structural stability by forming Na-vac-Li and Na-Li-Na pairing at highly charged state. The results highlight that the synergetic effect of P2/O3 biphasic structure and lithium substitution can provide an effective strategy toward achieving electrochemically stable layered cathode material for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) show practical applications in large‐scale energy storage systems. But, their power density is limited by the sluggish Na+ diffusion into the cathode and anode materials. Herein, the authors demonstrate a prototype of ultrahigh power SIB, consisting of the high‐rate Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode, graphite‐type mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB) anode, and Na+‐diglyme electrolyte. It is found that the overpotential of the NVP cathode obeys the Ohmic rule. Thus, the as‐synthesized NVP@C@carbon nanotubes (CNTs) cathode with the high conductive CNTs networks displays high electronic conductivity, reducing the overpotential and charge transfer resistances and leading to the remarkable rate capability over 1000C. For the MCMB anode, the initial [Na‐diglyme]+ co‐intercalation step is pseudocapacitive dominated, and then the expanded graphite's layers ensure the subsequent fast ions diffusion. The rapid (de)intercalation kinetics in between the cathode and anode are well‐matched. Thus, the assembled MCMB|1 m NaPF6 in diglyme|NVP@C@CNTs full‐cell SIB delivers the energy density of 88 Wh kg−1 at the high power density of ≈10 kW kg−1. Even at the ultrahigh power density of 23 kW kg−1, an energy density of 58 Wh kg−1 is obtained. The encouraging results of the full cell will promote the development of high‐power SIB for large‐scale applications in the future.",

        "abstract": "As for sodium-ion battery cathodes, the structure evolution during cycling plays a vital role in their electrochemical performance. Herein, through a strategy for engineering the crystal structure coupled with chemical element substitution, we design a layered P2@P3 integrated spinel Na 0.5 Ni 0.1 Co 0.15 Mn 0.65 Mg 0.1 O 2 oxide cathode. This novel electrode shows excellent sodium-ion half/full battery performance due to the synergistic effects of its triphase intergrowth structure and cation substitution strategy. Based on combined analyses by scanning transmission electron microscopy with atomic resolution, as well as ex-situ synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectra and in-situ synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction patterns, the inherent layered P2@P3 integrated spinel structure, charge compensation mechanism, structural evolution, and phase transition are clearly articulated and confirmed. This study provides an in-depth understanding of the structure-performance relationship in this special structure and opens up a novel field via manipulating structural evolution for the design of high-performance battery cathodes.",

The reaction results in just a minor lattice contraction, and a broad intervalence charge-transfer band emerges, indicative of charge mobility. Although both metal- and ligand-based oxidations can be accessed, only the former were found to be fully reversible and, importantly, proceed stoichiometrically under both chemical and electrochemical conditions. Electrochemical measurements probing the effects of nanoconfinement on the insertion reaction revealed strong anion size and solvent dependences. Significantly, the anion insertion behavior of Fe2(dobpdc) enabled its use in the construction of a dual-ion battery prototype incorporating a sodium anode. As a cathode, the material displays a particularly high initial reduction potential and is further stable for at least 50 charge/discharge cycles, exhibiting a maximum specific energy of 316 Wh/kg.",

Creating air-stable and high-voltage layered cathodes for sodium-ion full batteries still remains a challenge. Herein, we describe a rational designing and preparation of a stable P3-Na2/3Ni1/4Mg1/12Mn2/3O2 cathode. The cathode displays a satisfactory working voltage of 3.6 V and excellent cyclic stability over 100 cycles at 1 C rate without obvious capacity fading. The results of ex-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) demonstrate that P3-type structure is well retained even charged to 4.4 V. Furthermore, the structural characterization by XRD Rietveld refinement, scanning electron microscope and electrochemical testing certify that the cathode maintains its structure commendably even when soaked in water for 12 h. In particular, the P3- Na2/3Ni1/4Mg1/12Mn2/3O2//hard carbon assembled for full battery exhibits a desired competitive high voltage of 3.45 V and an attractive energy density up to 412.2 Wh kg-1 based on the cathode.

        "abstract": "All-solid-state sodium ion batteries (ASIBs) based on sulfide electrolytes are considered a promising candidate for large-scale energy storage. However, the limited cycle life of ASIBs largely restricts their practical application. Cycling-stable ASIBs can be achieved only if the designed cathode can simultaneously address challenges including insufficient interfacial contact, electrochemical and chemical instability between the electrode and electrolyte, and strain/stress during operation , rather than just addressing one or part of these challenges. Chevrel phase Mo6S8 has inherent high electronic conductivity and small volume change during sodiation/desodiation, and is chemically and electrochemically stable with the sulfide electrolyte, and therefore the only challenge of using Mo6S8 as the cathode for ASIBs is the insufficient contact between Mo6S8 and the solid electrolyte (SE). Herein, a thin layer of SE is coated on Mo6S8 using a solution method to achieve an intimate contact between Mo6S8 and the SE. Such a SE-coated Mo6S8 cathode enabled an ASIB with a high cycling performance (500 cycles), even much better than that of the liquid-electrolyte batteries with the Mo6S8 cathode. This work provides valuable insights for developing long-cycle life ASIBs.",

The capacity of the cathode combined with that provided by the electrolyte redox reaction thus increases overall charge storage. An aqueous sodium hexacyanoferrate (Na4 Fe(CN)6 ) solution is employed as the redox-active electrolyte (Na-FC) and sodium nickel Prussian blue (Nax -NiBP) as the Na+ ion insertion/de-insertion cathode. The capacity of DESIB with Na-FC electrolyte is twice that of a battery using a conventional (Na2 SO4 ) electrolyte.

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion battery has been considered as one of the most promising power sources for large‐scale energy storage systems due to its similar electrochemistry to the lithium‐ion battery and the crust abundance of Na resources. Essentially, developing low‐cost electrode materials along with a facile and economical synthesis procedure is critically important to promote the commercialization of sodium‐ion batteries. However, applicable cathode materials capable of being massively produced are still scarcely reported to date.

Lithium could be selectively leached into solution using formic acid while aluminum remained as the metallic form, and most of the other metals from the cathode scrap could be precipitated out. This phenomenon clearly demonstrates that formic acid can be used for lithium recovery from cathode scrap, as both leaching and separation reagent. By investigating the effects of different parameters including temperature, formic acid concentration, H2O2 amount, and solid to liquid ratio, the leaching rate of Li can reach 99.93% with minor Al loss into the solution. Subsequently, the leaching kinetics was evaluated and the controlling step as well as the apparent activation energy could be determined. After further separation of the remaining Ni, Co, and Mn from the leachate, Li2CO3 with the purity of 99.90% could be obtained. The final solution after lithium carbonate extraction can be further processed for sodium formate preparation, and Ni, Co, and Mn precipitates are ready for precursor preparation for cathode materials. As a result, the global recovery rates of Al, Li, Ni, Co, and Mn in this process were found to be 95.46%, 98.22%, 99.96%, 99.96%, and 99.95% respectively, achieving effective resources recycling from cathode scrap of spent LIB.",

        "abstract": "An advanced cathode material, nitrogen-doped carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3 hybriding with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) composite, namely double-nanocarbon synergistically modified Na3V2(PO4)3 of sodium ion battery, was fabricated through a simple sol-gel approach. According to the systemical analysis of experimental results on this composite structure, it is found that N-doping not only increases Na-ion migration velocity across the carbon-coated layer but also improves the electric conductivity of the carbon layer. More importantly, the CNTs 3D conducting network could significantly accelerate the electron transport between multiple particles of Na3V2(PO4)3, due to the intimate contacts between active materials and CNTs. Consenquently, the electrochemical properties of this double-nanocarbon-modified Na3V2(PO4)3 are significantly enhanced, especially the high-rate capability and long cycle life. For instance, its initial capacity of 94.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C decreases to 70 mAh g(-1) at 70 C, and the capacity retention is 74%. Moreover, when dischage rate increases to a higher 30 C, the capacity retention is still as high as 87% after 300 cycles.",

        "abstract": "The development of excellent performance of Na‐ion batteries remains great challenge owing to the poor stability and sluggish kinetics of cathode materials. Herein, B substituted Na3V2P3–xBxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) as stable cathode materials for Na‐ion battery is presented. A combined experimental and theoretical investigations on Na3V2P3–xBxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) are undertaken to reveal the evolution of crystal and electronic structures and Na storage properties associated with various concentration of B. X‐ray diffraction results indicate that the crystal structure of Na3V2P3–xBxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1/3) consisted of rhombohedral Na3V2(PO4)3 with tiny shrinkage of crystal lattice. X‐ray absorption spectra and the calculated crystal structures all suggest that the detailed local structural distortion of substituted materials originates from the slight reduction of V–O distances. Na3V2P3‐1/6B1/6O12 significantly enhances the structural stability and electrochemical performance, giving remarkable enhanced capacity of 100 and 70 mAh g−1 when the C‐rate increases to 5 C and 10 C. Spin‐polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that, as compared with the pristine Na3V2(PO4)3, the superior electrochemical performance of the substituted materials can be attributed to the emergence of new boundary states near the band gap, lower Na+ diffusion energy barriers, and higher structure stability.",

To address this issue, we designed and successfully synthesized a core/double-shell structured Na3V2(PO4)2F3@C nanocomposite (Na3V2(PO4)2F3@CD) by in situ carbon coating and embedding the Na3V2(PO4)2F3 nanoparticles in ordered mesoporous carbon framework. Benefiting from the sufficient electrochemically available interfaces and abundant electronic/ionic pathways, this Na3V2(PO4)2F3@CD material demonstrated superior Na+-storage performance with a high reversible capacity of 120 mA h g-1 at a moderate current of 1 C, a strong high-rate capability with 63 mA h g-1 at an extremely high rate of 100 C, and a long-cycle lifespan with 65% capacity retention over 5000 cycles. These superior electrochemical performances remained stable when the Na3V2(PO4)2F3@CD cathode was used in a full cell, suggesting a promising application of the material for high rate and long lifespan sodium-ion batteries.

We demonstrate how a stretched exponential function permits us to systematically quantify the rate performance, which in turn reveals guidelines for the design of novel sodium-ion battery chemistries suitable for high power, grid-scale applications. Starting from a diffusion relaxation model, we establish a semi-quantitative prediction of the rate-performance of half-cells from the structure of the cathode material that factors in dimensionality of Na+ ion migration pathways, the height of the migration barriers and the crystallite size of the active material. With the help of selected examples, we also illustrate the respective roles of unoccupied low energy sites within the pathway and temperature towards the overall rate capability of insertion-type cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "The development of secondary batteries based on abundant and cheap elements is vital. Among various alternatives to conventional lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are promising due to the abundant resources and low cost of sodium. While there are many challenges associated with the SIB system, cathode is an important factor in determining the electrochemical performance of this battery system. Accordingly, ongoing research in the field of SIBs is inclined towards the development of safe, cost effective cathode materials having improved performance. In particular, pyrophosphate cathodes have recently demonstrated decent electrochemical performance and thermal stability. Herein, we report the synthesis, electrochemical properties, and thermal behavior of a novel Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 cathode for SIBs. The material was synthesized through a solid state process. The structural analysis reveals that the mixed substitution of manganese and iron has resulted in a triclinic crystal structure (P1[combining macron] space group). Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements indicate that Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 is electrochemically active with a reversible capacity of ∼80 mA h g(-1) at a C/20 rate with an average redox potential of 3.2 V. (vs. Na/Na(+)). It is noticed that 84% of initial capacity is preserved over 90 cycles showing promising cyclability. It is also noticed that the rate capability of Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 is better than Na2MnP2O7. Ex situ and CV analyses indicate that Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 undergoes a single phase reaction rather than a biphasic reaction due to different Na coordination environment and different Na site occupancy when compared to other pyrophosphate materials (Na2FeP2O7 and Na2MnP2O7). Thermogravimetric analysis (25-550 °C) confirms good thermal stability of Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7 with only 2% weight loss. Owing to promising electrochemical properties and decent thermal stability, Na2Fe0.5Mn0.5P2O7, can be an attractive cathode for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sacrificial cathode additive as a pre-metallation method could ensure adequate metal sources for advanced energy storage devices. However, this pre-metallation technique is seriously suffered from the precise regulation of decomposition potential of additive. Herein, a molecularly compensated pre-metallation (Li/Na/K) strategy has been successfully achieved through Kolbe electrolysis, in which the electrochemical oxidation potential of metal carboxylate is manipulated by the bonding energy of oxygen-metal (O-M) moiety. As theoretically predicted, the electron-donating effect of substituent and low charge density of cation can dramatically weaken the O-M bond strength, further bringing out the reduced potential. Thus, sodium acetate exhibits a superior pre-sodiation feature for sodium-ion battery accompanied with a large irreversible specific capacity of 301.8 mAh g -1 , remarkably delivering 70. 6% enhanced capacity retention after 100 cycles. Notably, this elaborate methodology has been profoundly extended to construct high-performance lithium-ion battery and lithium/sodium/potassium-ion capacitor. This breakthrough has paved an innovative pathway for pre-metallation enabled by organic electrochemistry, offering in-depth insights into directional design of sacrificial reagent for electrochemical energy storage systems.",

        "abstract": "Manganese-based Prussian Blue, Na2-δMn[Fe(CN)6] (MnPB), is an auspicious candidate for sodium-ion battery cathode materials due to its high capacity. However, it suffers from severe capacity decay during battery cycling due to the destabilizing Jahn-Teller distortions it undergoes as Mn2+ is oxidized to Mn3+. In this work, the structure is stabilized by a thin epitaxial surface layer of nickel-based Prussian Blue (Na2-δNi[Fe(CN)6]). The one-pot synthesis relies on a chelating agent with an unequal affinity for Mn2+ and Ni2+ ions, which prevents Ni2+ from reacting until the Mn2+ is consumed. This is a new and simpler synthesis of core-shell materials, which traditionally require several steps. The resulting material has an electrochemical capacity of 93 mA h g-1, of which it retains 96% after 500 charge-discharge cycles (vs 37% for MnPB). The material's rate capability is also remarkable: at 4 A g-1 (ca. 55 C) it can reversibly store 70 mA h g-1, which is also reflected in its diffusion coefficient of ~10-8 cm2 s-1. The epitaxial nature of the outer layer appears to exert an anisotropic strain on the inner layer, which may prevent the Jahn-Teller distortions it normally undergoes during de-sodiation.",

Nevertheless, the influence of Li at different locations in the structure has not been investigated.

Partial substitution of Na with Li leads to enhanced stability and slightly increased specific capacity compared to PNNMO.

        "abstract": "Sodium superionic conductor (NASICON)-Na4 VMn(PO4 )3 (NVMP) cathode is attractive for sodium-ion battery application due to its reduced cost and toxicity, and high energy density (≈425 Wh kg-1 ). However, it exhibits significant polarization, limited rate and cycling performances due to its lower electronic conductivity and formation of Jahn-Teller active Mn3+ during cycling. In this report, a chemical approach is presented to partially replace Mn2+ of the NVMP framework by Mg2+ and Al3+ substitutions. The Mg- and Al-substituted NVMP cathodes present smoother voltage profiles, facile sodium (de)intercalation, enhanced rate performances (80 mA h g-1 at 5C rate) and capacity retention (≈96% after 100 cycles) in comparison with the unsubstituted sample. Their enhanced performances are attributed to suppressed Jahn-Teller effect, increased covalent character and sodium ion vacancies of the NASICON framework. These results highlight the significance of fine tuning the chemical compositions to attain high performance NASICON cathodes.",

        "abstract": "Although sodium vanadium fluorophosphate, Na3(VO1-xPO4)2F1+2x (0 ≤ x ≤ 1), is a highly promising cathode candidate for sodium-ion batteries due to its stable structure and high working voltage, the low charge diffusion dynamics and the inactive materials used in traditional coating electrodes reduce the energy density of a sodium-ion full battery. Hence, Na3V2O2(PO4)2F/graphene aerogels (NVPF/GAs) with a three-dimensional continuous porous network are firstly prepared by co-assembly and freeze-drying. The three-dimensional porous network helps obtain a high NVPF content of 81 wt.%, relieve the volume change for improving the cyclability, and enhance the wettability of the electrode with the electrolyte for accelerating the diffusion dynamics of sodium ions and electrons. As a directly used freestanding cathode without the use of any binder/collector, an optimized freestanding NVPF/GA electrode exhibits excellent cycling and rate performances than those of traditional coating electrodes. The average capacities at current densities of 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 C are 135.4, 128.0, 125.1, 121.9 and 115.1 mA h g-1, respectively. Especially, it maintains a capacity retention of 100% after 1000 cycles at an ultrahigh current of 40 C. A sodium-ion full battery with the NVPF/GA cathode and the Sb/graphene/carbon anode attains a of 82.1 mA h g-1 without an obvious decline after 100 cycles.",

X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared measurements were used to characterize the materials and their surface species before and after controlled-atmosphere storage. It was determined that the exposure of untreated NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 powders to moisture results in desodiation and material degradation, leading to poor cycling. This effect was found to be caused by reactive surface species. From these results, a simple ethanol washing method was found to significantly reduce the air-reactivity and improve the electrochemical performance of NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 by removing surface impurities formed by air exposure.",

The NNMO@CuO cathode material combines the advantages of CuO coating and Cu2+ doping. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, TEM elemental line scan analysis and ex situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that CuO has been successfully coated on the particle surface uniformly, and that this CuO layer effectively suppresses the exfoliation of the metal oxide layers and unfavorable side reactions. Furthermore, Cu2+ is also partially incorporated into the host structure, according to the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and refinement results. Although incorporated Cu2+ does not take part in the redox reactions of the battery cell, the refinement results indicate that the d-spacing of the Na+-ion diffusion layer is enlarged due to Cu2+ doping in the crystal structure, which results in better Na+ kinetics. Thus, the CuO-coated cathode material shows prominent cycling performance and rate capability. We believe that this CuO-coating and Cu2+-doping co-modification strategy provides a promising approach to designing advanced cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

In this work, a monolithic sodium ion battery based on a Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 cathode, MoS2 layered anode, and polyether-based polymer electrolyte is reported. In addition, a new kind of polysulfonamide-supported poly(ethylene glycol) divinyl ether based polymer electrolyte is also demonstrated for monolithic sodium ion battery via in situ preparation. The resultant polymer electrolyte exhibits relatively high ionic conductivity (1.2 mS cm-1 ) at ambient temperature, wide electrochemical window (4.7 V), and favorable mechanical strength (25 MPa). Moreover, such a monolithic Na3 V2 (PO4 )3 /MoS2 sodium ion battery using this polymer electrolyte delivers outstanding rate capability (up to 10 C) and superior cyclic stability (84%) after 1000 cycles at 0.5 C. What is more essential, such a polymer electrolyte based soft-package monolithic sodium ion cell can still power a red light emitting diode lamp and run finite times without suffering from any internal short-circuit failures, even in the case of a bended and wrinkled state. Considering these aspects, this work no doubt provides a new approach for the design of a high-performance polymer electrolyte toward monolithic sodium ion battery with exceptional rate capability and high safety.",

        "abstract": "Large-scale electric energy storage is fundamental to the use of renewable energy. Recently, research and development efforts on room-temperature sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) have been revitalized, as NIBs are considered promising, low-cost alternatives to the current Li-ion battery technology for large-scale applications. Herein, we introduce a novel layered oxide cathode material, Na0.78Ni0.23Mn0.69O2. This new compound provides a high reversible capacity of 138 mAh g-1 and an average potential of 3.25 V vs Na+/Na with a single smooth voltage profile. Its remarkable rate and cycling performances are attributed to the elimination of the P2-O2 phase transition upon cycling to 4.5 V. The first charge process yields an abnormally excess capacity, which has yet to be observed in other P2 layered oxides. Metal K-edge XANES results show that the major charge compensation at the metal site during Na-ion deintercalation is achieved via the oxidation of nickel (Ni2+) ions, whereas, to a large extent, manganese (Mn) ions remain in their Mn4+ state. Interestingly, electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS) results reveal differences in electronic structures in the bulk and at the surface of electrochemically cycled particles. At the surface, transition metal ions (TM ions) are in a lower valence state than in the bulk, and the O K-edge prepeak disappears. On the basis of previous reports on related Li-excess LIB cathodes, it is proposed that part of the charge compensation mechanism during the first cycle takes place at the lattice oxygen site, resulting in a surface to bulk transition metal gradient. We believe that by optimizing and controlling oxygen activity, Na layered oxide materials with higher capacities can be designed.",

Here, a quantitative analysis of Zn2+ and H+ transport in a disordered sodium vanadate (NaV3O8) cathode material has been reported. Collectively, synchrotron X-ray analysis shows that both Zn2+ and H+ storages follow an intercalation storage mechanism in NaV3O8 and proceed in a sequential manner, where intercalations of 0.26 Zn2+ followed by 0.24 H+ per vanadium atom occur during discharging, while reverse dynamics happens during charging. Such a unique and synergistic dual-ion sequential storage favors a high capacity (265 mA h g-1) and an energy density (221 W h kg-1) based on the NaV3O8 cathode and a great cycling life (a capacity retention of 78% after 2000 cycles) in Zn/NaV3O8 full cells.",

        "abstract": "Electrochemical energy storage has recently seen tremendous emphasis being placed on the large-scale (power) grid storage. Sodium-ion batteries are capable of achieving this goal with economic viability. In a recent breakthrough in sodium-ion battery research, the alluaudite framework (Na2Fe2(SO4)3) has been reported, with the highest Fe3+/Fe2+ redox potential (ca. 3.8 V, Barpanda, et al., Nat. Commun., 2014, 5, 4358). Exploring this high-voltage sodium insertion system, we report the discovery of Na2+2xCo2-x(SO4)3 (x = 0.16) as a new member of the alluaudite class of cathode. Stabilized by low-temperature solid-state synthesis (T ≤ 350 °C), this novel Co-based compound assumes a monoclinic structure with C2/c symmetry, which undergoes antiferromagnetic ordering below 10.2 K. Isotypical to the Fe-homologue, it forms a complete family of solid-solution Na2+2x(Fe1-yCoy)2-x(SO4)3 [y = 0-1]. Ab initio DFT analysis hints at potential high voltage operation at 4.76-5.76 V (vs. Na), depending on the degree of desodiation involving a strong participation of the oxygen sub-lattice. With the development of safe organic electrolytes, Na2+2xCo2-x(SO4)3 can work as a cathode material (∼5 V) for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Due to its potential cost advantage, sodium ion batteries could become a commercial alternative to lithium ion batteries. One promising cathode material for this type of battery is layered sodium manganese oxide. In this investigation we report on the influence of morphology on cycle performance for the layered NaxMnO2+z. Hollow spheres of NaxMnO2+z with a diameter of ∼5 μm were compared to flake-like NaxMnO2+z. It was found that the electrochemical behavior of both materials as measured by cyclic voltammetry is comparable. However, the cycle stability of the spheres is significantly higher, with 94 mA h g(-1) discharge capacity after 100 cycles, as opposed to 73 mA h g(-1) for the flakes (50 mA g(-1)). The better stability can potentially be attributed to better accommodation of volume changes of the material due to its spherical morphology, better contact with the added conductive carbon, and higher electrode/electrolyte interface owing to better wetting of the active material with the electrolyte.",

Here we propose a cyanoperovskite KxMnFe(CN)6 (0 ≤ x ≤ 2) as a potassium cathode: high-spin MnIII/MnII and low-spin FeIII/FeII couples have similar energies and exhibit two close plateaus centered at 3.6 V; two active K+ per formula unit enable a theoretical specific capacity of 156 mAh g-1; Mn and Fe are the two most-desired transition metals for electrodes because they are cheap and environmental friendly.

A water-insoluble polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) binder has been widely applied for an aqueous battery, in which the toxic and expensive organic solvent of N-methy-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) is required during the coating process. Herein, we report that the water-soluble SA can be utilized as a binder in aqueous Zn batteries because SA could cross-link with the Zn2+ ion to form a water-insoluble and mechanically super strong binder for electrodes. Aqueous Zn||LiFePO4 cells are assembled to demonstrate the performance of the SA binder for LiFePO4 cathodes. Due to the high adhesion strength of cross-linked Zn-SA, LiFePO4 with the SA binder displays a high capacity retention of 93.7% with a high Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% after 100 cycles at a 0.2 C rate, while the capacity of LiFePO4 with the PVDF binder quickly decays to 84.7% after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. In addition, the LiFePO4 cathode with the SA binder also has smaller redox polarization, faster ion diffusion rate, and more favorable electrochemical kinetics than that with the PVDF binder.",

On the basis of time-dependent experiments, a defect-induced morphological evolution mechanism from nanocube to nanoflower structure is proposed. Through in situ X-ray diffraction measurement and computational analysis, this unique structure is revealed to provide higher Na+ diffusion dynamics and negligible volume change during the sodiation/desodiation processes. As a sodium ion battery cathode, the PBA exhibits a discharge capacity of 90 mA h g-1, which is in good agreement with the complete low spin FeLS(C) redox reaction.

Combining advantages of both, a hybrid‐cation liquid metal battery is designed for a Li‐ion‐insertion‐based cathode to deliver stable high capacity using a Na–K liquid anode to avoid dendrites. The mechanical property of the Na–K alloy is confirmed by simulation and experimental characterization, which leads to stable cycling performance. The charge carrier selection principle in this ternary hybrid‐cation system is investigated, showing consistency with the proposed interfacial layer formation and ion distribution mechanism for the electrochemical process as well as the good stability. With Li ions contributing stable cycling as the cathode charge carrier, the K ion working as charge carrier on the anode, and Na as the medium to liquefy K metal, such a ternary hybrid battery system not only inherits the rich battery chemistry of Li‐insertion cathodes but also broadens the understanding of alkali metal alloys and hybrid‐ion battery chemistry.",

These two new batteries together with the previously developed Li(+) /Na(+) mixed-ion battery not only constitute a new battery family for energy storage, but also greatly broaden our horizons for battery research.",

In this work, we develop a dual-network structured hydrogel electrolyte composed of polyacrylamide (PAM), sodium alginate (SA) and potassium iodide (KI) for solid-state zinc-air/iodide hybrid batteries. The assembled hybrid battery shows excellent renewability and a long cycling life of 110 h with a high energy efficiency of 80%. The ion-crosslinked dual-network structure endows the material with improved mechanical strength and increased ionic conductivity. More importantly, the introduction of iodine species not only offers more favorable cathodic kinetics of iodide/iodate redox than oxygen electrocatalysis but also regulates the solvation structure of zinc ions to ensure better interface stability.

All the components are robust in a traditional lithium-ion battery (LIB) organic electrolyte and disappear in water completely within minutes due to triggered cascade reactions. With a simple cut-and-stack method, we designed a fully transient device with an area of 0.5 cm by 1 cm and total energy of 0.1 J. A shadow-mask technique was used to demonstrate the miniature device, which is compatible with transient electronics manufacturing. The materials, fabrication methods, and integration strategy discussed will be of interest for future developments in transient, self-powered electronics. The demonstration of a miniature Li battery shows the feasibility toward system integration for all transient electronics.",

The calculated equilibrium morphology is mostly isometric in appearance, with (010), (201) and (011) faces dominant. Exposure of the (010) surface is vital because it is normal to the one-dimensional ion-conduction pathway.

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries have recently emerged as a promising alternative to lithium‐based batteries, driven by an ever‐growing demand for electricity storage systems. The present workproposes a cobalt‐free high‐capacity cathode for sodium‐ion batteries, synthesized using a high‐entropy approach. The high‐entropy approach entails mixing more than five elements in a single phase; hence, obtaining the desired properties is a challenge since this involves the interplay between different elements. Here, instead of oxide, oxyfluoride is chosen to suppress oxygen loss during long‐term cycling. Supplement to this, lithium is introduced in the composition to obtain high configurational entropy and sodium vacant sites, thus stabilizing the crystal structure, accelerating the kinetics of intercalation/deintercalation, and improving the air stability of the material. With the optimization of the cathode composition, a reversible capacity of 109 mAh g−1 (2–4 V) and 144 mAh g−1 (2–4.3 V) is observed in the first few cycles, along with a significant improvement in stability during prolonged cycling. Furthermore, in situ and ex situ diffraction studies during charging/discharging reveal that the high‐entropy strategy successfully suppresses the complex phase transition. The impressive outcomes of the present work strongly motivate the pursuit of the high‐entropy approach to develop efficient cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries.",

Herein, Na5V12O32 nanobelts (NVO‐NBs)‐based heterostructure is fabricated with boosting the sodium‐ion kinetic characteristics to address the challenges. In the heterostructure, the controllable VOC bonds are generated at the interface originating from the chemical conversion of functional groups of the reduced graphene oxides (rGOs) with VO bonding of NVO through interfacial electronic interactions. The interfacial synergistic between the brilliant bonding properties and the inherent formation of a stress field at the heterointerface motivated by work function difference can reduce the Na+ diffusion barrier, facilitate charge transfer, hence accelerates reaction kinetics and electron/ion transport, as well as modifying the electronic structure to realize a cherished adsorption energy of Na+. Therefore, the optimized NVO‐NBs‐based heterostructure exhibits exceptional rate capability (213 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C with 100 mAh g−1 at 10 C) and ultralong cycling stability (95.4%, 3000 cycles at 5 C).

Herein, a high‐entropy substitution strategy, to alter the detailed crystal structure of NVPF without changing the central active V atom, is pioneeringly utilized, achieving simultaneous electronic conductivity enhancement and diffusion barrier reduction for Na+, according to theoretical calculations. The as‐prepared carbon‐free high‐entropy Na3V1.9(Ca,Mg,Al,Cr,Mn)0.1(PO4)2F3 (HE‐NVPF) cathode can deliver higher mean voltage of 3.81 V and more advantageous energy density up to 445.5 Wh kg−1, which is attributed by the diverse transition‐metal elemental substitution in high‐entropy crystalline. More importantly, high‐entropy introduction can help realize disordered rearrangement of Na+ at Na(2) active sites, thereby to refrain from unfavorable discharging behaviors at low‐voltage region, further lifting up the mean working voltage to realize a full Na‐ion storage at the high voltage plateau. Coupling with a hard carbon (HC) anode, HE‐NVPF//HC SIB full cells can deliver high specific energy density of 326.8 Wh kg−1 at 5 C with the power density of 2178.9 W kg−1.

However, their rate capability and durability are limited by tortuous Na+ diffusion channels and complicated phase evolution during Na+ extraction/insertion. Here we report our findings in unravelling the mechanism for dramatically enhancing the stability and rate capability of O3-NaNi0.5Mn0.5-xSbxO2 (NaNMS) by substitutional Sb doping, which can alter the coordination environment and chemical bonds of the transition metal (TM) ions in the structure, resulting in a more stable structure with wider Na+ transport channels. Furthermore, NaNMS nanoparticles are obtained by surface energy regulation during grain growth. The synergistic effect of Sb doping and nanostructuring greatly reduces the ionic migration energy barrier while increasing the reversibility of the structural evolution during repeated Na+ extraction/insertion. An optimized NaNMS-1 electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 212.3 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C and 74.5 mAh g-1 at 50 C with minimal capacity loss after 100 cycles at a low temperature of -20 °C.

In this way, the interlayer OO electrostatic repulsion is weakened upon deeply charging, which strongly affects the systematic total energy that transforms the striking P2–O2 interlayer contraction into a moderate solid‐solution‐type evolution. Accordingly, the cycling stability of the codoped cathode material is improved superiorly over the pristine sample.

To date, no Na-ion counterpart exists wherein Na-ion cathodes can be synthesized in such a way to be comparable to that obtained in bulk synthesis. Herein, we develop a synthesis route wherein hundreds of mg-scale powder samples can be made in a total time of 3 days. We focus on materials in the Na-Fe-Mn-O pseudo-ternary system of high immediate interest. Using a sol-gel method, developed herein, yields both phase-pure combinatorial samples of Na2/3Fe1/2Mn1/2O2 and NaFe1/2Mn1/2O2, consistent with previous reports on bulk samples of interest commercially. By contrast, the synthesis route used for Li-ion cathodes (namely co-precipitations) does not yield phase pure materials, suggesting that the sol-gel method is more effective in mixing the Na, Fe and Mn than co-precipitation. This has important consequences for all attempts to make these materials, even in bulk. Finally, we demonstrate that these mg-scale powder samples can be tested electrochemically in a combinatorial cell. The resulting cyclic voltammograms are in excellent agreement with those found on bulk samples in the literature. This demonstrates that the methodology developed here will be effective in characterizing the hundreds of samples needed to understand the complex ternary systems of interest, and that such results will scale-up well to the g and kg-scale.",

Layered iron/manganese oxide cathodes receive extensive attentions due to the element abundance and large theoretical capacity. However, these materials usually undergo obvious degradation of electrochemical performance due to the tendency of Mn dissolution and Fe migration during continuous sodium release and uptake. Herein, a strategy of anion–cation synergetic redox is proposed to suppress the structural deterioration originated from overusing the electrochemical activity of transition‐metal ions, and decreased lattice strain as well as superior electrochemical performance are realized simultaneously. Results show that the Na0.8Li0.2Fe0.2Mn0.6O2 (NLFM) electrode is highly resistant to the erosion of moisture that is distinct from the traditional Mn/Fe‐based electrodes. Moreover, the NLFM electrode demonstrates solid solution behavior without phase transition during cycles. The ultra‐small volume change of 0.85% is ascribed to the negligible manganese dissolution and invisible transition‐metal migration. The high‐stable layered structure assures superior reversible capacity of ≈165 mA h g–1, excellent rate capability, and splendid capacity retention of over 98.3% with 100 cycles. The findings deepen the understanding of the synergy between anion and cation redox and provide new insights to design the high‐stable layered cathode for sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Layered oxides as the cathode materials of sodium-ion batteries are receiving extensive attention due to their high capacity and flexible composition. However, the layered cathode tends to be thermodynamically and electrochemically unstable during sodiation and de-sodiation. Herein, we for the first time propose the \"pinning effect\" and controllable \"pinning point\" in sodium storage layered cathodes to enhance the structural stability and achieve the optimal electrochemical performance. 0%, 2.5% and 7.3% transition-metal (TM) occupancies in Na-site as pinning points are obtained through adjusting the feeding ratio of iron in Na 0.67 Mn 0.5 Co 0.5- x Fe x O 2 system. Results show that 2.5% TM pinning is beneficial to restrain the potential slab sliding and enhance the structural stability, resulting in an ultra-low volume variation of 0.6% and maintaining the smooth two-dimensional channel for Na-ion transfer. Finally, the Na 0.67 Mn 0.5 Co 0.4 Fe 0.1 O 2 cathode with the optimal TM pinning delivers outstanding cycling performance of over 1000 cycles and superior rate capability up to 10C.",

        "abstract": "Oxygen‐redox of layer‐structured metal‐oxide cathodes has drawn great attention as an effective approach to break through the bottleneck of their capacity limit. However, reversible oxygen‐redox can only be obtained in the high‐voltage region (usually over 3.5 V) in current metal‐oxide cathodes. Here, we realize reversible oxygen‐redox in a wide voltage range of 1.5–4.5 V in a P2‐layered Na0.7Mg0.2[Fe0.2Mn0.6□0.2]O2 cathode material, where intrinsic vacancies are located in transition‐metal (TM) sites and Mg‐ions are located in Na sites. Mg‐ions in the Na layer serve as “pillars” to stabilize the layered structure during electrochemical cycling, especially in the high‐voltage region. Intrinsic vacancies in the TM layer create the local configurations of “□–O–□”, “Na–O–□” and “Mg–O–□” to trigger oxygen‐redox in the whole voltage range of charge–discharge. Time‐resolved techniques demonstrate that the P2 phase is well maintained in a wide potential window range of 1.5–4.5 V even at 10 C. It is revealed that charge compensation from Mn‐ and O‐ions contributes to the whole voltage range of 1.5–4.5 V, while the redox of Fe‐ions only contributes to the high‐voltage region of 3.0–4.5 V. The orphaned electrons in the nonbonding 2p orbitals of O that point toward TM‐vacancy sites are responsible for reversible oxygen‐redox, and Mg‐ions in Na sites suppress oxygen release effectively.",

        "abstract": "The nucleation rate plays a critical role in the synthesis of Prussian blue analogs. Rapid precipitation may lead to a large number of vacancies and a large amount of interstitial water in the material, resulting in poor electrochemical performance in batteries. Hence, sodium citrate is used to compete with [Fe(CN)6]4- to slow down the coordination rates of Ni2+ and Mn2+ ions with ferrous cyanide ions. The feasibility of the experiment is also confirmed by theoretical analysis. Benefiting from stable crystal structure and the removal of interstitial water, the as-prepared Na2NixMnyFe(CN)6 sample exhibits a high reversible capacity of 150 mA h g-1. In addition, a high rate performance of 77 mA h g-1 is achieved at a current density of 1600 mA g-1. Most noteworthy, the Coulombic efficiency and specific capacity gradually increase in the first few cycles, which can be ascribed to the formation of a passivation layer on the surface of the electrode. Continuous testing in an electrolyte solution of 1 M NaPF6 dissolved in sulfone reveals that the presence of a passivation film is very important for the stability of the electrode.",

Herein, a dual‐strategy is developed to boost the Na‐storage performance of the Fe/Mn‐based layered oxide cathode by copper (Cu) doping and nanoengineering. The P2‐Na0.76Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48O2 cathode material synthesized by electrospinning exhibits the pearl necklace‐like hierarchical nanostructures assembled by nanograins with sizes of 50–150 nm. The synergistic effects of Cu doping and nanotechnology enable high Na+ coefficients and low ionic migration energy barrier, as well as highly reversible structure evolution and Cu/Fe/Mn valence variation upon repeated sodium insertion/extraction; thus, the P2‐Na0.76Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48O2 nano‐necklaces yield fabulous rate capability (125.4 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C with 56.5 mA h g−1 at 20 C) and excellent cyclic stability (≈79% capacity retention after 300 cycles). Additionally, a promising energy density of 177.4 Wh kg−1 is demonstrated in a prototype soft‐package Na‐ion full battery constructed by the tailored nano‐necklaces cathode and hard carbon anode.

However, the electrochemical performance of sodium‐ion full cells (SIFCs) suffers severely from the irreversible consumption of sodium ions of cathode during the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation of hard carbon anode. Here, a high‐efficiency cathode sodiation compensation reagent, sodium oxalate (Na2C2O4), which possesses both a high theoretical capacity of 400 mA h g−1 and a capacity utilization as high as 99%, is proposed. The implementation of Na2C2O4 as sacrificial sodium species is successfully realized by decreasing its oxidation potential from 4.41 to 3.97 V through tuning conductive additives with different physicochemical features, and the corresponding mechanism of oxidation potential manipulation is analyzed. Electrochemical results show that in the full cell based on a hard carbon anode and a P2‐Na2/3Ni1/3Mn1/3Ti1/3O2 cathode with Na2C2O4 as a sodium reservoir to compensate for sodium loss during SEI formation, the capacity retention is increased from 63% to 85% after 200 cycles and the energy density is improved from 129.2 to 172.6 W h kg−1.

NASICON (Na super-ionic conductor)-structured Nax MnM(PO4 )3 materials (M represents transition metal) have drawn increasing attention due to their features of robust crystal framework, low cost, as well as high voltage based on Mn4+ /Mn3+ and Mn3+ /Mn2+ redox couples. However, full activation of Mn4+ /Mn3+ redox couple within NASICON framework is still a great challenge. Herein, a novel NASICON-type Na4 MnCr(PO4 )3 material with highly reversible Mn4+ /Mn3+ redox reaction is discovered. It proceeds a two-step reaction with voltage platforms centered at 4.15 and 3.52 V versus Na+ /Na, delivering a capacity of 108.4 mA h g-1 . The Na4 MnCr(PO4 )3 cathode also exhibits long durability over 500 cycles and impressive rate capability up to 10 C. The galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) test shows fast Na diffusivity which is further verified by density functional theory calculations. The high electrochemical activity derives from the 3D robust framework structure, fast kinetics, and pseudocapacitive contribution. The sodium storage mechanism of the Na4 MnCr(PO4 )3 cathode is deeply studied by ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), revealing that both solid-solution and two-phase reactions are involved in the Na+ ions extraction/insertion process.",

Multiscale electron microscopy and affiliated spectroscopy analyses reveal that in addition to the microscale O3/O'3-P2 core-shell structure, nanoscale coherent P2/O3 intergrown structure can also be identified in the composite. Such well-tailored structures not only constrain the structural damages (microscale cracks) induced by repeated volumetric changes upon desodiation and re-sodiation, but also facilitate fast Na ions diffusion through the exterior P2-type layered structure.

In light of this, the recent development of Prussian blue analogs and sodium superionic conductor (NASICON)-type materials with 3D Na+ diffusion pathways for building high power density NIBs are provided in this perspective.

We synthesize the materials via coprecipitation followed by annealing in air and rinsing with water, and we examine the electrodes as cathodes for sodium-ion batteries using a propylene carbonate-based electrolyte. We fully investigate the effect of the Ni-to-Fe ratio, annealing temperature, and sodium content on the electrochemical performances of the electrodes. The impact of these parameters on the structural and electrochemical properties of the materials is revealed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and cyclic voltammetry, respectively. The suitability of this class of P-type materials for sodium battery application is finally demonstrated by cycling tests revealing an excellent electrochemical performance in terms of delivered capacity (i.e., about 200 mAh g(-1)) and charge-discharge efficiency (approaching 100%).",

        "abstract": "The vital challenge of layered manganese oxide cathode for sodium-ion batteries is its severe capacity degradation and sluggish ion diffusion kinetics caused by irreversible phase transitions. In response to this problem, the spinel-layered manganese-based composite with intergrowth structure is ingeniously designed by virtue of an interesting spinel-to-layered transformation in the delithiated LiMn2O4 under Na+ insertion. This unique spinel-layered intergrowth structure is strongly confirmed by combining multiple structure analysis techniques. The layered component can provide more reversible capacity, while the spinel component is crucial for stabilized the crystal structure and accelerated ions diffusion kinetics. As an appealing cathode for sodium-ion batteries, the layered-spinel composite delivers a high reversible capacity of 180.9 mAh g-1, excellent cycling stability, and superior rate capability with 55.7 mAh g-1 at 12 C. Furthermore, the reaction mechanism upon Na+ extraction/insertion is revealed in detail by ex-situ X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, indicating that Na+ ions can be accommodated by the layered structure at a low voltage and by spinel at a high voltage.

Of particular interest, P2-type layered oxide, Na2/3Fe1/2Mn1/2O2, has been researched as a potential cathode in SIBs based on its high theoretical capacity of 260 mAh/g and use of non-critical materials. However, the reported synthesis methods are not only complex and energy-demanding, but also often yield inhomogeneous and impure materials with capacities less than 200 mAh/g under impractical test conditions. Here, we report a novel synthesis route using low temperature eutectic reaction to produce highly homogeneous and crystalline, and impurity-free P2-NaxFe1/2Mn1/2O2 with enhanced Na-ion diffusivity and kinetics. The overall electrochemical performances of the Na-ion cells have been improved by pairing the P2-cathode with pre-sodiated hard carbon anodes, leading to reversible capacities in the range of 180 mAh/g. This new approach is a contribution towards the simplification of synthesis and scalability of sodium-based cathodes with high crystallinity and fine-tuned morphology, and the realization of a sodium-ion battery system with lower cost and improved electrochemical performance.",

We synthesize an N-doped graphene oxide wrapped Na 3 V(PO 3 ) 3 N composite with a uniform carbon coating layer, and it shows both excellent rate performance and outstanding cycling stability. Its air/water stability and all-climate performance are carefully investigated in detail. Near-zero volume change (~0.40%) is clearly observed for the first time based on in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, and the in-situ X-ray absorption spectra reveal the V 3.2+ /V 4.2+ redox reaction with high reversibility. Its three-dimensional sodium diffusion pathways are explicitly demonstrated with distinctive low energy barriers. Higher reversible capacity and a higher working platform can surely be achieved if the electrolyte possesses a wider voltage tolerance window above 4.8 V.

Herein, we devise a scaled-up electrospinning avenue to fabricate nanocrystal-constructed ultralong layered NaCrO2 nanowires (NWs) toward SIBs as a wide-temperature-operating cathode. The resultant one-dimensional (1D) NaCrO2 nanoarchitecture is endowed with orientated and shortened electronic/ionic transport and remarkable structural tolerance to stress change over sodiation-desodiation processes. Benefiting from these structural superiorities, the NaCrO2 NWs are featured with prominent Na+-storage behaviors in the wide-operating-temperature range from -15 to 55 °C. Promisingly, the NaCrO2 NWs exhibit extraordinary high-rate capacities of ∼108.8 and ∼87.2 mAh g-1 at 10 and 50 C rates at 25 °C, and even 94.6 (55 °C) and ∼60.1 (-15 °C) mAh g-1 at 10 C, along with outstanding cyclic stabilities with capacity retentions of ∼80.6% (-15 °C), 88.4% (25 °C), and ∼86.9% (55 °C). The overall performance of our NaCrO2 is superior to other reported NaCrO2-based cathodes, even with conductive nanocarbon coating. Encouragingly, a competitive energy density of ∼161 Wh kg-1 can be obtained by the NaCrO2 NWs-based full cell.

The multiple characterization investigations reveal that Ru substitution could improve the electronic and ionic conductions and particularly suppress the phase transition of P2-OP4, resulting in the extension of the single-phase reaction region. Ru substitution not only enhances the specific capacity (209.3 mA h g-1) but also improves the rate capability (∼100 mA h g-1 at 50 C) and cycling stability.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have huge potential in large-scale energy storage applications. Layered Fe-based oxides are one of the desirable cathode materials due to abundance in the earth crust and high activity in electrochemical processes. However, Fe-ion migration to Na layers is one of the major hurdles leading to irreversible structural degradation. Herein, it is revealed that distinct Fe-ion migration in cycling NaFeO2 (NFO) should be mainly responsible for the strong local lattice strain and resulting particle cracks, all of which results in the deterioration of electrochemical performance. More importantly, a strategy of Ru doping could effectively suppress the Fe-ion migration and then reduce the local lattice strain and the particle cracks, finally to greatly enhance the sodium storage performance. Atomic-scale characterization shows that NFO electrode after cycling presents the intense lattice strain locally, accompanied by the remarkable particle cracks. Whereas, Ru-doped NFO electrode maintains the well-ordered layered structure by inhibiting the Fe-O distortion, so as to eliminate the resulting side effect. As a result, Ru-doped NFO could greatly improve the comprehensive electrochemical performance by delivering a reversible capacity of 120 mA h g-1 , about 80% capacity retention after 100 cycles. The findings provide new insights for designing high-performance electrodes for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the substitution of inactive elements has been reported as a promising strategy for improving the structural stability and electrochemical performance of layered cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). In this regard, we have investigated the positive effects of inactive Ti substitution into O3-type NaFe0.25Ni0.25Mn0.5O2, based on first principles calculations and electrochemical experiments. After Ti substitution, Na[Ti0.03(Fe0.25Ni0.25Mn0.5)0.97]O2 exhibits improved capacity retention and rate capability compared with Ti-free NaFe0.25Ni0.25Mn0.5O2. Such improvement is primarily attributed to the enhanced structural stability and lowered activation energy for Na+ migration, induced by Ti substitution in the host structure. Based on the first principles calculations of the average net charges and partial densities of states, we suggest that Ti substitution effectively enhances the binding between transition metals and oxygen by increasing the oxygen electron density, which in turn lowers the energy barrier of Na+ migration, leading to a notable enhancement in the rate capability of Na[Ti0.03(Fe0.25Ni0.25Mn0.5)0.97]O2. Compared with other inactive elements (e.g. Al and Mg), Ti is a more suitable substituent for improving the electrochemical properties of layered cathode materials because of its large total charge variation contributing to capacity. The results of this study should provide a practical guideline for developing highly reliable layered cathode materials for SIBs.",

Through ex situ X-ray diffraction, co-substitution is demonstrated to be effective in enhancing the reversibility of P3-P3″ phase transition from 4.0 to 4.4 V. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicates that higher electronic conductivity is achieved by co-substitution. Moreover, cyclic voltammetry and the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique demonstrate faster kinetics for Na+ diffusion due to the co-substitution. This study provides a reference for further improvement of electrochemical performance of cathode materials for high-voltage sodium-ion batteries.",

Among them, sodium iron fluorophosphate (Na2 FePO4 F) is widely noted due to its layered structure and high operating voltage compared with NaFePO4 . Here, a mesoporous Na2 FePO4 F@C (M-NFPF@C) composite derived from mesoporous FePO4 is synthesized through a facile ball-milling combined calcination method.

The high plateau capacity obtained (>90% of total capacity) not only shows high electrochemical reversibility of the as-prepared M-NFPF@C but also provides high energy density, which mainly originates from its mesoporous structure derived from the mesoporous FePO4 precursor.

        "abstract": "All‐solid‐state sodium ion batteries (AS3iBs) are highly sought after for stationary energy storage systems due to their suitable safety and stability over a wide temperature range. Hard carbon (HC), which is low cost, exhibits a low redox potential, and a high capacity, is integral to achieve a practical large‐scale sodium‐ion battery. However, the energy density of the battery utilizing this anode material is hampered by its low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). Herein, two strategies, namely i) additional pyrolysis and ii) presodiation by thermal decomposition of NaBH4, are explored to improve the ICE of pristine HC. Raman spectroscopy, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrochemical characterizations elucidate that the thermal treatment increases the Csp2 content in the HC structure, while the presodiation supplies the sodium to occupy the intrinsic irreversible sites. Consequently, presodiated HC exhibits an outstanding ICE (>99%) compared to the thermally treated (90%) or pristine HC (83%) in half‐cell configurations. More importantly, AS3iB using presodiated HC and NaCrO2 as the anode and cathode, respectively, exhibits a high ICE of 92% and an initial discharge energy density of 294Whkgcathode−1$294\\ {\\rm Wh}\\ {\\rm{kg}}_{{\\rm{cathode}}}^{ - 1}$ .",

Based on the combined analyses of cyclic voltammograms, ex situ X‐ray absorption spectroscopy, and operando X‐ray diffraction, the reaction mechanisms behind the superior electrochemical performance are clearly articulated. Surprisingly, Ni2+/Ni3+ and Cu2+/Cu3+ redox couples are simultaneously involved in the charge compensation with a highly reversible O3–P3 phase transition during charge/discharge process and the Na+ storage is governed by a capacitive mechanism via quantitative kinetics analysis.

To enlarge the alkali-layer distance inside the layer structure of NaNFM may benefit Na+ diffusion. Herein, the effect of Ca-substitution is reported in Na sites on the structural and electrochemical properties of Na1-x Cax/2 NFM (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared Na1-x Cax/2 NFM samples show single α-NaFeO2 type phase with slightly increased alkali-layer distance as Ca content increases.

It is reported that dopant aggregation effectively boosts the cyclability of a Mg‐doped P2‐type layered cathode (Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2). Experimental characterization and calculation consistently reveal that randomly distributed Mg dopants tend to segregate into the Na‐layer during high‐voltage cycling, leading to the formation of high‐density precipitates. Intriguingly, such Mg‐enriched precipitates, acting as 3D network pillars, can further enhance a material's mechanical strength, suppress cracking, and consequently benefit cyclability. This work not only deepens the understanding on dopant evolution but also offers a conceptually new approach by utilizing precipitation strengthening design to counter cracking related degradation and improve high‐voltage cyclability of layered cathodes.",

Operando X-ray diffraction study indicates that a single-phase reaction is associated with the insertion of sodium ions into the structure, accompanied by a small volume change approximately 3%. Furthermore, ex situ X-ray diffraction, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy results show that crystal structure remained after continuous 300 cycles.

A group of P2-type cathodes containing various amounts of Ti is prepared using a facile synthetic method. These cathodes show different behaviors of the Na+/vacancy ordering. Na0.67CoO2 suffers severe capacity loss at high voltages due to irreversible structure changes causing serious polarization, while the Ti-substituted cathodes have long credible cycleability as well as high energy. In particular, Na0.67Co0.90Ti0.10O2 exhibits excellent capacity retention (115 mAh g-1) even after 100 cycles, whereas Na0.67CoO2 exhibits negligible capacity retention (<10 mAh g-1) at 4.5 V cutoff conditions. Na0.67Co0.90Ti0.10O2 also exhibits outstanding rate capabilities of 108 mAh g-1 at a current density of 1000 mA g-1 (7.4 C). Increased sodium diffusion kinetics from mitigated Na+/vacancy ordering, which allows high Na+ utilization, are investigated to find in detail the mechanism of the improvement by combining systematic analyses comprising TEM, in situ XRD, and electrochemical methods.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we developed a doping technology capable of improving the electrochemical performance, including the rate capability and cycling stability, of P2-type Na0.67Fe0.5Mn0.5O2 as a cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. Our approach involved using titanium as a doping element to partly substitute either Fe or Mn in Na0.67Fe0.5Mn0.5O2. The Ti-substituted Na0.67Fe0.5Mn0.5O2 shows superior electrochemical properties compared to the pristine sample. We investigated the changes in the crystal structure, surface chemistry, and particle morphology caused by Ti doping and correlated these changes to the improved performance. The enhanced rate capability and cycling stability were attributed to the enlargement of the NaO2 slab in the crystal structure because of Ti doping. This promoted Na-ion diffusion and prevented the phase transition from the P2 to the OP4/″Z″ structure.",

Herein, we report high crystalline and Na-rich Prussian white Na2 CoFe(CN)6 nanocubes synthesized by an optimized and facile co-precipitation method. The influence of crystallinity and sodium content on the electrochemical properties was systematically investigated. The optimized Na2 CoFe(CN)6 nanocubes exhibited an initial capacity of 151 mA h g-1 , which is close to its theoretical capacity (170 mA h g-1 ). Meanwhile, the Na2 CoFe(CN)6 cathode demonstrated an outstanding long-term cycle performance, retaining 78 % of its initial capacity after 500 cycles. Furthermore, the Na2 CoFe(CN)6 Prussian white nanocubes also achieved a superior rate capability (115 mA h g-1 at 400 mA g-1 , 92 mA h g-1 at 800 mA g-1 ). The enhanced performances could be attributed to the robust crystal structure and rapid transport of Na ions through large channels in the open-framework. Most noteworthy, the as-prepared Na2 CoFe(CN)6 nanocubes are not only low-cost in raw materials but also contain a rich sodium content (1.87 Na ions per lattice unit cell), which will be favorable for full cell fabrication and large-scale electric storage applications.",

In this work, considering the beneficial synergistic effects of layered P2/P3 and Fd3[combining macron]m spinel phases, a stable layered/spinel intergrowth nanocomposite Na0.5[Ni0.2Co0.15Mn0.65]O2 is rationally designed and successfully prepared via a co-precipitation route and a subsequent solid-state reaction, and the triphase synergy in this layered/spinel nanocomposite is demonstrated. In Na/Na0.5[Ni0.2Co0.15Mn0.65]O2 half-cells, it delivers a high specific capacity of ∼180 mA h g-1 and a good cycling stability, with a capacity retention of 87.6% after 100 cycles, at a rate of 0.1C between 1.5 and 4.0 V (vs. Na/Na+). The large reversible capacity of 105 mA h g-1 is also achieved even at a high rate of 10C, indicating high-rate capability. Besides, the full-cells using this nanocomposite as the cathode and hard carbon as the anode exhibit long-term cycle-life and high-power properties, indicating the expected merits of layered/spinel mixed phases. The superior sodium storage performance of this layered P3/P2 and spinel intergrowth nanocomposite makes it a promising candidate as a long-life and high-rate cathode for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) receive significant attention for electrochemical energy storage and conversion owing to their wide availability and the low cost of Na resources. However, SIBs face challenges of low specific energy, short cycling life, and insufficient specific power, owing to the heavy mass and large radius of Na+ ions. As an important component of SIBs, cathode materials have a significant effect on the SIB electrochemical performance. The most recent advances and prospects of inorganic and organic cathode materials are summarized here. Among current cathode materials, layered transition‐metal oxides achieve high specific energies around 600 mW h g−1 owing to their high specific capacities of 180–220 mA h g−1 and their moderate operating potentials of 2.7–3.2 V (vs Na+/Na). Porous Na3V2(PO4)3/C nanomaterials exhibit excellent cycling performance with almost 100% retention over 1000 cycles owing to their robust structural framework. Recent emerging cathode materials, such as amorphous NaFePO4 and pteridine derivatives show interesting electrochemical properties and attractive prospects for application in SIBs. Future work should focus on strategies to enhance the overall performance of cathode materials in terms of specific energy, cycling life, and rate capability with cationic doping, anionic substitution, morphology fabrication, and electrolyte matching.",

        "abstract": "Rechargeable sodium‐ion batteries are proposed as the most appropriate alternative to lithium batteries due to the fast consumption of the limited lithium resources. Due to their improved safety, polyanion framework compounds have recently gained attention as potential candidates. With the earth‐abundant element Fe being the redox center, the uniform carbon‐coated Na3.32Fe2.34(P2O7)2/C composite represents a promising alternative for sodium‐ion batteries. The electrochemical results show that the as‐prepared Na3.32Fe2.34(P2O7)2/C composite can deliver capacity of ≈100 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C (1 C = 120 mA g−1), with capacity retention of 92.3% at 0.5 C after 300 cycles. After adding fluoroethylene carbonate additive to the electrolyte, 89.6% of the initial capacity is maintained, even after 1100 cycles at 5 C. The electrochemical mechanism is systematically investigated via both in situ synchrotron X‐ray diffraction and density functional theory calculations. The results show that the sodiation and desodiation are single‐phase‐transition processes with two 1D sodium paths, which facilitates fast ionic diffusion. A small volume change, nearly 100% first‐cycle Coulombic efficiency, and a pseudocapacitance contribution are also demonstrated. This research indicates that this new compound could be a potential competitor for other iron‐based cathode electrodes for application in large‐scale Na rechargeable batteries.",

It is also found that a light change on the local electronic and structural states or phase change could be observed after the first cycle, resulting in the fast capacity fade at room temperature.

Herein, one new P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn5/9Al1/9O2 (NMA) cathode material is successfully prepared via a simple and facile liquid-state method. The prepared NMA is layered transition metal oxide, which can keep stable crystal structure during sodiation/desodiation as demonstrated by the ex situ X-ray diffraction, and its electrochemical properties can be further enhanced by connecting the cake-like NMA microparticles with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) using a ball milling method. Electrochemical tests show that the formed RGO-connected NMA (NMA/RGO) can deliver a higher reversible capacity of up to 138 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and also exhibit a superior high-rate capabilities and cycling stability in comparison to pure NMA. The much improved properties should be attributed to the reduced particle size and improvement of electrical conductivity and apparent Na(+) diffusion due to RGO incorporation, which is comprehensively verified by the electrochemical technologies of galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry at various scan rate as well as ex-situ X-ray diffraction studies.",

With the substitution of Co(3+) for Ni(2+) the lattice parameter a decreases; however, c increases, and the d-spacing of the sodium-ion diffusion layer has been enlarged, which enhances the diffusion coefficient of the sodium ion and the high-rate capability of cathode materials. In addition, Co substitution shortens the bond lengths of TM-O (TM = transition metal) and O-O due to the smaller size of Co(3+) than Ni(2+), which accounts for the decreased thickness and volume of the TMO6 octahedron. The contraction of TM-O and O-O bond lengths and the shrinkage of the TMO6 octahedron improve the structure stability and the cycle performance. Last but not least, the aliovalent substitution of Co(3+) for Ni(2+) can improve the electronic conductivity during the electrochemical reaction, which is also favorable to enhance the high-rate performance. This study not only unveils the role of Co in improving the high-rate capability and the cycle stability of layered Na0.7Mn0.7Ni0.3-xCoxO2 cathode materials but also offers some new insights into designing high performance cathode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Although sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the electrochemical performances, in particular the energy density, are much lower than LIBs. A metal-organic compound, cuprous 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (CuTCNQ), is presented as a new kind of cathode material for SIBs. It consists of both cationic (CuII ↔CuI ) and anionic (TCNQ0 ↔TCNQ- ↔ TCNQ2- ) reversible redox reactions, delivering a discharge capacity as high as 255 mAh g-1 at a current density of 20 mA g-1 . The synergistic effect of both redox-active metal cations and organic anions brings an electrochemical transfer of multiple electrons. The transformation of cupric ions to cuprous ions occurs at near 3.80 V vs. Na+ /Na, while the full reduction of TCNQ0 to TCNQ- happens at 3.00-3.30 V. The remarkably high voltage is attributed to the strong inductive effect of the four cyano groups.",

        "abstract": "Developing sodium‐ion batteries for large‐scale energy storage applications is facing big challenges of the lack of high‐performance cathode materials. Here, a series of new cathode materials Na0.66CoxMn0.66–xTi0.34O2 for sodium‐ion batteries are designed and synthesized aiming to reduce transition metal‐ion ordering, charge ordering, as well as Na+ and vacancy ordering. An interesting structure change of Na0.66CoxMn0.66–xTi0.34O2 from orthorhombic to hexagonal is revealed when Co content increases from x = 0 to 0.33. In particular, Na0.66Co0.22Mn0.44Ti0.34O2 with a P2‐type layered structure delivers a reversible capacity of 120 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C. When the current density increases to 10 C, a reversible capacity of 63.2 mAh g−1 can still be obtained, indicating a promising rate capability. The low valence Co2+ substitution results in the formation of average Mn3.7+ valence state in Na0.66Co0.22Mn0.44Ti0.34O2, effectively suppressing the Mn3+‐induced Jahn–Teller distortion, and in turn stabilizing the layered structure. X‐ray absorption spectroscopy results suggest that the charge compensation of Na0.66Co0.22Mn0.44Ti0.34O2 during charge/discharge is contributed by Co2.2+/Co3+ and Mn3.3+/Mn4+ redox couples. This is the first time that the highly reversible Co2+/Co3+ redox couple is observed in P2‐layered cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries. This finding may open new approaches to design advanced intercalation‐type cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "Prussian blue and its analogues have received particular attention as superior cathodes for Na-ion batteries due to their potential 2-Na storage capacity (∼170 mAh g(-1)) and low cost. However, most of the Prussian blue compounds obtained from the conventional synthetic routes contain large amounts of Fe(CN)6 vacancies and coordinated water molecules, which leads to the collapse of cyano-bridged framework and serious deterioration of their Na-storage ability. Herein, we propose a facile citrate-assisted controlled crystallization method to obtain low-defect Prussian blue lattice with greatly improved Na-storage capacity and cycling stability. As an example, the as-prepared Na2CoFe(CN)6 nanocrystals demonstrate a reversible 2-Na storage reaction with a high specific capacity of 150 mAh g(-1) and a ∼ 90% capacity retention over 200 cycles, possibly serving as a low cost and high performance cathode for Na-ion batteries.

Nonetheless, its application faces a number of obstacles due to poor electronic conductivity and structural instability. In this work, Fe-HCF nanospheres (NSs) were first synthesized and fabricated by an in situ graphene rolls (GRs) wrapping method, forming a 1D tubular hierarchical structure of Fe-HCF NSs@GRs. GRs not only provide fast electronic conduction path for Fe-HCF NSs but also effectively prevent organic electrolyte from reaching active materials and inhibit the occurrence of side reactions. The Fe-HCF NSs@GRs composite has been used as a binder-free cathode with a capacity of ∼110 mAh g-1 at a current density of 150 mA g-1 (∼1C), the capacity retention of ∼90% after 500 cycles. Moreover, the Fe-HCF NSs@GRs cathode displays a super high rate capability with ∼95 mAh g-1 at 1500 mA g-1 (∼10C).

This key issue must be addressed in order to develop high-performance cathodes for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we present a comprehensive study on the influence of Al doping of Mn sites on the structural and electrochemical properties of a P2-Na0.5Mn0.5-xAlxCo0.5O2 (x = 0, 0.02, or 0.05) cathode for SIBs. Detailed structural, morphological, and electrochemical investigations were carried out using X-ray diffraction, cyclic voltammetry, and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements, and some new insights are proposed. Rietveld refinement confirmed that Al doping caused TMO6 octahedra (TM = transition metal) shrinkage, resulting in wider interlayer spacing. After optimizing the aluminum concentration, the cathode exhibited remarkable electrochemical performance, with better stability and improved rate performance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed at various states of charge to probe the surface and bulk effects of Al doping. The material presented here exhibits exceptional stability over 100 cycles within a 1.5-4.3 V window and outperforms several other Mn-Co-based cathodes for SIBs.

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are considered one of the most promising alternatives for large-scale energy storage due largely to the abundance and low cost of sodium. However, the lack of high-performance cathode materials at low cost represents a major obstacle toward broad commercialization of SIB technology. In this work, we report a green route strategy that allows cost-effective fabrication of carbon-coated Na2FePO4F cathode for SIBs. By using vitamin C as a green organic carbon source and environmentally friendly water-based polyacrylic latex as the binder, we have demonstrated that the Na2FePO4F phase in the as-derived Na2FePO4F/C electrode shows a high reversible capacity of 117 mAh g-1 at a cycling rate of 0.1 C. More attractively, excellent rate capability is achieved while retaining outstanding cycling stability (∼85% capacity retention after 1000 charge-discharge cycles at a rate of 4 C). Further, in operando X-ray diffraction has been used to probe the evolution of phase structures during the charge-discharge process, confirming the structural robustness of the Na2FePO4F/C cathode (even when charged to 4.5 V). Accordingly, the poor initial Coulombic efficiency of some anode materials may be compensated by extracting more sodium ions from Na2FePO4F/C cathode at higher potentials (up to 4.5 V).",

Here, through a hydrogel-embedding method, we are able to confine the growth of few-layer SnS2 nanosheets between nitrogen- and sulfur-doped carbon nanotube (NS-CNT) and amorphous carbon. The obtained carbon-sandwiched SnS2 nanosheets demonstrate excellent sodium storage properties. In operando small angle X-ray scattering combined with the ex situ X-ray absorption near edge spectra reveal that the redox reactions between SnS2/NS-CNT and sodium ion are highly reversible. On the contrary, the nanostructure evolution is found to be irreversible, in which the SnS2 nanosheets collapse, followed by the re-generation of SnS2 nanoparticles. This work provides operando insights into the chemical environment evolution and structure change of SnS2-based anodes, elucidating its reversible reaction mechanism, and illustrates the significance of engineered carbon support in ensuring the electrode structure stability.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Aromatic organic compounds can be used as electrode materials in rechargeable batteries and are expected to advance the development of both anode and cathode materials for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, most aromatic organic compounds assessed as anode materials in SIBs to date exhibit significant degradation issues under fast‐charge/discharge conditions and unsatisfying long‐term cycling performance. Now, a molecular design concept is presented for improving the stability of organic compounds for battery electrodes. The molecular design of the investigated compound, [2.2.2.2]paracyclophane‐1,9,17,25‐tetraene (PCT), can stabilize the neutral state by local aromaticity and the doubly reduced state by global aromaticity, resulting in an anode material with extraordinarily stable cycling performance and outstanding performance under fast‐charge/discharge conditions, demonstrating an exciting new path for the development of electrode materials for SIBs and other types of batteries.",

The electrochemical reactivity of NaNi(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(2) is examined in an aprotic sodium cell at room temperature. The NaNi(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(2) electrodes can deliver ca. 105-125 mAh g(-1) at rates of 240-4.8 mA g(-1) in the voltage range of 2.2-3.8 V and show 75% of the initial reversible capacity after 50 charge/discharge cycling tests. In the voltage range of 2.2-4.5 V, a higher reversible capacity of 185 mAh g(-1) is achieved; however, its reversibility is insufficient because of the significant expansion of interslab space by charging to 4.5 V versus sodium. The reversbility is improved by adding fluoroethylene carbonate into the electrolyte solution. The structural transition mechanism of Na(1-x)Ni(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(2) is also examined by an ex situ X-ray diffraction method combined with X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The staking sequence of the [Ni(0.5)Mn(0.5)]O(2) slabs changes progressively as sodium ions are extracted from the crystal lattice. It is observed that the original O3 phase transforms into the O'3, P3, P'3, and P3\" phases during sodium extraction. XAS measurement proves that NaNi(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(2) consists of divalent nickel and tetravalent manganese ions. As sodium ions are extracted from the oxide to form Na(1-x)Ni(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(2), nickel ions are oxidized to the trivalent state, while the manganese ions are electrochemically inactive as the tetravalent state.",

        "abstract": "Due to their low yield and easy aggregation during the electrode preparation process, exfoliated MoS2 monolayers cannot fulfill the requirements of alkali-metal-ion battery tests. Hence, we have developed a facile process to fabricate powder exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets capable of large-scale production and having highly monolayer-rich structures. This process contains two steps: liquid-phase exfoliation of the edge-rich MoS2 precursor and a freeze-drying procedure. The proposed MoS2 precursors contain rich edge fractions that are easily exfoliated by this method, and the freeze-drying procedure can maintain the unique monolayer-rich structure of MoS2 in the powder phase. The electrochemical evaluations of both lithium- and sodium-ion batteries reveal that the proposed powder exfoliated monolayer-rich MoS2 electrode exhibits remarkable specific capacities and stable cyclic performances. In particular, the monolayer-rich MoS2 nanosheet electrode delivers a superior lithium-storage capacity of ∼1400 mA h g-1. The exfoliated MoS2 nanosheet electrode can withstand over 1000 cycles even at 1 A g-1. The mechanism reveals that these unique MoS2 nanosheets not only have a large surface area but also their inclusive monolayer structures exhibit much higher charge mobility than those of bulk MoS2.",

        "abstract": "Polyanionic Na3V2(PO4)2F3 with a NASICON‐type structure is heralded as a promising cathode material for sodium‐ion batteries due to its fast ionic conduction, high working voltage, and favorable structural stability. However, a number of challenging issues remain regarding its rate capability and cycle life, which must be addressed to enable greater application compatibility. Here, a facile and effective approach that can be used to overcome these disadvantages by introducing an aqueous carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binder is reported. The resulting conductive network serves to accelerate the diffusion of Na+ ions across the interface as well as in the bulk. The strong binding force of the CMC and stable solid permeable interface protect the electrode from degradation, leading to an excellent capacity of 75 mA h g−1 at an ultrahigh rate of 70 C (1 C = 128 mA g−1) and a long lifespan of 3500 cycles at 30 C while sustaining 79% of the initial capacity value. A full cell based on this electrode material delivers an impressive energy density as high as 216 W h kg−1, indicating the potential for application of this straightforward and cost‐effective route for the future development of advanced battery technologies.",

Herein we report chemical functionalization in MoS2 nanosheets with polymer-derived silicon oxycarbide or SiOC with the aim to preserve MoS2 from dissolution in the SIB organic electrolyte, without compromising its role in sodiation and desodiation processes.

        "abstract": "Growing concerns regarding the safety, flammability and hazards posed by Li-ion systems have led to research on alternative rechargeable metal-ion electrochemical storage technologies. Among the most notable of these are Na-ion supercapacitors and batteries, motivated, in part, by the similar electrochemistry of Li and Na ions. However, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) come with their own set of issues, especially the large size of the Na+ ion, its relatively sluggish kinetics and low energy densities. This makes the development of novel materials and appropriate electrode architecture of absolute significance. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted a lot of attention in this regard due to their relative ease of exfoliation, diverse morphologies and architectures with superior electronic properties. Here, we study the electrochemical performance of Mo-based two-dimensional (2D) layered TMDs (e.g. MoS2, MoSe2 and MoTe2), exfoliated in a superacid, for battery and supercapacitor applications. The exfoliated TMD flakes were interfaced with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to be used as composite electrodes. Electron microscopy, elemental mapping and Raman spectra were used to analyse the exfoliated material and confirm the formation of 2D TMD/rGO layer morphology. For supercapacitor applications in aqueous electrolyte, the sulfide-based TMD (MoS2) exhibited the best performance, providing an areal capacitance of 60.25 mF cm−2. For SIB applications, TMD electrodes exhibited significantly higher charge capacities than the neat rGO electrode. The initial desodiation capacities for the composite electrodes are 468.84 mAh g−1 (1687.82 C g−1), 399.10 mAh g−1 (1436.76 C g−1) and 387.36 mAh g−1 (1394.49 C g−1) for MoS2, MoSe2 and MoTe2, respectively. Also, the MoS2 and MoSe2 composite electrodes provided a coulombic efficiency of near 100 % after a few initial cycles.",

A dominant pseudocapacitance contribution is identified and verified by kinetics analysis. In addition, the amorphization and conversion reactions during the electrochemical process of the mesoporous NiS2 nanospheres is also investigated by in situ X-ray diffraction.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion battery (SIB) as one of the most promising large-scale energy storage devices has drawn great attention in recent years. However, the development of SIBs is limited by the lacking of proper anodes with long cycling lifespans and large reversible capacities. Here we present rational synthesis of Rayleigh-instability-induced bismuth nanorods encapsulated in N-doped carbon nanotubes (Bi@N-C) using Bi2S3 nanobelts as the template for high-performance SIB. The Bi@N-C electrode delivers superior sodium storage performance in half cells, including a high specific capacity (410 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1), long cycling lifespan (1000 cycles), and superior rate capability (368 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1). When coupled with homemade Na3V2(PO4)3/C in full cells, this electrode also exhibits excellent performances with high power density of 1190 W kg-1 and energy density of 119 Wh kg-1total. The exceptional performance of Bi@N-C is ascribed to the unique nanorod@nanotube structure, which can accommodate volume expansion of Bi during cycling and stabilize the solid electrolyte interphase layer and improve the electronic conductivity.",

However, the practical application of SIBs is still hindered by the low working voltage, poor rate performance, and insufficient cycling stability. A sodium-ion based full battery using a multi-ion design is now presented. The optimized full batteries delivered a high working voltage of about 4.0 V, which is the best result of reported sodium-ion full batteries. Moreover, this multi-ion battery exhibited good rate performance up to 30 C and a high capacity retention of 95 % over 500 cycles at 5 C. Although the electrochemical performance of this multi-ion battery may be further enhanced via optimizing electrolyte and electrode materials for example, the results presented clearly indicate the feasibility of this multi-ion strategy to improve the electrochemical performance of SIBs for possible energy storage applications.",

Among the many potential candidates, layered compounds such as MoS2 have attracted increasing attention. However, such materials have not yet fulfilled their true potential. Here, we show that networks of liquid phase exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets, reinforced with 20 wt % single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), can be formed into sodium-ion battery electrodes with large gravimetric, volumetric, and areal capacity. The MoS2/SWNT composite films are highly porous, electrically conductive, and mechanically robust due to its percolating carbon nanotube network. When directly employed as the working electrode, they exhibit a specific capacity of >400 mAh/g and volumetric capacity of ∼650 mAh/cm(3). Their mechanical stability allows them to be processed into free-standing films with tunable thickness up to ∼100 μm, corresponding to an areal loading of 15 mg/cm(2). Their high electrical conductivity allows the high volumetric capacity to be retained, even at high thickness, resulting in state-of-the-art areal capacities of >4.0 mAh/cm(2). Such values are competitive with their lithium-ion counterparts.",

        "abstract": "A sodium-ion battery (SIB) solution is attractive for grid-scale electrical energy storage. Low-cost hexacyanometalate is a promising electrode material for SIBs because of its easy synthesis and open framework. Most hexacyanometalate-based SIBs work with aqueous electrolyte, and interstitial water in the material has been found to strongly affect the electrochemical profile, but the mechanism remains elusive. Here we provide a comparative study of the transition-metal redox in hexacyanometalate electrodes with and without interstitial water based on soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. We found distinct transition-metal redox sequences in hydrated and anhydrated NaxMnFe(CN)6·zH2O. The Fe and Mn redox in hydrated electrodes are separated and are at different potentials, leading to two voltage plateaus. On the contrary, mixed Fe and Mn redox in the same potential range is found in the anhydrated system. This work reveals for the first time how transition-metal redox in batteries is strongly affected by interstitial molecules that are seemingly spectators. The results suggest a fundamental mechanism based on three competing factors that determine the transition-metal redox potentials. Because most hexacyanometalate electrodes contain water, this work directly reveals the mechanism of how interstitial molecules could define the electrochemical profile, especially for electrodes based on transition-metal redox with well-defined spin states.",

Among possible anode materials, Sb is one of the interesting candidates due to a combination of battery-type potential plateaus in the charge-discharge profiles, high capacity (theoretical capacity of 660 mAh g-1), and demonstrated good cyclic stability. The influence of Sb particle size (particularly at the nanoscale range) and the composition of Sb-carbon composites on the electrode performance, stability, and charge storage mechanism is systematically evaluated here for the first time. A range of Sb-carbon nanocomposites with varied Sb particle size (between 50 and ∼1 nm) are studied. The control of the particle size is achieved via varying the carbon and Sb weight ratio in the precursors. The shape of charge-discharge profiles, hysteresis, and the difference in cyclic stabilities and rate performance are analyzed. The nanocomposite with the smallest particle size (∼1 nm) and the largest carbon content provides the most stable cyclic behavior and a better rate capability but suffers from an increased hysteresis between charge and discharge curves. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments indicate that the storage mechanism in the Sb-carbon nanocomposites containing Sb nanoparticles is different from the electrodes with bulkier, micron-sized Sb particles, and the electrochemical reaction proceeds through a number of crystalline intermediates.",

Here, taking SnS as a model material, a novel general strategy is proposed to fabricate a 3D porous interconnected metal sulfide/carbon nanocomposite by the electrostatic spray deposition technique without adding any expensive carbonaceous materials such as graphene or carbon nanotube. In this way, small nanorods of SnS are generated with sizes of ≈10–20 nm embedded in amorphous carbon and self‐assembled into a 3D porous interconnected nanocomposite. The SnS:C is directly deposited on the Ti foil as a current collector and neither conductive additives nor binder are needed for battery assembly.

Here, we present a direct synthesis of ferrite/carbon hybrid nanosheets for high performance lithium-ion battery anodes. Uniform-sized ferrite nanocrystals and carbon materials were synthesized simultaneously through a single heating procedure using metal-oleate complex as the precursors for both ferrite and carbon. 2-D nanostructures were obtained by using sodium sulfate salt powder as a sacrificial template. The 2-D ferrite/carbon nanocomposites exhibited excellent cycling stability and rate performance derived from 2-D nanostructural characteristics. The synthetic procedure is simple, inexpensive, and scalable for mass production, and the highly ordered 2-D structure of these nanocomposites has great potential for many future applications.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries utilize various electrode materials derived from lithium batteries. However, the different characteristics inherent in sodium may cause unexpected cell reactions and battery performance. Thus, identifying the reactive discrepancy between sodiation and lithiation is essential for fundamental understanding and practical engineering of battery materials. Here we reveal a heterogeneous sodiation mechanism of iron fluoride (FeF2) nanoparticle electrodes by combining in situ/ex situ microscopy and spectroscopy techniques. In contrast to direct one-step conversion reaction with lithium, the sodiation of FeF2 proceeds via a regular conversion on the surface and a disproportionation reaction in the core, generating a composite structure of 1-4 nm ultrafine Fe nanocrystallites (further fused into conductive frameworks) mixed with an unexpected Na3FeF6 phase and a NaF phase in the shell. These findings demonstrate a core-shell reaction mode of the sodiation process and shed light on the mechanistic understanding extended to generic electrode materials for both Li- and Na-ion batteries.",

        "title": "Biologically derived melanin electrodes in aqueous sodium-ion energy storage devices",
        "abstract": "Significance Here we present important findings related to biologically derived pigments for potential use as battery electrodes. Namely, we report the synthesis, fabrication, and characterization of melanins as materials for use in aqueous sodium-ion batteries. We demonstrate the use of naturally occurring melanins as active electrode materials in charge storage devices. Furthermore, the performance of melanin anodes is comparable to many commonly available synthetic organic electrode materials. The structure–property relationships that govern the storage capacity in melanin materials were also elucidated. These findings suggest that the unique chemistry and nanostructure in natural melanins increase the charge storage capacity compared with synthetic melanin analogues. Biodegradable electronics represents an attractive and emerging paradigm in medical devices by harnessing simultaneous advantages afforded by electronically active systems and obviating issues with chronic implants. Integrating practical energy sources that are compatible with the envisioned operation of transient devices is an unmet challenge for biodegradable electronics. Although high-performance energy storage systems offer a feasible solution, toxic materials and electrolytes present regulatory hurdles for use in temporary medical devices. Aqueous sodium-ion charge storage devices combined with biocompatible electrodes are ideal components to power next-generation biodegradable electronics. Here, we report the use of biologically derived organic electrodes composed of melanin pigments for use in energy storage devices. Melanins of natural (derived from Sepia officinalis) and synthetic origin are evaluated as anode materials in aqueous sodium-ion storage devices. Na+-loaded melanin anodes exhibit specific capacities of 30.4 ± 1.6 mAhg−1. Full cells composed of natural melanin anodes and λ-MnO2 cathodes exhibit an initial potential of 1.03 ± 0.06 V with a maximum specific capacity of 16.1 ± 0.8 mAhg−1. Natural melanin anodes exhibit higher specific capacities compared with synthetic melanins due to a combination of beneficial chemical, electrical, and physical properties exhibited by the former. Taken together, these results suggest that melanin pigments may serve as a naturally occurring biologically derived charge storage material to power certain types of medical devices.",

        "abstract": "Nanocrystals with quantum-confined length scales are often considered impractical for metal-ion battery electrodes due to the dominance of solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer effects on the measured storage properties. Here we demonstrate that ultrafine sizes (∼4.5 nm, average) of iron pyrite, or FeS2, nanoparticles are advantageous to sustain reversible conversion reactions in sodium ion and lithium ion batteries. This is attributed to a nanoparticle size comparable to or smaller than the diffusion length of Fe during cation exchange, yielding thermodynamically reversible nanodomains of converted Fe metal and NaxS or LixS conversion products. This is compared to bulk-like electrode materials, where kinetic and thermodynamic limitations of surface-nucleated conversion products inhibit successive conversion cycles. Reversible capacities over 500 and 600 mAh/g for sodium and lithium storage are observed for ultrafine nanoparticles, with improved cycling and rate capability. Unlike alloying or intercalation processes, where SEI effects limit the performance of ultrafine nanoparticles, our work highlights the benefit of quantum dot length-scale nanocrystal electrodes for nanoscale metal sulfide compounds that store energy through chemical conversion reactions.",

With electric current passing through, sodium and chloride ions are released or absorbed by two aerogel electrodes. This system achieves super high desalination capacity, excellent cycling stability, and rapid desalination rate. The desalination capacity is as high as 107.5 mg g-1 after 50 cycles with the current density of 100 mA g-1 .

Here, copper sulfide is suggested as a superior electrode material with high capacity, high rate, and long‐term cyclability owing to its unique conversion reaction mechanism that is pulverization‐tolerant and thus induces the capacity recovery. Such a desirable consequence comes from the combined effect among formation of stable grain boundaries, semi‐coherent boundaries, and solid‐electrolyte interphase layers.

The composition and evolution of the SEI in Na2Ti3O7 electrodes is hereby studied by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). To overcome typical XPS limitations in the photoelectron energy assignments, the analysis of the Auger parameter is here proposed for the first time in battery materials characterization. We have found that the electrode/electrolyte interface formed upon discharge, mostly composed by carbonates and semicarbonates (Na2CO3, NaCO3R), fluorides (NaF), chlorides (NaCl) and poly(ethylene oxide)s, is unstable upon electrochemical cycling. Additionally, solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies prove the reaction of the polyvinylidene difluoride (PVdF) binder with sodium. The powerful approach used in this work, namely Auger parameter study, enables us to correctly determine the composition of the electrode surface layer without any interference from surface charging or absolute binding energy calibration effects.

For sodium‐ion electrodes, however, an amorphous solid may be more advantageous as a result of the open framework to facilitate ion insertion and the ability to tolerate volumetric changes. Herein, it is shown that the Na+ insertion properties of amorphous VO2 (a‐VO2) are superior to those of crystalline VO2(B). Amorphous VO2 exhibits a linear voltage characteristic over a 3 V range (4.0 to 1.0 V vs Na/Na+) leading to a reversible capacity as high as 400 mAh g−1 and rapid redox kinetics, which is attributed to its pseudocapacitive nature. The linear voltage characteristic over 3 V affords the opportunity of fabricating a symmetric Na‐ion battery in which the a‐VO2 material serves as both the positive electrode and the negative electrode. Such a symmetric battery offers safer operation in terms of overcharging, overdischarging, polarity reversal, high charge/discharge current abuse, and long‐term usage.

A high reversible specific capacity of 116 mA h g-1 (nearly 99% of the theoretical specific capacities) can be obtained at the current density of 0.1 C. Even after a 300-fold current density increased (30 C), the discharge specific capacity of the flexible electrode still remains 63 mA h g-1 .

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are generally considered as promising cheap alternatives of lithium-ion batteries for stationary renewable energy storage and have received increasing attention in recent years. The exploration of anode materials with efficient electron transportation is essential for improving the performance of SIBs. Inspired by the signal transfer mode of a neuron, we designed a composite by stringing MoS2 nanoflower (soma) with multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) (axons). High-resolution TEM observation reveals a lattice matching growth mechanism of MoS2 nanosheets on the interface of MWCNTs and the lattice expansion of the (002) plane of MoS2. The lattice matching among the MoS2 nanosheet and MWCNT could facilitate electron transfer and structure maintenance upon cycling. The expanded distance of the (002) plane of MoS2 would also promote the sodium-ion intercalation/deintercalation kinetics of the composite. Benefiting from the structural features, when used as an anode material for SIBs, the composite exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, including high specific capacity, excellent cycle stability, and superior rate capabilities. A stable capacity of 527.7 mAh g-1 can be achieved after 110 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g-1. The neuron-inspired design proposed is a promising and efficient strategy for the development of electrode materials for SIBs with high mass transport kinetics and structural stability.",

        "abstract": "Titanium disulfide (TiS2) is investigated as an advanced conversion electrode for sodium (Na)‐ion batteries (NIB) in an ether‐based electrolyte (NaPF6/glyme (DME)). The as‐prepared TiS2 demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 1040 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 with the capacity contribution of 521 mA h g−1 in the voltage region below 1.0 V (vs Na/Na+), remarkable initial coulombic efficiency of 95.9% and superior rate capability of 621 mA h g−1 at 40 A g−1. The high conductivity of the Ti‐based compounds and nanosized particles generated by chemical conversion reactions could minimize the entropic barrier for the reversible conversion, resulting in high reversibility and ultrafast charge/discharge ability of the electrode. Moreover, with its strong ability to adsorb soluble polysulfide intermediates, the as‐prepared TiS2 electrode exhibits superior cycling stability over 9000 cycles, serving as a stable and ultra‐high capacity conversion electrode for NIBs.",

Here, an all‐stretchable‐component sodium‐ion full battery based on graphene‐modified poly(dimethylsiloxane) sponge electrodes and an elastic gel membrane is developed for the first time. The battery exhibits reasonable electrochemical performance and robust mechanical deformability; its electrochemical characteristics can be well‐maintained under many different stretched conditions and after hundreds of stretching–release cycles.

The structural and electrochemical performances of the electrode material were investigated to establish its applicability in sodium ion capacitors. The electrochemical performance was evaluated using metallic sodium in a half cell configuration which delivered a maximum specific capacitance of 226 F g−1 at 0.03 A g−1. When examined as a symmetric hybrid electrode (full cell) it delivered a maximum capacitance of 55 F g−1 at 0.03 A g−1.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries are now close to replacing lithium-ion batteries because they provide superior alternative energy storage solutions that are in great demand, particularly for large-scale applications. To that end, the present study is focused on the properties of a new type of dual-electrode material, Na0.5Ni0.25Mn0.75O2, synthesized using a mixed hydroxy-carbonate route. Cyclic voltammetry confirms that redox couples, at high and low voltage ranges, are facilitated by the unique features and properties of this dual-electrode, through sodium ion deintercalation/intercalation into the layered Na0.5Ni0.25Mn0.75O2 material. This material provides superior performance for Na-ion batteries, as evidenced by the fabricated sodium cell that yielded initial charge-discharge capacities of 125/218 mAh g-1 in the voltage range of 1.5-4.4 V at 0.5 C. At a low voltage range (1.5-2.6 V), the anode cell delivered discharge-charge capacities of 100/99 mAh g-1 with 99% capacity retention, which corresponds to highly reversible redox reaction of the Mn4+/3+ reduction and the Mn3+/4+ oxidation observed at 1.85 and 2.06 V, respectively. The symmetric Na-ion cell, fabricated using Na0.5Ni0.25Mn0.75O2, yielded initial charge-discharge capacities of 196/187 μAh at 107 μA.

In particular, iron carbodiimide, FeNCN, can be efficiently used as negative electrode material for alkali-metal-ion batteries, similar to its oxide analogue FeO. Based on (57)Fe Mössbauer and infrared spectroscopy (IR) data, the electrochemical reaction mechanism can be explained by the reversible transformation of the Fe-NCN into Li/Na-NCN bonds during discharge and charge. These new electrode materials exhibit higher capacity compared to well-established negative electrode references such as graphite or hard carbon. Contrary to its oxide analogue, iron carbodiimide does not require heavy treatments (such as nanoscale tailoring, sophisticated textures, or coating) to obtain long cycle life with current density as high as 9 A g(-1) for hundreds of charge-discharge cycles. Similar to the iron compound, several other transition-metal carbodiimides M(x)(NCN)y with M=Mn, Cr, Zn can cycle successfully versus lithium and sodium.

By suppressing structure defects, the cathode exhibits a high capacity of 123 mAh g-1 with initial Coulombic efficiency of 87.2%, a long cycling lifespan of 3000 cycles, and significantly enhanced high/low temperature performance and calendar life. Remarkably, the low structure distortion and high sodium diffusion coefficient have been identified via in situ synchrotron powder diffraction and first-principles calculations, while its thermal stability has been analyzed by in situ heated X-ray powder diffraction.

        "abstract": "Developing hard carbon with a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and very good cycling stability is of great importance for practical sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Defects and oxygen-containing groups grown along either the carbon edges or the layers, however, are inevitable in hard carbon and can cause a tremendous density of irreversible Na+ sites, decreasing the efficiency and therefore causing failure of the battery. Thus, eliminating these unexpected defect structures is significant for enhancing the battery performance. Herein, we develop a strategy of applying a soft-carbon coating onto free-standing hard-carbon electrodes, which greatly hinders the formation of defects and oxygen-containing groups on hard carbon. The electrochemical results show that the soft-carbon-coated, free-standing hard-carbon electrodes can achieve an ultrahigh ICE of 94.1% and long cycling performance (99% capacity retention after 100 cycles at a current density of 20 mA g-1), demonstrating their great potential in practical sodium storage systems. The sodium storage mechanism was also investigated by operando Raman spectroscopy. Our sodium storage mechanism extends the \"adsorption-intercalation-pore filling-deposition\" model. We propose that the pore filling in the plateau area might be divided into two parts: (1) sodium could fill in the pores near the inner wall of the carbon layer; (2) when the sodium in the inner wall pores is close to saturation, the sodium could be further deposited onto the existing sodium.",

In lithium cells, only the octahedral structure forms, but in sodium cells, trigonal prismatic structures are also possible. However, there is a lack of understanding about how to predict and control the formation of each structure. Zhao et al. used the simple properties of ions, namely their charge and their radius appropriately weighted by stoichiometry, to determine whether sodium in the interlayers between the transition metal or other ion-oxide layers remain octahedral rather than switching over to trigonal prismatic coordination. Science, this issue p. 708 The energy storage properties of layered oxides are characterized and optimized for cathodes in sodium ion batteries. Sodium-ion batteries have captured widespread attention for grid-scale energy storage owing to the natural abundance of sodium. The performance of such batteries is limited by available electrode materials, especially for sodium-ion layered oxides, motivating the exploration of high compositional diversity. How the composition determines the structural chemistry is decisive for the electrochemical performance but very challenging to predict, especially for complex compositions. We introduce the “cationic potential” that captures the key interactions of layered materials and makes it possible to predict the stacking structures. This is demonstrated through the rational design and preparation of layered electrode materials with improved performance. As the stacking structure determines the functional properties, this methodology offers a solution toward the design of alkali metal layered oxides.",

        "title": "Exceptional Sodium-Ion Storage by an Aza-Covalent Organic Framework for High Energy and Power Density Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Redox-active covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a new class of material with the potential to transform electrochemical energy storage due to the well-defined porosity and readily accessible redox-active sites of COFs. However, combining both high specific capacity and energy density in COF-based batteries remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we demonstrate the exceptional performance of Aza-COF in rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Aza-COF is a microporous 2D COF synthesized from hexaketocyclohexane and 1,2,4,5-benzenetetramine by a condensation reaction, which affords phenazine-decorated channels and a theoretical specific capacity of 603 mA h g-1. The Aza-COF-based electrode exhibits an exceptional average specific capacity (550 mA h g-1), energy density (492 W h kg-1) at 0.1 C, and power density (1182 W kg-1) at 40 C. The high capacity and energy density are attributed to swift surface-controlled redox processes and rapid sodium-ion diffusion inside the porous electrode. Rate capability studies showed that the battery also performs well at high current rates: 1 C (363 mA h g-1), 5 C (232 mA h g-1), 10 C (161 mA h g-1), and 20 C (103 mA h g-1). In addition, the long-term cycling stability test revealed very good capacity retention (87% at 5 C) and Coulombic efficiencies near unity over 500 cycles.",

        "abstract": "ZnSe is regarded as a promising anode material for energy storage due to its high theoretical capacity and environment friendliness. Nevertheless, it is still a significant challenge to obtain superior electrode materials with stable performance owing to the serious volume change and aggregation upon cycling. Herein, a willow-leaf-like nitrogen-doped carbon-coated ZnSe (ZnSe@NC) composite synthesized through facile solvothermal and subsequent selenization process is beneficial to expose more active sites and facilitate the fast electron/ion transmission. These merits significantly enhance the electrochemical performances of ZnSe@NC for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs). The obtained ZnSe@NC exhibits outstanding rate performance (440.3 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and 144.4 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 ) and ultralong cycle stability (242.2 mAh g-1 at 8.0 A g-1 even after 3200 cycles) for SIBs. It is noted that 106.5 mAh g-1 can be retained after 550 cycles and 71.4 mAh g-1 is still remained after 1500 cycles at 200 mA g-1 when applied as anode for PIBs, indicating good cycle stability of the electrode. The possible electrochemical mechanism and the ionic diffusion kinetics of the ZnSe@NC are investigated using ex situ X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and a series of electrochemical analyses.",

        "abstract": "To attain both high energy density and power density in sodium‐ion (Na+) batteries, the reaction kinetics and structural stability of anodes should be improved by materials optimization. In this work, few‐layered molybdenum sulfide selenide (MoSSe) consisting of a mixture of 1T and 2H phases is designed to provide high ionic/electrical conductivities, low Na+ diffusion barrier, and stable Na+ storage. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is used as a conductive matrix to form 3D electron transfer paths. The resulting MoSSe@rGO anode exhibits high capacity and rate performance in both organic and solid‐state electrolytes. The ultrafast Na+ storage kinetics of the MoSSe@rGO anode is attributed to the surface‐dominant reaction process and broad Na+ channels. In situ and ex situ measurements are conducted to reveal the Na+ storage process in MoSSe@rGO. It is found that the MoS and MoSe bonds effectively limit the dissolution of the active materials. The favorable Na+ storage kinetics of the MoSSe@rGO electrode are ascribed to its low adsorption energy of −1.997 eV and low diffusion barrier of 0.087 eV. These results reveal that anion doping of metal sulfides is a feasible strategy to develop sodium‐ion batteries with high energy and power densities and long life‐span.",

The formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in SIBs is still challenging due to the higher solubility of the SEI components compared to lithium analogues. This study therefore aims to shed light on the dissolution of SEI influenced by the electrolyte chemistry. By conducting electrochemical tests with extended open circuit pauses, and using surface spectroscopy, we determine the extent of self‐discharge due to SEI dissolution. Instead of using a conventional separator, β‐alumina was used as sodium‐conductive membrane to avoid crosstalk between the working and sodium‐metal counter electrode. The relative capacity loss after a pause of 50 hours in the tested electrolyte systems ranges up to 30 %. The solubility of typical inorganic SEI species like NaF and Na2CO3 was determined. The electrolytes were then saturated by those SEI species in order to oppose ageing due to the dissolution of the SEI.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered a prospective candidate for large-scale energy storage due to the merits of abundant sodium resources and low cost. However, a lack of suitable advanced anode materials has hindered further applications. Herein, metal-semiconductor mixed phase twinned hierarchical (MPTH) MoS2 nanowires with an expanded interlayer (9.63 Å) are engineered and prepared using MoO3 nanobelts as a self-sacrificed template in the presence of a trace amount of (NH4 )6 Mo7 O24 ·4H2 O as initiator. The greatly expanded interlayer spacing accelerates Na+ insertion/extraction kinetics, and the metal-semiconductor mixed phase enhances electron transfer ability and stabilizes electrode structure during cycling. Benefiting from the structural merits, the MPTH MoS2 electrode delivers high reversible capacities of 200 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 for 200 cycles and 154 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 for 2450 cycles in the voltage range of 0.4-3.0 V. Strikingly, the electrode maintains 6500 cycles at a current density of 2 A g-1 , corresponding to a capacity retention of 82.8% of the 2nd cycle, overwhelming the all reported MoS2 cycling results. This study provides an alternative strategy to boost SIB cycling performance in terms of reversible capacity by virtue of interlayer expansion and structure stability.",

Cobalt species in the pristine MOF catalyze the graphitization around organic components in calcination, generating a highly conductive network in which the bismuth is to be embedded.

Herein, MoS2 is converted to a ternary MoS2- xSe x alloy through the selenizing process in order to boost the electrochemical performance for Na-ion batteries. Conversion of MoS2 to MoS2- xSe x expands interlayer spacing, improves electronic conductivity, and creates more defects. The expanded interlayer spacing decreases Na+ diffusion resistance and facilitates Na+ fast transfer. The integrated graphene as a conductive network offers effective pathway for electron migration and maintains structural stability of electrodes during cycles. The ternary MoS1.2Se0.8/graphene (MoS1.2Se0.8/G) electrode demonstrates an extremely high reversible capacity of 509 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 (capacity retention of 109%) as an anode for sodium-ion batteries. Even at 2 A g-1 and after 700 cycles, the MoS1.2Se0.8/G electrode also displays a relatively high reversible capacity of 178 mA h g-1. Full cells assembled with Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathodes and MoS1.2Se0.8/G anodes reveal high charge/discharge capacities.

However, its charge storage mechanism is unclear, hindering further improvement of the cell performance.

To address this problem, ultrathin few‐layer bismuthene with a large aspect ratio is rationally synthesized, and can relieve the expansion strain along the z‐axis. A free‐standing bismuthene/graphene composite electrode with tunable thickness achieves a strikingly stable and high areal sodium storage capacity of 12.1 mAh cm−2, which greatly exceeds that of most reported electrode materials.

The thermodynamic and kinetic stability of monolayer MBenes at room temperature was confirmed by AIMD simulations and phonon spectra. We investigated the potential of two-dimensional MBenes (V, Cr, Mn) as lithium/sodium ion anode electrode materials. Research shows that MBenes have inherent metallic properties, and their mechanical properties indicate that MBenes have high Young's modulus and anisotropy, low diffusion potential and low open-circuit voltage, with outstanding rate performance and good chemical stability in practical applications. In addition, functionalization tends to strongly reduce electrochemical performance and should be avoided as much as possible in experiments. These interesting findings fully demonstrate that the predicted monolayer MBenes are attractive anode materials for lithium/sodium ion batteries.",

To probe the electrochemical properties of NIBs, sodium metal is most frequently applied as the reference and/or counter electrode in state‐of‐the‐art literature. However, the high reactivity of the sodium metal and its impact on the electrochemical performance is usually neglected. In this study, it is shown that spontaneous reactions of sodium metal with organic electrolytes and the importance of critical interpretation of electrochemical experiments is emphasized. When using sodium‐metal half‐cells, decomposition products contaminate the electrolyte during the electrochemical measurement and can easily lead to wrong conclusions about the stability of the active materials. The cycling stability is highly affected by these electrolyte contaminations, which is proven by comparing sodium‐metal‐free cell with sodium‐metal‐containing cells. Interestingly, a more stable cycling performance of the Li4Ti5O12 half‐cells can be observed when replacing the Na metal counter and reference electrodes with activated carbon electrodes. This difference is attributed to the altered properties of the electrolyte as a result of contamination and to different surface chemistries.",

However, the lack of high-performance electrode materials has been the major challenge of sodium-based energy storage devices.

Coupling with a carbon-based cathode, a full cell of sodium-ion capacitor successfully demonstrates a high energy density of 64.2 Wh kg-1 at 56.3 W kg-1 and 25.8 Wh kg-1 at 1357 W kg-1, as well as an ultralong lifespan of 10 000 cycles with over 90% of capacity retention.",

        "abstract": "To achieve the high‐power sodium‐ion batteries, the solid‐state ion diffusion in the electrode materials is a highly concerned issue and needs to be solved. In this study, a simple and effective strategy is reported to weaken and degrade this process by engineering the intensified surface and near‐surface reactions, which is realized by making use of a sandwich‐type nanoarchitecture composed of graphene as electron channels and few‐layered MoS2 with expanded interlayer spacing. The unique 2D sheet‐shaped hierarchical structure is capable of shortening the ion diffusion length, while the few‐layered MoS2 with expanded interlayer spacing has more accessible surface area and the decreased ion diffusion resistance, evidenced by the smaller energy barriers revealed by the density functional theory calculations. Benefiting from the shortened ion diffusion distance and enhanced electron transfer capability, a high ratio of surface or near‐surface reactions is dominated at a high discharge/charge rate. As such, the composites exhibit the high capacities of 152 and 93 mA h g−1 at 30 and 50 A g−1, respectively. Moreover, a high reversible capacity of 684 mA h g−1 and an excellent cycling stability up to 4500 cycles can be delivered. The outstanding performance is attributed to the engineered structure with increased contribution of surface or near‐surface reactions.",

Very few candidates available at present can simultaneously meet the requirements on capacity, rate capability, and cycle life. Herein, we report a high-temperature solution method to prepare Ni3S4 nanorods with uniform sizes. These colloidal nanorods readily self-assemble side by side and form microsized superstructures, which unfortunately negates the nanoscale feature of individual nanorods. To this end, we further introduce two-dimensional graphene nanosheets as the spacer to interrupt nanorod self-assembly. Resultant composite presents a marked advantage toward electrochemical storage of Na+ ions. We demonstrate that in half-cells it exhibits large reversible specific capacity in excess of 600 mAh/g, high rate capability with >300 mAh/g retained at 4 A/g, and great cycle life at different current rates. This anode material can also be combined with the NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode in full cells to enable large capacity and good cyclability.",

We summarize first-principles efforts to elucidate the behaviour of such compounds in the layered and spinel structures. Trends based on the size and valence of the intercalant and the ionicity of the host are sufficient to explain phase stability and ordering phenomena, which in turn determine the equilibrium voltage profile. For the layered structures, we provide an overarching view of intercalant orderings in prismatic coordination based on antiphase boundaries, which has important consequences for diffusion. We examine details of stacking sequence transitions between different layered structures by calculating stacking fault energies and discussing the nature of dislocations. A better understanding of these transitions will likely aid the development of batteries with improved cyclability.

        "abstract": "Carbon‐based materials have been considered as the most promising anode materials for both sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium‐ion batteries (PIBs), owing to their good chemical stability, high electrical conductivity, and environmental benignity. However, due to the large sizes of sodium and potassium ions, it is a great challenge to realize a carbon anode with high reversible capacity, long cycle life, and high rate capability. Herein, by rational design, N‐doped 3D mesoporous carbon nanosheets (N‐CNS) are successfully synthesized, which can realize unprecedented electrochemical performance for both SIBs and PIBs. The N‐CNS possess an ultrathin nanosheet structure with hierarchical pores, ultrahigh level of pyridinic N/pyrrolic N, and an expanded interlayer distance. The beneficial features that can enhance the Na‐/K‐ion intercalation/deintercalation kinetic process, shorten the diffusion length for both ions and electrons, and accommodate the volume change are demonstrated. Hence, the N‐CNS‐based electrode delivers a high capacity of 239 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1 after 10 000 cycles for SIBs and 321 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1 after 5000 cycles for PIBs.

        "abstract": "The increasing need for energy, the widespread adoption of electric vehicles and renewable energy storage systems, and the search for cost-effective, reliable energy storage options are all factors in the dynamic nature of the global energy landscape and energy storage industry. As more and more people switch to using electric vehicles and other kinds of renewable energy storage, there has been a corresponding increase in demand for LIBs all around the globe. Despite increasing demand, there are geopolitical and supply-chain risks as most LIBs are still manufactured in only a few countries, namely China, Japan, and South Korea. Sodium-ion batteries, also known as SIBs, have recently come to the forefront as a potentially advantageous candidate for the large-scale storage of electric energy due to the potential advantages of widespread availability and low cost of sodium resources. SIB research and development are still at an early stage, and there are few opportunities for their commercialization. SIBs do, however, confront a number of issues that need to be addressed, including as their short cycle life and rate capability, the restricted availability of high-performance materials, and the need for more research and development to maximize their performance and dependability. Nonetheless, tremendous progress has been made recently, and several businesses and research centers across the globe are attempting to enhance SIB technology. The high theoretical specific capacity and quantity of component elements make layered metal oxides suitable cathode materials for SIBs. In order to enhance their electrochemical performance, however, further exploration is required to deal with their drawbacks, such as limited rate capability and voltage fading. As the cathode materials play such a large role in determining the energy density of SIBs, the primary issue in developing high-energy SIBs is discovering cathode materials with plentiful active sites, high reaction potential, unhindered ionic channels, and stable structures. Tailoring the morphology of materials using nanostructure engineering opens up hitherto unimagined possibilities for exploiting the functional features such as enhanced electrode's specific surface area, decreased sodium-ion diffusion distance, and boost in electronic conductivity. This study demonstrates a quaternary 1D layered transition metal oxide-based cathode with a composition of Na0.67Fe0.25Mn0.5Ti0.2V0.05O2 synthesized by a facile sol-gel strategy. From the SEM results, it is seen that 1D spoke like nanorods are evolved with a tiny fraction of 3D hexagonal lattice which is due to the excessive presence of vanadium in the stoichiometry ratio of the composite. Such nanorod framework configuration facilitates large surface area in contact with the electrolyte that is suitable for charge migration and rapid diffusion of sodium ions through short solid-state route. The P2- Na0.67Fe0.25Mn0.5Ti0.2V0.05O2 microstructure, with its high crystallinity and nanorod structure, showed off a high specific capacity and outstanding rate capability which is visible through electrochemical analysis results.\n",

Ex situ X-ray diffraction combined with diffusion kinetics tests and microstructural characterizations demonstrate that high-entropy enhanced structural stability effectively prevents the Jahn-Teller distortion of Mn3+, stabilizes the Na+ diffusion channels, and enables the smooth transfer of more working Na+. These lead to a stable and fast redox electrochemistry in high-entropy Mn-Fe-HEO.

Furthermore, excellent low‐temperature adaptability (82 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1, 60 mA h g−1 at 400 mA g−1, and 90.4% capacity retention after 230 cycles at 100 mA g−1) at −40 °C is also achieved. This unique work has broken a feasible pathway for high‐performance SIB cathode at low temperature.",

        "abstract": "Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) used as sodium ion battery (SIB) cathodes are usually the focus of attention due to their three-dimensional open frame and high theoretical capacity. Nonetheless, the disadvantages of a low working voltage and inferior structural stability of PBAs prevent their further applications. Herein, we propose constructing the Kx(MnFeCoNiCu)[Fe(CN)6] (HE-K-PBA) cathode by high-entropy and potassium incorporation strategy to simultaneously realize high working voltage and cycling stability. The reaction mechanism of metal cations in HE-K-PBA are revealed by synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and in situ Raman spectra. We also investigate the entropy stabilization mechanism via finite element simulation, demonstrating that HE-K-PBA with small von Mises stress and weak structure strain can significantly mitigate the structural distortion. Benefit from the stable structure and everlasting K+ (de)intercalation, the HE-K-PBA delivers high output voltage (3.46 V), good reversible capacity (120.5 mAh g-1 at 0.01 A g-1), and capacity retention of 90.4% after 1700 cycles at 1.0 A g-1. Moreover, the assembled full cell and all-solid-state batteries with a stable median voltage of 3.29 V over 3000 cycles further demonstrate the application prospects of the HE-K-PBA cathode.",

        "abstract": "Layered oxide cathodes of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered promising candidates due to their fascinating high capacity, good cyclability, and environmental friendliness. However, the air sensitivity of layered SIB cathodes causes high electrode manufacturing costs and performance deterioration, hampering their practical application. Herein, a commercial O3-type layered Na(Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3)O2 (NNFM) material is adopted to investigate the air corrosive problem and the suppression strategy. We reveal that once the layered material comes in contact with ambient air, cations migrate from transition metal (TM) layers to sodium layers at the near surface, although Na+ and TM ions show quite different ion radii. Experimental results and theoretical calculations show that more Ni/Na disorder occurs in the air-exposed O3-NNFM materials, owing to a lower Ni migration energy barrier. The cation mixing results in detrimental structural distortion, along with the formation of residual alkali species on the surface, leading to high impedance for Na+ diffusion during charge/discharge. To tackle this problem, an ultrathin and uniform hydrophobic molecular layer of perfluorodecyl trimethoxysilane is assembled on the O3-NNFM surface, which significantly suppresses unfavorable chemistry and structure degradation during air storage. The in-depth understanding of the structural degradation mechanism and suppression strategy presented in this work can facilitate high-energy cathode manufacturing from the perspective of future practical implementation and commercialization.",

        "abstract": "High-entropy materials (HEMs) have been explored as high-capacity cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their excellent structural stability and abundant metal redox sites. Among them, high-entropy sulfides (HESs) have greater potential and more extensive research than high-entropy oxides, as they exhibit higher charging voltage and theoretical capacity as cathodes. Furthermore, alkali metal doping of HESs can further enhance their performance and broaden their application fields. Inspired by the cocktail effect of HEMs, we performed the first theoretical calculation of the properties of Na(MnFeCoNi)1/2S and its Li-doped derivative, Na7/8Li1/8(MnFeCoNi)1/2S, to understand their potential as SIB cathode materials. Using density functional theory based on first principles, we investigated the structure and electronic characteristics of Na(MnFeCoNi)1/2S and Na7/8Li1/8(MnFeCoNi)1/2S, and calculated their theoretical voltage and capacity, respectively. Compared with Na(MnFeCoNi)1/2S, Na7/8Li1/8(MnFeCoNi)1/2S showed better electronic performance in reducing the band gap and increasing the density of states, ultimately providing a specific capacity of 160.3 mAh·g-1 and a charging voltage of 4.85 V in sodium-ion storage. Moreover, Na7/8Li1/8(MnFeCoNi)1/2S exhibited remarkable structural stability throughout the sodium-ion deintercalation process, thus it can be reasonably concluded that Na7/8Li1/8(MnFeCoNi)1/2S can serve as an excellent cathode material for future SIB applications.",

However, on the other hand, the conductivity as well as the available capacity of the polyanion compounds are still poor, which limits their applications; moreover, some polyanion cathode operate at low voltage, which reduces the energy density and raises the cost of the battery system. We here try to summarize the recent progress of polyanion compounds as cathode materials for SIB. These compounds are categorized based on the metal redox couple, including V‐, Cr‐, Mn‐, Fe‐, Co‐, and Ni‐polyanion compounds.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion battery (SIB) is a candidate for the stationary energy storage systems because of the low cost and high abundance of sodium. However, the energy density and lifespan of SIBs suffer severely from the irreversible consumption of the Na-ions for the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and other side reactions on the electrodes. Here, Na3.5C6O6 is proposed as an air-stable high-efficiency sacrificial additive in the cathode to compensate for the lost sodium. It is characteristic of low desodiation (oxidation) potential (3.4-3.6 V vs. Na+/Na) and high irreversible desodiation capacity (theoretically 378 mAh g-1). The feasibility of using Na3.5C6O6 as a sodium compensation additive is verified with the improved electrochemical performances of a Na2/3Ni1/3Mn1/3Ti1/3O2ǀǀhard carbon cells and cells using other cathode materials. In addition, the structure of Na3.5C6O6 and its desodiation path are also clarified on the basis of comprehensive physical characterizations and the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This additive decomposes completely to supply abundant Na ions during the initial charge without leaving any electrochemically inert species in the cathode. Its decomposition product C6O6 enters the carbonate electrolyte without bringing any detectable negative effects. These findings open a new avenue for elevating the energy density and/or prolonging the lifetime of the high-energy-density secondary batteries.",

XRD and Rietveld refinement reveal expanded lattice parameters for NAVPF compared to the undoped sample, and the successful cation doping into the Na superionic conductor (NASICON) framework improves Na+ diffusion channels. The NAVPF delivers an ultrahigh capacity of 148 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 with 90.8% retention after 200 cycles, enabled by the activation of V2+ /V5+ multielectron reaction.

In situ XRD demonstrates solid-solution reactions occurred during charge-discharge of NAVPF without two-phase reactions, indicating enhanced structural stability after F-doped. The full cell with NAVPF cathode and Na+ preintercalated hard carbon anode shows a large discharge capacity of 100 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 with 80.2% retention after 100 cycles.

SIB with polyanionic compound cathodes have the advantages of good stability, cycle performance and safety, but its specific capacity is low and its conductivity is poor. Layered oxide materials have the advantage of high specific capacity and high compatibility with lithium battery ternary cathode process equipment. It is also the fastest technical route for industrialization at present. However, due to the deintercalation process of sodium ions, the layered metal oxide is prone to structural changes or phase transformations, resulting in the degradation of battery cycle performance. Prussian blue cathode materials are easy to synthesize, Na+ migrates quickly, and the battery capacity is large, but its battery capacity is prone to rapid decline.

Herein, the key role of electronegativity‐difference configuration on the activation of OAR is find out, and further tune electronegativity‐difference configuration with La incorporation to construct non‐bonded O 2p orbitals and achieve the reversible anionic redox in O3‐type NaMn1/3Fe1/3Ni1/3O2. Owing to the special extranuclear electronic structure of La3+ [Xe], the La electron cloud is difficult to be disturbed by the O electron cloud, and some O electrons do not participate in the formation of ionic bonds, thus retaining the non‐bonded electrons of O 2p and activating OAR. Moreover, La3+ doping also decreases the Coulomb force between Na+ and O2− favoring Na+ migration as well as strengthening the La─O bonds inhibiting the irreversible phase transition. La2O3 coating layer also plays a role on inhibiting the reaction between molecular oxygen and the electrolyte, and making OAR reversible. After modification, the cycling stability is significantly improved (86.9% vs 27.3%@2C@200cycles; 90.8% vs 52.9%@5C@300 cycles).

With high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, we identify surface densification, resulting in 5 − 10 nm thick surface layers on cycled cathode active materials as the origin for SOC-independent increase of polarization. The corresponding oxygen loss is in accordance with gas evolution in differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) measurements. Furthermore, with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) electrode cross sections, we identify (partly) reversible cracking at a high SOC as the cause for increased polarization depending on SOC. Operando X-ray diffraction (XRD) identifies significant anisotropic volume change, which suggests mechanical stress as the cause for cracking at a high SOC and loss of active material after prolonged cycling.

For the expected sodium vanadium bronzes (NaxV2O5) precipitation, the preparation of xNV was performed by keeping the system in the molten state at 1200 °C for one hour, followed by a temperature decrease in the electric furnace to room temperature at a cooling rate of 10 °C min−1. XRD patterns of the 15NV ceramic exhibited the formation of Na0.33V2O5 and NaV3O8 crystalline phases. Moreover, the V K-edge XANES showed that the absorption edge energy of ceramics 15NV recorded at 5479 eV is smaller than that of V2O5 at 5481 eV, evidently indicating a partial reduction from V5+ to V4+ due to the precipitation of Na0.33V2O5. In the cyclic voltammetry, reduction peaks of 15NV were observed at 1.12, 1.78 V, and 2.69 V, while the oxidation peak showed up only at 2.36 V. The values of the reduction peaks were related to the NaV3O8 crystalline phase. Moreover, the diffusion coefficient of Na+ (DNa+) gradually decreased from 8.28 × 10−11 cm2 s−1 to 1.23 × 10−12 cm2 s−1 with increasing Na2O content (x) from 5 to 45 mol%. In the evaluation of the active cathode performance of xNV in SIB, ceramics 15NV showed the highest discharge capacity 203 mAh g−1 at a current rate of 50 mA g−1. In the wider voltage range from 0.8 to 3.6 V, the capacity retention was maintained at 50% after 30 cycles, while it was significantly improved to 90% in the narrower voltage range from 1.8 to 4.0 V, although the initial capacity decreased to 56 mAh g−1. It is concluded that the precipitation of the Na0.33V2O5 phase improved the structural and electrical properties of 15NV, which provides a high capacity for the Na-ion battery when incorporated as a cathode active material.",

        "title": "High-Performance Zr-Doped P3-Type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 Cathode for Na-Ion Battery Applications",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion battery (SIB) technology started to bloom along with lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) as a supportive energy source to alleviate the cost of lithium sources for the development of energy storage devices and electric vehicles. Layered cathode materials are considered potential candidates to produce high-energy-density batteries. Among the layered cathode materials, P3-type cathodes are the least investigated in spite of their capacities, which are comparable to those of P2-type cathodes. P3-type cathodes show high polarization, leading to a poor cycle life, which impedes their extensive use in practical applications. In this work, we report on zirconium doping as an effective strategy to improve cycling stability and reduce voltage fading, another serious issue of layered cathode materials. It is found that an optimum composition of the P3-type cathode with Zr doping at the Mn site, leading to a composition of Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.64Zr0.033O2, shows good electrochemical performance in terms of retention (89% after 100 cycles) when compared to Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.60Zr0.067O2 (85% after 100 cycles) and an undoped sample (83% after 100 cycles). Also, remarkable performance is delivered by the Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.64Zr0.033O2 sample, with a retention rate of 72% after 450 cycles. This result is also supported by an analysis of the amount of polarization for undoped and doped samples, which found that doping helps in improving the diffusion of ions, and the least polarization is obtained for the Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.64Zr0.033O2 sample.",

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPOF) is attracting great interest due to its large capacity and high working voltage. However, the poor electronic conductivity limits the electrochemical performance of NVPOF. Herein, we fabricate N/P-dual-doped carbon coated NVPOF microspheres (labeled as NVPOF@P/N/C) via a hydrothermal process followed by heat treatment. This microsphere-structured NVPOF@P/N/C composite has a relatively high tap density of 1.22 g cm-3. TEM and XPS results reveal that the dual-doped carbon layer is tightly coated on the NVPOF surface due to the bridging effect of P and has a good protective effect on NVPOF. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that N/P-dual-doped carbon layer is advantageous to achieve higher electronic conductivity and lower migration activation energy than the undoped and single N- or P-doped carbon layer. As cathode material for sodium-ion battery (SIB), the NVPOF@P/N/C exhibits high capacity (128 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C and 122 mAh g-1 at 2 C) and ultra-long cycle performance (only 0.037% capacity fading rate per cycle in 500 cycles at 2 C). We believe that the NVPOF@P/N/C composite is appealing for high-performance SIBs with large energy density.",

        "abstract": "Manganese-based spinel cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are promising candidates for next-generation batteries. Unfortunately, most SIB cathode materials exhibit inferior electrochemical properties and are less understood owing to their lower performance. Na[Ni0.5Mn1.5]O4 (NNMO) should be a promising candidate because of its high operating voltage and firm octahedral host structure. Compared with Li[Ni0.5Mn1.5]O4, first-principle calculations are conducted to elucidate the reasons for the low performance of NNMO and determine the requirements for realizing high-performance cathode materials for SIBs. Owing to the Ni2+/Ni4+ double redox, NNMO could operate at a high voltage; however, the large Na+ increases the local site energy of the redox center, promoting electron extraction from the redox center, leading to unexpected voltage loss. Additionally, the homogeneous free energy confirms that NNMO would undergo phase separation into fully intercalated and deintercalated phases, inducing lattice misfits along the interfaces of the two phases. Particularly, higher phase transition barrier and large Na+ cause fast phase separation, inducing increased polarization and severe stress field upon cycling. Strategies to improve manganese-based spinel cathode materials of SIBs, especially NNMO, must be differentiated by considering the effects of thermodynamic stability, structural evolution, and electronic structure on the electrochemical and cycle performance of cathode materials.",

        "title": "Facilitating Phase Evolution for a High-Energy-Efficiency, Low-Cost O3-Type NaxCu0.18Fe0.3Mn0.52O2 Sodium Ion Battery Cathode.",
        "abstract": "The phase transition and lattice parameter evolution of O3 structure commonly occurs in O3-type sodium ion battery (SIB) cathodes, which might enlarge the voltage hysteresis and lower the energy efficiency. Given that the cost is one of the issues discouraging the application of SIBs in large-scale energy storage, here we focus on Co/Ni-free NaxCu0.18Fe0.3Mn0.52O2 (x = 0.8, 0.85, 0.9) and propose a convenient strategy to reduce the voltage hysteresis. It is found that when the Na content is 0.8, the highest energy efficiency of 95.4% after activation is achieved (2.5-4.0 V, 50 mA g-1, the 50th cycle), in addition to a satisfactory capacity retention (about 0.056% decay per cycle). The further characterizations reveal that Na0.8Cu0.18Fe0.3Mn0.52O2 owns a gentle O3-P3 phase transition process and does not undergo O3 phase lattice parameter evolution. The key point lies in the attainability of the O3/P3 composite of the material. This work will provide a simple strategy for the rational design of O3-type cathodes with a high energy efficiency and might offer inspiration to search for layered oxides with a higher O3/P3 critical Na content through element adjustments.",

Now, this work provides high-voltage α-Fe2O3 nanoceramics cathodes fabricated by the solvothermal and calcination processes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Then, their structure and electrical conductivity were investigated by the first-principles calculations. Also, the SIB with the α-Fe2O3 nanoceramics cathode exhibits a high initial charge-specific capacity of 692.5 mA h g–1 from 2.0 to 4.5 V at a current density of 25 mA g–1. After 800 cycles, the discharge capacity is still 201.8 mA h g–1, well exceeding the one associated with the present-state high-voltage SIB. Furthermore, the effect of the porous structure of the α-Fe2O3 nanoceramics on sodium ion transport and cyclability is investigated. This reveals that α-Fe2O3 nanoceramics will be a remarkably promising low-cost and pollution-free high-voltage cathode candidate for high-voltage SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Polymer cathode materials are promising alternatives to inorganic counterparts for both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high theoretical capacity, adjustable molecular structure, and strong adaptability to different counterions in batteries, etc. However, they suffer from poor practical capacity and low rate capability because of their intrinsically poor conductivity. Herein, we report the synthesis of self-assembled graphene/poly(anthraquinonyl sufide) (PAQS) composite aerogel (GPA) with efficient integration of a three-dimensional (3D) graphene framework with electroactive PAQS particles via a novel dispersion-assembly strategy which can be used as a free-standing flexible cathode upon mechanical pressing. The entire GPA cathode can deliver the highest capacity of 156 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C (1 C = 225 mAh g-1) with an ultrahigh utilization (94.9%) of PAQS and exhibits an excellent rate performance with 102 mAh g-1 at 20 C in LIBs. Furthermore, the flexible GPA film was also tested as cathode for SIBs and demonstrated a high-rate capability with 72 mAh g-1 at 5 C and an ultralong cycling stability (71.4% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 0.5 C) which has rarely been achieved before. Such excellent electrochemical performance of GPA as cathode for both LIBs and SIBs could be ascribed to the fast redox kinetics and electron transportation within GPA, resulting from the interconnected conductive framework of graphene and the intimate interaction between graphene and PAQS through an efficient wrapping structure. This approach opens a universal way to develop cathode materials for powerful batteries with different metal-based counter electrodes.",

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have many advantages such as the low price and abundance of sodium raw materials that are suitable for large-scale energy storage applications. Herein, we report an Mn-based pyrophosphate, Na(2)MnP(2)O(7), as a new SIB cathode material. Unlike most Mn-based cathode materials, which suffer severely from sluggish kinetics, Na(2)MnP(2)O(7) exhibits good electrochemical activity at ~3.8 V vs Na/Na(+) with a reversible capacity of 90 mAh g(-1) at room temperature. It also shows an excellent cycling and rate performance: 96% capacity retention after 30 cycles and 70% capacity retention at a c-rate increase from 0.05C to 1C. These electrochemical activities of the Mn-containing cathode material even at room temperature with relatively large particle sizes are remarkable considering an almost complete inactivity of the Li counterpart, Li(2)MnP(2)O(7). Using first-principles calculations, we find that the significantly enhanced kinetics of Na(2)MnP(2)O(7) is mainly due to the locally flexible accommodation of Jahn-Teller distortions aided by the corner-sharing crystal structure in triclinic Na(2)MnP(2)O(7). By contrast, in monoclinic Li(2)MnP(2)O(7), the edge-sharing geometry causes multiple bonds to be broken and formed during charging reaction with a large degree of atomic rearrangements. We expect that the similar computational strategy to analyze the atomic rearrangements can be used to predict the kinetics behavior when exploring new cathode candidates.",

The complicated and ambiguous interior mechanism of microscopic interfacial chemistry has prevented reaching a consensus regarding the most suitable sodium salt for high-performance SIB electrolytes. Herein, we reveal that the solvation structure induced by different sodium salt anions determines the Na+ desolvation kinetics and interfacial film evolution process. Specifically, the weak interaction between Na+ and PF6- promoted sodium desolvation and storage kinetics. The solvation structure involving PF6- induced the anion's preferential decomposition, generating a thin, inorganic compound-rich cathode-electrolyte interphase that ensured interface stability and inhibited solvent decomposition, thereby guaranteeing electrode stability and promoting the charge transfer kinetics. This study provides clear evidence that NaPF6 is not only more compatible with industrial processes but also more conducive to battery performance. Commercial electrolyte design employing NaPF6 will undoubtedly promote the industrialization of SIBs.",

        "abstract": "While development of a sodium-ion battery (SIB) cathode has been approached by various routes, research on compatible anodes for advanced SIB systems has not been sufficiently addressed. The anode materials based on titanium oxide typically show low electrical performances in SIB systems primarily due to their low electrical/ionic conductivity. Thus, in this work, layered titanium oxides were hybridized with covalent organic nanosheets (CONs), which exhibited excellent electrical conductivity, to be used as anodes in SIBs. Moreover, to enlarge the accessible areas for sodium ions, the morphology of the hybrid was formulated in the form of a hollow sphere (HS), leading to the highly enhanced ionic conductivity. This synthesis method was based on the expectation of synergetic effects since titanium oxide provides direct electrostatic sodiation sites that shield organic components and CON supports high electrical and ionic conductivity with polarizable sodiation sites. Therefore, the hybrid shows enhanced and stable electrochemical performances as an anode for up to 2600 charge/discharge cycles compared to the HS without CONs. Furthermore, the best reversible capacities obtained from the hybrid were 426.2 and 108.5 mAh/g at current densities of 100 and 6000 mA/g, which are noteworthy results for the TiO2-based material.",

        "abstract": "Vanadium-based phosphates are being extensively studied as an important family of sodium-ion battery (SIB) cathodes. Among many compositions, NaVOPO4 is considered because of various polymorphs and the high redox potential of V4+/5+. However, due to relatively poor intrinsic kinetics and electronic conductivity, approaches such as nanostructuring and carbon composites are commonly used to avoid fast performance degradation. Being different from mainstream approaches, this work utilizes the knowledge gained from potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) and applies layered KVOPO4, a PIB cathode material, as a SIB cathode material. The results demonstrate that KVOPO4 experiences an electrochemical K+-Na+ exchange during the initial cycle and a Na-dominated (de)intercalation process in the following cycles. The initial exchange results in a small amount of K+ (∼0.1 K per formula) remaining in the interlayer space and owing to the larger size of K+ than Na+, the residual K+ effectively acts as ‘pillars’ to expand interlayer spacing and facilitates the Na (de)intercalation, leading to enhanced reversible Na storage and diffusion kinetics of KVOPO4 compared to its Na counterpart NaVOPO4. KVOPO4 delivers an initial discharge capacity of 120 mAh g−1 (90% of the theoretical capacity) at 10 mA g−1 and retains 88% capacity after 150 cycles. It also delivers 52 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 91% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 100 mA g−1, completely outperforming NaVOPO4.",

        "title": "Electrolyte Engineering with Tamed Electrode Interphases for High‐Voltage Sodium‐Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) hold great promise for next‐generation grid‐scale energy storage. However, the highly instable electrolyte/electrode interphases threaten the long‐term cycling of high‐energy SIBs. In particular, the instable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) at high voltage causes persistent electrolyte decomposition, transition metal dissolution, and fast capacity fade. Here, this work proposes a balanced principle for the molecular design of SIB electrolytes that enables an ultra‐thin, homogeneous, and robust CEI layer by coupling an intrinsically oxidation‐stable succinonitrile solvent with moderately solvating carbonates. The proposed electrolyte not only shows limited anodic decomposition thus leading to a thin CEI, but also suppresses dissolution of CEI components at high voltage. Consequently, the tamed electrolyte/electrode interphases enable extremely stable cycling of Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) cathodes with outstanding capacity retention (>90%) over 3000 cycles (8 months) at 1 C with a high charging voltage of 4.3 V. Further, the NVOPF||hard carbon full cell shows stable cycling over 500 cycles at 1 C with a high average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.6%. The electrolyte also endows high‐voltage operation of SIBs with great temperature adaptability from −25 to 60 °C, shedding light on the essence of fundamental electrolyte design for SIBs operating under harsh conditions.",

        "title": "The effect of configurational entropy on acoustic emission of P2-type layered oxide cathodes for sodium-ion batteries",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) see intensive research and commercialization efforts, aiming to establish them as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries. Among the reported cathode material families for SIBs, Na-deficient P2-type layered oxides are promising candidates, benefiting from fast sodium diffusion and therefore high charge/discharge rates. However, upon sodium extraction at high potentials, a transition from the P2 to O2 phase occurs, with the corresponding change in cell volume resulting in particle fracture and capacity degradation. A possible solution to this is to increase configurational entropy by introducing more elements into the transition-metal layer (so-called high-entropy concept), leading to some kind of structural stabilization. In this work, the acoustic emission (AE) of a series of P2-type layered oxide cathodes with increasing configurational entropy [Na0.67(Mn0.55Ni0.21Co0.24)O2, Na0.67(Mn0.45Ni0.18Co0.24Ti0.1Mg0.03)O2 and Na0.67(Mn0.45Ni0.18Co0.18Ti0.1Mg0.03Al0.04Fe0.02)O2] is recorded during SIB operation and correlated to the materials properties, namely change in c lattice parameter and cracking behavior. A structure-property relationship between entropy, manifested in the extent of phase transition, and detected AE is derived, supported by the classification of signals by peak frequency. This classification in combination with microscopy imaging allows to distinguish between inter- and intragranular fracture. Relatively more intergranular and less intragranular crack formation is observed with increasing configurational entropy.",

        "abstract": "Batteries are enablers for reducing fossil‐fuel dependency and climate‐change impacts. In this study, a prospective life cycle assessment (LCA) of large‐scale production of two different sodium‐ion battery (SIB) cells is performed with a cradle‐to‐gate system boundary. The SIB cells modeled have Prussian white cathodes and hard carbon anodes based only on abundant elements and thus constitute potentially preferable options to current lithium‐ion battery (LIB) cells from a mineral resource scarcity point of view. The functional unit was 1 kWh theoretical electricity storage capacity, and the specific energy density of the cells was 160 Wh/kg. Data for the cathode active material come from a large‐scale facility under construction and data for the SIB cell production is based on a large‐scale LIB cell gigafactory. For other SIB cell materials, prospective inventory data was obtained from a generic eight‐step procedure developed, which can be used by other LCA practitioners. The results show that both SIB cells indeed have considerably lower mineral resource scarcity impacts than nickel‐manganese‐cobalt (NMC)‐type LIB cells in a cradle‐to‐gate perspective, while their global warming impacts are on par. Main recommendations to SIB manufacturers are to source fossil‐free electricity for cell production and use hard carbon anodes based on lignin instead of phenolic resin. Additionally, since none of the assessed electrolytes had clearly lower cradle‐to‐gate impacts than any other, more research into SIB electrolyte materials with low environmental and resource impacts should be prioritized. An improvement of the SIB cell production model would be to obtain large‐scale production data specific to SIB cells.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have garnered extensive attentions in recent years as a low-cost alternative to lithium-ion batteries. However, achieving both high capacity and long cyclability in cathode materials remains a challenge for SIB commercialization. P3-type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 cathodes exhibit high capacity and prominent Na+ diffusion kinetics but suffer from serious capacity decay and structural deterioration due to stress accumulation and phase transformations upon cycling. In this work, a dual modification strategy with both morphology control and element doping is applied to modify the structure and optimize the properties of the P3-type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 cathode. The modified Na0.67Ni0.26Cu0.07Mn0.67O2 layered cathode with hollow porous microrod structure exhibits an excellent reversible capacity of 167.5 mAh g-1 at 150 mA g-1 and maintains a capacity above 95 mAh g-1 after 300 cycles at 750 mA g-1. For one thing, the specific morphology shortens the Na+ diffusion pathway and releases stress during cycling, leading to excellent rate performance and high cyclability. For another, Cu doping at the Ni site reduces the Na+ diffusion energy barrier and mitigates unfavorable phase transitions. This work demonstrates that the electrochemical performance of P3-type cathodes can be significantly improved by applying a dual modification strategy, resulting in reduced stress accumulation and optimized Na+ migration behavior for high-performance SIBs.",

        "abstract": "The cycle stability and voltage retention of a Na2Mn[Fe(CN)6] (NMF) cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) has been impeded by the huge distortion from NaMnII[FeIII(CN)6] to MnIII[FeIII(CN)6] caused by the Jahn-Teller (JT) effect of Mn3+. Herein, we propose a topotactic epitaxy process to generate K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] (KMF) submicron octahedra and assemble them into octahedral superstructures (OSs) by tuning the kinetics of topotactic transformation. As the SIB cathode, the self-assembly behavior of KMF improves the structural stability and decreases the contact area with the electrolyte, thereby inhibiting the transition metal in the KMF cathode from dissolving in the electrolyte. More importantly, the KMF partly transforms into NMF with Na+ de/intercalation, and the existing KMF acts as a stabilizer to disrupt the long-range JT order of NMF, thereby suppressing the overall JT distortion. As a result, the electrochemical performances of KMF cathodes outperform NMF with a highly reversible phase transition and outstanding cycling performance, and 80% capacity retention after 1500/1300 cycles at 0.1/0.5 A g-1. This work not only promotes creative synthetic methodologies but also promotes to explore the relationship between Jahn-Teller structural deformation and cycle stability.",

The single‐layered MoS2 is confined in the carbon matrix. The mesopores between the composite nanorods provide fast electrolyte diffusion. The obtained nanocomposite shows a high sodium‐storage capability, excellent rate capacity, and very good cycling performance. A capacity of 310 mAh g−1 can remain at 5.0 A g−1 after 2500 cycles. Furthermore, a sodium‐ion battery (SIB) full cell composed of the MoS2/carbon composite anode and a Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode maintains a specific capacity of 330 mAh g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 during 100 cycles.

However, although the “rotten” transition metal (TM) migration phenomenon in layered oxide cathode materials leads to unfavorable structure reconstruction, sluggish Na+ diffusion and subsequent performance degradation, TM migration has not been systematically summarized and intensively discussed. Herein, a comprehensive insight into the recent advances of TM migration in layered SIB cathodes is provided, aiming to realize the “magical” utilization of TM migration. First, the negative effects of TM migration on crystal structure and electrochemical properties are discussed. Then, the origin of TM migration is intensively analyzed, and three main mechanisms of the migration are presented, including Cr4+–Cr4+–Cr4+ triplets, Jahn–Teller Fe4+ and Na‐free layers. Additionally, the latest research findings on exploring the origin are fully discussed. Finally, the suppression and utilization of TM migration are discussed, and the further exploration of TM migration and the future directions of suppressing/utilizing TM migration are outlooked. It is believed that this perspective will provide guidelines for the design of high‐performance layered oxide cathodes involving TM migration by turning the “rotten” into the “magical.”",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion battery (SIB) is a reasonable alternative to lithium-ion battery (LIB) in the field of grid-scale energy storage systems. Unfortunately, the development of appropriate cathode material is a bottleneck in the field of SIB. In the present work, (p-TQ)-VO, formulated as (p-TQ)0.2V2O5·0.38H2O, was synthesized based on a facile hydrothermal reaction of V2O5 and methylhydroquinone (p-HTQ). And when V2O5 was replaced by VN, (p-TQ)-VN, formulated as (p-TQ)0.22V2(O/N)5, was prepared instead. The (p-TQ)-VO sample displays good electrochemical performance as the SIB cathode. And (p-TQ)-VN shows a much higher capacity at a small current density, and it can maintain structural integrity with partial topotactic phase transformation into NaxV2O5 during the discharge/charge process. A series of characterizations of (p-TQ)-VO and (p-TQ)-VN reveals the successful intercalation of p-TQ into the layered V2O5 with a (001) lattice spacing of 13.7 and 10.7 Å, respectively. In (p-TQ)-VN, partial terminal oxygen (Ot) atoms from the V-O-V layer have been substituted by N atoms, which can boost the orbital hybridization of V 3d and Ot 2p, shorten the V-Ot bonds in the c-axial direction, and elongate the V-O bonds in the ab plane with compressed {VO4N2} octahedra, giving rise to mixed-anion coordination effect. As a result, the enhanced electron densities around the Ot atoms of the V-O-V layer can facilitate the affinity toward the inserted Na+ ions, leading to partial phase conversion into NaNO2/NaNO3. Moreover, density functional density (DFT) calculations reveal that the N-incorporation can improve electron conductivity with richer molecular orbital energy levels, resulting in multistep redox reactions and enhanced capacity.",

Herein, we have synthesized ultrasmall TiO2-nanoparticle-coated reduced graphene oxide (TiO2@RGO) composites by using a one-pot hydrolysis method, which are then investigated as anode materials for SIBs. The morphology of TiO2@RGO has been characterized using transmission electron microscopy, indicating that the TiO2 nanospheres uniformly grow on the surface of the RGO nanosheet. As-prepared TiO2@RGO composites exhibited a promising electrochemical performance in terms of cycling stability and rate capability, especially the initial cycle Coulombic efficiency of 60.7%, which is higher than that in previous reports. The kinetics of the electrode reaction has been investigated by cyclic voltammetry. The results indicate that the sodium-ion intercalation/extraction behavior is not controlled by the semiinfinite diffusion process, which gives rise to an outstanding rate performance.

The development of high-performance cathode and anode materials is a big challenge for SIBs.

Here, we demonstrate ball-milled TiNb2O7 (BM-TNO) as an SIB anode, which provides an average voltage of ∼0.6 V and a reversible capacity of ∼180 mAh g-1 at a current density of 15 mA g-1, and presents excellent cyclability with 95% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 500 mA g-1.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are in the spotlight because of their potential use in large-scale energy storage devices due to the abundance and low cost of sodium-based materials. There are many SIB cathode materials under investigation but only a few candidate materials such as carbon, oxides and alloys were proposed as anodes. Among these anode materials, hard carbon shows promising performances with low operating potential and relatively high specific capacity. Unfortunately, its low initial coulombic efficiency and high cost limit its commercial applications. In this study, low-cost maple tree-biomass-derived hard carbon is tested as the anode for sodium-ion batteries. The capacity of hard carbon prepared at 1400 °C (HC-1400) reaches 337 mAh/g at 0.1 C. The initial coulombic efficiency is up to 88.03% in Sodium trifluoromethanesulfonimide (NaTFSI)/Ethylene carbonate (EC): Diethyl carbonate (DEC) electrolyte. The capacity was maintained at 92.3% after 100 cycles at 0.5 C rates. The in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that no peak shift occurred during charge/discharge, supporting a finding of no sodium ion intercalates in the nano-graphite layer. Its low cost, high capacity and high coulombic efficiency indicate that hard carbon is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Red phosphorus (RP) as the anode material for sodium-ion battery (SIB) owns a high energy density, but the poor electronic conductivity and huge volume change during Na+ insertion/extraction restrict its application. In this work, the edible fungus slag-derived porous carbon (PC) is adopted as a carbon matrix to combine with RP to form PC@RP composites through a facile vaporization-condensation approach. The nano-sized RP particles are uniformly distributed in the PC matrix. The conductive porous carbon architecture improves the transfer of electron and Na+ in the composite. The robust carbon framework together with the chemical bonding between PC and RP effectively buffer the huge volumetric change of RP. As a result, the PC@RP composite material delivers a specific capacity of 670 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 with a capacity retention of 87% after 100 charging/discharging cycles. In particular, the full SIB assembled with P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn1/3Ti1/3O2 as the cathode material and PC@RP as the anode material exhibits a specific capacity of 77.3 mA h g-1 (based on the mass of the composite cathode material) at 0.5 C, and 85% capacity is retained after 100 charging/discharging cycles.",

Special emphasis was laid on the purity of the synthesized RTILs and a consistent and uniform characterization of their physicochemical properties. Evaluation of the viscosity, conductivity, and thermal and electrochemical stabilities resulted in clear structure-property relationships, rendering the ether functionalized RTILs most promising for application in SIBs. Electrochemical investigations of the ether functionalized IL electrolytes in SIB half cells (Na0.6Mn0.9Co0.1O2 as cathode material) proved their compatibility with a SIB system. Stable cycling performance was achieved with the piperidinium based RTIL IL 6 outperforming the organic electrolyte by far with a retention of 81% after 350 cycles. These results show the suitability of RTILs to enhance the performance of SIB systems and serve as a basis for the design of high performance IL electrolytes.",

However, the synthesis of pure-phase material has remained a challenge, and the phase evolution during sodium (de)intercalation is debating as well. Herein, a solid-solution strategy is proposed to partition Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 into 2NaFePO4·Na2FeP2O7 from the angle of molecular composition. Via regulating the starting ratio of NaFePO4 and Na2FeP2O7 during the synthesis process, the nonstoichiometric pure-phase material could be successfully synthesized within a narrow NaFePO4 content between 1.6 and 1.2.

The model Na3.4Fe2.4(PO4)1.4P2O7 cathode (the content of NaFePO4 equals 1.4) demonstrates exceptional sodium storage performances, including ultrahigh rate capability under 100 C and ultralong cycle life over 14000 cycles. Furthermore, combined measurements of ex-situ nuclear magnetic resonance, in-situ synchrotron diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy clearly reveal a two-phase transition during Na+ extraction/insertion, which provides a new insight into the ionic storage process for such kind of mixed-anion-group Fe-based phosphate materials and pave the way for the development of high-power sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Since sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have become increasingly commercialized in recent years, Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPOF) offers promising economic potential as a cathode for SIBs because of its high operating voltage and energy density. According to reports, NVPOF performs poorly in normal commercial poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) binder systems and performs best in combination with aqueous binder. Although in line with the concept of green and sustainable development for future electrode preparation, aqueous binders are challenging to achieve high active material loadings at the electrode level, and their relatively high surface tension tends to cause the active material on the electrode sheet to crack or even peel off from the collector. Herein, a cross-linkable and easily commercial hybrid binder constructed by intermolecular hydrogen bonding (named HPP) has been developed and utilized in an NVPOF system, which enables the generation of a stable cathode electrolyte interphase on the surface of active materials. According to theoretical simulations, the HPP binder enhances electronic/ionic conductivity, which greatly lowers the energy barrier for Na+ migration. Additionally, the strong hydrogen-bond interactions between the HPP binder and NVPOF effectively prevent electrolyte corrosion and transition-metal dissolution, lessen the lattice volume effect, and ensure structural stability during cycling. The HPP-based NVPOF offers considerably improved rate capability and cycling performance, benefiting from these benefits. This comprehensive binder can be extended to the development of next-generation energy storage technologies with superior performance.",

Combining X‐ray absorption spectra and first‐principles calculations, the varied elemental functions in the high‐entropy framework are clearly elucidated, namely, Ni/Fe/Cu acts as charge compensators, while Mn/Zn/Sn serve as interlayer slipping inhibitors through enhanced charge localization besides their stable valence states. By addressing the volumetric strain and cycling instability concerns for O3‐type cathode materials, this work presents a promising strategy for inhibiting irreversible phase transitions and structural degradation in intercalation electrodes, which significantly boosts the development of commercially feasible cathodes for high‐performance SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) (NFPP) is regarded as a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to its low cost, easy manufacture, environmental purity, high structural stability, unique three-dimensional Na-ion diffusion channels, and appropriate working voltage. However, for NFPP, the low conductivity of electrons and ions limits their capacity and power density. The generation of NaFeP2O7 and NaFePO4 inhibits the diffusion of sodium ions and reduces reversible capacity and rate performance during the manufacturing process in synthesis methods. Herein, we report an entropy-driven approach to enhance the electronic conductivity and, concurrently, phase purity of NFPP as the superior cathode in sodium-ion batteries. This approach was realized via Ti ions substituting different ratios of Fe-occupied sites in the NFPP lattice (denoted as NTFPP-X, T is the Ti in the lattice, X is the ratio of Ti-substitution) with the configurational entropic increment of the lattice structures from 0.68 R to 0.79 R. Specifically, 5% Ti-substituted lattice (NTFPP-0.05) inducing entropic augmentation not only improves the electronic conductivity from 7.1 × 10-2 S/m to 8.6 × 10-2 S/m but also generates the pure-phase of NFPP (suppressing the impure phases of the NaFeP2O7 and NaFePO4) of the lattice structure, which is validated by a series of characterizations, including powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density functional theory (DFT). Benefiting from the Ti replacement in the lattice, the optimal NTFPP-0.05 composite shows a high first discharge capacity (118.5 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C), superior rate performance (70.5 mAh g-1 at 10 C), and excellent long cycling life (1200 cycles at 10 C with capacity retention of 86.9%). This research proposes a new entropy-driven approach to improve the electrochemical performance of NFPP and reports a low-cost, ultrastable, and high-rate cathode material of NTFPP-0.05 for SIBs.",

And the electron transfer between V3+/4+ redox couple in NVP could be generally achieved, owing to the confined crystal variation during battery service. However, the more favorable V4+/5+ redox couple is still in hard‐to‐access situation due to the high barrier and further brings about the corresponding inefficiency in energy densities. In this work, the multilevel redox in NVP frame (MLNP) alters reaction pathway to undergo homeostatic solid solution process and breaks the high barrier of V4+/5+ at high voltage, taking by progressive transition metal (V, Fe, Ti, and Cr) redox couple. The diversified reaction paths across diffusion barriers could be realized by distinctive release/uptake of inactive Na1 site, confirmed by the calculations of density functional theory. Thereby its volume change is merely 1.73% during the multielectron‐transfer process (≈2.77 electrons). MLNP cathode could achieve an impressive energy density of 440 Wh kg−1, driving the leading development of MLNP among other NASICON structure SIBs. The integration of multiple redox couples with low strain modulates the reaction pathway effectively and will open a new avenue for fabricating high‐performance cathodes in SIBs.",

The optimized Na(Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3)0.97Ta0.03O2 sample achieved a reversible capacity of 162.6 mAh g−1 at a current rate of 0.1 C and 73.2 mAh g−1 at a high rate of 10 C. Additionally, the average charge/discharge potential retention reached 98% after 100 cycles, significantly mitigating the voltage decay. This work demonstrates a significant contribution towards the practical utilization of NFM cathodes in the SIBs energy storage field.",

        "abstract": "Cycling stability is the biggest challenge for cathodes of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), which is directly affected by the structure design. Herein, the combination of high‐entropy (HE) and multiphase structure is demonstrated to be helpful for maintaining the structure and improving the cycling stability. In the Ni/Mn/Cu/Ti/Sn five‐component HE multiphase cathode, the multiple elements at transition metal sites can enlarge the lattice and stabilize the structure simultaneously without causing an obvious capacity drop, achieving the synergistic effect of multi‐cations. In the HE cathodes consisting of P2 and O3 phases, the harmful phase transition in high‐voltage is suppressed and the cycling performance is improved. A capacity retention of 77.3 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles is delivered, and an improved rate performance of 88.7 mAh g−1 at 750 mA g−1 is observed, better than that of the low‐entropy multiphase cathode(P2 and O3) and the HE oxide single O3‐phase cathode. The weighted average ionic radius(WAIR) of all transition metals is demonstrated critical for the formation of the phase composition in HE composites. Through comparing a series of HE and multiphase cathodes, an empirical range of WAIR is obtained, which shows guidance for the design of other cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "P2-type Fe-Mn-based oxides offer excellent discharge specific capacity and are as affordable as typical layered oxide cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). After Cu modification, though they can improve the cycling performance and air stability, the discharge specific capacity will be reduced. Considering the complementary nature of biphasic phases in electrochemistry, hybridizing P2/O3 hybrid phases can enhance both the storage performance of the battery and specific capacity. Herein, a hybrid phase composite with high capacity and good cycle performance is deliberately designed and successfully prepared by controlling the amount of Mg doping in the layered oxide. It has been found that the introduction of Mg can activate anion redox in the oxide layer, resulting in a significant increase in the specific discharge capacity of the material. Meanwhile, the dual-phase structure can produce an interlocking effect, thus effectively alleviating structure strain. The degradation of cycling performance caused by structural damage during the high-voltage charging and discharging process is clearly mitigated. The results show that the specific discharge capacity of Na0.67Cu0.2Mg0.1Fe0.2Mn0.5O2 is as high as 212.0 mAh g-1 at 0.1C rate and 186.2 mAh g-1 at 0.2C rate. After 80 cycles, the capacity can still maintain 88.1%. Moreover, the capacity and cycle performance as well as the stability can still remain stable even in the high-voltage window. Therefore, this work offers an insightful exploration for the development of composite cathode materials for SIBs.",

To commercialize sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), higher energy density and lower cost requirements are urgently needed for NASICON‐type cathodes. Herein, Na3.5V1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 (NVFP) is designed by an Fe‐substitution strategy, which not only reduces the exorbitant cost of vanadium, but also realizes high‐voltage multielectron reactions. The NVFP cathode can deliver extraordinary capacity (148.2 mAh g−1), and decent cycling durability up to 84% after 10 000 cycles at 100 C. In situ X‐ray diffraction and ex situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations reveal reversible structural evolution and redox processes (Fe2+/Fe3+, V3+/V4+, and V4+/V5+) during electrochemical reactions. The low ionic‐migration energy barrier and ideal Na+‐diffusion kinetics are elucidated by density functional theory calculations. Combined with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fe with unpaired electrons in the 3d orbital is inseparable from the higher‐valence redox activation. More competitively, coupling with a hard carbon (HC) anode, HC//NVFP full cells demonstrate high‐rate capability and long‐duration cycling lifespan (3000 stable cycles at 50 C), along with material‐level energy density up to 304 Wh kg−1.

        "abstract": "O3-type layered oxides for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted extensive attention due to their inherently sufficient Na content, which have been considered as one of the most promising candidates for practical applications. However, influenced by the irreversible oxygen loss and the phase transition of O3-P3, the O3-type cathodes are always limited by low cutoff voltages (typically <4.2 V), restraining the full release of the capacity. In this study, we originally propose a dual-reductive coupling mechanism in a novel O3-type Na0.8Li0.2Fe0.2Ru0.6O2 cathode with the suppressed O3-P3 phase transition, aiming at improving the reversibility of oxygen redox at high voltage regions. Consequently, thanks to the formation of the strong covalent Fe/Ru-(O-O) bonding and inhibited slab gliding from the O to P phase, the cathode delivers the preeminent cyclic stability among the numerous O3-type cathodes within a high voltage of 4.5 V (a capacity retention of 95.4% after 100 cycles within 1.5-4.5 V). More importantly, HAADF-STEM and 7Li solid-state NMR results reveal the absence of transition metal migration and the presence of reversible Li migration during cycling, which further contributes to the improved structural robustness of the cathode. This study proposes an innovative strategy to boost the reversibility of anionic redox and to achieve stable high-voltage O3-type layered oxides, promoting the further development of SIBs.",

        "abstract": "P2‐type layered oxide material Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 is a competitive candidate for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, it suffers from the strong P2–O2 phase transition during charging to the high voltage regime, rendering drastic volume variations and poor cycling performance. Here, a Quasi‐zero strain P2‐Na0.75Li0.15Mg0.05Ni0.1Mn0.7O2 cathode is synthesized, which reflects the vanishing P2–O2 transition with a volume change as low as 0.49%, thus resulting in the material an excellent cycling performance (83.9% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 5 C). The low‐volume strain can be attributed to two aspects: (1) the Mg2+ riveted in the Na layer can act as a “pillar” to stabilize the crystal structure under the condition of sodium removal, thus restricting the structural changes under high voltage. (2) The entry of Li+ into the transition metal (TM) layer can mitigate the electron localization in the highly desodiation state and can effectively immobilize the coordination oxygen atoms, thus suppressing the slip of P2–O2 transition. This study not only provides a new insight of Li and Mg synergetic substitution effect on the structural stability of P2‐type cathode, but also an efficient avenue for developing cathode materials of SIBs with ultralow bulk strain.",

        "abstract": "Although the electrochemical properties of various cathode candidates for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are intensively studied on the material level, the evaluation and comparison from the perspective of future practical implementation are still lacking. In particular, air stability, which is often overlooked, will not only affect the electrode manufacturing processes but also cause detrimental structural change. Herein, two recently commercialized cathode products of NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) and Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) are adopted to evaluate their stability in ambient atmospheres and investigate the structural degradation mechanisms. Theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that the stability of NFM is significantly inferior to that of NVP during air exposure owing to the thermodynamically preferred chemical transformation of NFM. Furthermore, Raman mapping and X‐ray diffraction (XRD) measurements reveal the generation of alkaline, which accelerates the structural degradation of NFM. Accordingly, a simple second‐sintering strategy is proposed to enhance the air stability of NFM by removing impurities and retrieving surface‐precipitated Na+ into the crystalline host. In situ XRD reveals the stabilized crystal structure after the second‐sintering treatment not only effectively inhibits the chemical transformation of NFM in air but also endows the improved cycling stability (a high capacity retention of 90.7% after 200 cycles).",

CDP and ADN possess higher highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels (HOMO) than other solvents, leading to the preferential decomposition of CDP and ADN to construct an inorganics-rich CEI layer in situ on the PW cathode. Benefiting from this CEI layer, the degradation of PW is effectively inhibited during the long cycling.

        "abstract": "NASICON structured Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) has captured enormous attention as a potential cathode for next-generation sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), owing to its sturdy crystal structure and high theoretical capacity. Nonetheless, its poor intrinsic electronic conductivity has led to inferior electrochemical performance in terms of rate capability and long cycling performance. To address this problem, a combined strategy is adopted, such as (1) carbon coating and (2) high valent Sn4+ ion doping in the lattice site of vanadium in the NVP cathode. Carbon coating can effectively enhance the surface electronic conductivity, wherein high-valent Sn4+ improves the bulk intrinsic electronic conductivity of the materials. Moreover, Sn is a well-known alloying/dealloying type anode for SIBs; thus, doping of such metal in cathode materials will assume the role of structure stabilizing pillars and establishing high-performing cathode materials. Herein, Na3V2-xSnx(PO4)3/C (denoted as Sn(x)-NVP/C, where x = 0.00, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.1) were synthesized via sol-gel route, followed by calcination at 800 °C. XRD, Raman, XPS, and electron microscopy data confirmed the high purity of the synthesized cathode. The optimized Sn(0.07)-NVP/C exhibited excellent electrochemical performance in terms of high rate capability and long cycling performance, a high appreciable capacity of 98 mAh g-1 with capacity retention of 85% after 500 cycles. Similarly, at a high current of 20C, it is still able to deliver a stable capacity of 76 mAh g-1 with 85% capacity retention after 3000 cycles. The rate capability study indicates the high current tolerance of Sn(0.07)-NVP/C up to 70 C with a capacity delivery of 55 mAh g-1. It is worth mentioning that CV and EIS analysis for Sn(0.07)-NVP/C cathode displayed minimum voltage polarization and enhanced diffusion coefficient. Moreover, DFT calculation also proved that the electronic and ionic conductivity of NVP is promoted by Sn doping. Hence, the present results demonstrated that Sn(0.07)-NVP/C is considered a promising cathode for sodium-ion battery application.",

Therefore, the NMZVP@cPAN cathodes exhibited an outstanding discharge capacity of 70.6 mA·h·g-1 at 30 C and remarkable cycling stability with an admirable retention of 89.64% after 1000 cycles at 5 C. Rietveld refinement and ex situ X-ray diffraction analyses were performed to determine the change in the crystal structure. Density functional theory calculations were performed to determine the effects of Zn doping on the density of states and the migration energy barriers. Finally, the NMZVP@cPAN cathodes were successfully modified and could be used in SIBs as NMVP cathodes.",

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)3 is a promising high-voltage cathode for aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) and organic sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the poor rate capability, specific capacity, and cycling stability severely hamper it from further development. In this work, Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) with vanadium nitride (VN) quantum dots encapsulated by nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) nanoflowers (NVP/VN@NC) are manufactured as cathode using in situ nitridation, carbon coating, and structural adjustment. The outer NC layer increases the higher electronic conductivity of NVP. Furthermore, VN quantum dots with high theoretical capacity not only improve the specific capacity of pristine NVP, but also serve as abundant \"pins\" between NVP and NC to strengthen the stability of NVP/VN@NC heterostructure. For Zn-ion storage, these essential characteristics allow NVP/VN@NC to attain a high reversible capacity of 135.4 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, and a capacity retention of 91% after 2000 cycles at 5 A g-1. Meanwhile, NVP/VN@NC also demonstrates to be a stable cathode material for SIBs, which can reach a high reversible capacity of 124.5 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, and maintain 92% of initial capacity after 11000 cycles at 5 A g-1.

However, NaxTMO2 suffer from multiple phase transitions and Na+/vacancy ordering upon Na+ insertion/extraction, which is detrimental to their electrochemical performance. Herein, we developed a novel cathode material that exhibits an abnormal P2-type structure at a stoichiometric content of Na up to 1. The cathode material delivers a reversible capacity of 108 mA h g−1 at 0.2C and 97 mA h g−1 at 2C, retaining a capacity retention of 76.15% after 200 cycles within 2.0–4.3 V. In situ diffraction studies demonstrated that this material exhibits an absolute solid-solution reaction with a low volume change of 0.8% during cycling. This near-zero-strain characteristic enables a highly stabilized crystal structure for Na+ storage, contributing to a significant improvement in battery performance.

        "abstract": "High electrochemical stability and safety make Na+ superionic conductor (NASICON)‐class cathodes highly desirable for Na‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, their practical capacity is limited, leading to low specific energy. Furthermore, the low electrical conductivity combined with a decline in capacity upon prolonged cycling (>1000 cycles) related to the loss of active material‐carbon conducting contact regions contributes to moderate rate performance and cycling stability. The need for high specific energy cathodes that meet practical electrochemical requirements has prompted a search for new materials. Herein, we introduce a new carbon‐coated Na3VFe0.5Ti0.5(PO4)3 (NVFTP/C) material as a promising candidate in the NASICON family of cathodes for SIBs. With a high specific energy of ∼457 Wh kg−1 and a high Na+ insertion voltage of 3.0 V versus Na+/Na, this cathode can undergo a reversible single‐phase solid‐solution and two‐phase (de)sodiation evolution at 28 C (1 C = 174.7 mAh g−1) for up to 10,000 cycles.

Recovering and regenerating the cathode material from spent power lithium‐ion batteries in an easy and environmentally friendly manner remains a significant challenge and an area of focus in battery research.

The high capacity retention, that stable for 300 cycles in LIBs and 300 cycles for SIBs, is also realized due to the stable structure.

        "title": "Debye Temperature Evaluation for Secondary Battery Cathode of α-SnxFe1−xOOH Nanoparticles Derived from the 57Fe- and 119Sn-Mössbauer Spectra",
        "abstract": "Debye temperatures of α-SnxFe1−xOOH nanoparticles (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20, abbreviated as Sn100x NPs) prepared by hydrothermal reaction were estimated with 57Fe- and 119Sn-Mössbauer spectra measured by varying the temperature from 20 to 300 K. Electrical properties were studied by solid-state impedance spectroscopy (SS-IS). Together, the charge–discharge capacity of Li- and Na-ion batteries containing Sn100x NPs as a cathode were evaluated. 57Fe-Mössbauer spectra of Sn10, Sn15, and Sn20 measured at 300 K showed only one doublet due to the superparamagnetic doublet, while the doublet decomposed into a sextet due to goethite at the temperature below 50 K for Sn 10, 200 K for Sn15, and 100 K for Sn20. These results suggest that Sn10, Sn15 and Sn20 had smaller particles than Sn0. On the other hand, 20 K 119Sn-Mössbauer spectra of Sn15 were composed of a paramagnetic doublet with an isomer shift (δ) of 0.24 mm s−1 and quadrupole splitting (∆) of 3.52 mm s−1. These values were larger than those of Sn10 (δ: 0.08 mm s−1, ∆: 0.00 mm s−1) and Sn20 (δ: 0.10 mm s−1, ∆: 0.00 mm s−1), suggesting that the SnIV-O chemical bond is shorter and the distortion of octahedral SnO6 is larger in Sn15 than in Sn10 and Sn20 due to the increase in the covalency and polarization of the SnIV-O chemical bond. Debye temperatures determined from 57Fe-Mössbauer spectra measured at the low temperature were 210 K, 228 K, and 250 K for Sn10, Sn15, and Sn20, while that of α-Fe2O3 was 324 K. Similarly, the Debye temperature of 199, 251, and 269 K for Sn10, Sn15, and Sn20 were estimated from the temperature-dependent 119Sn-Mössbauer spectra, which were significantly smaller than that of BaSnO3 (=658 K) and SnO2 (=382 K). These results suggest that Fe and Sn are a weakly bound lattice in goethite NPs with low crystallinity. Modification of NPs and addition of Sn has a positive effect, resulting in an increase in DC conductivity of almost 5 orders of magnitude, from a σDC value of 9.37 × 10−7 (Ω cm)−1 for pure goethite Sn (Sn0) up to DC plateau for samples containing 0.15 and 0.20 Sn (Sn15 and Sn20) with a DC value of ~4 × 10−7 (Ω cm)−1 @423 K. This non-linear conductivity pattern and levelling at a higher Sn content suggests that structural modifications have a notable impact on electron transport, which is primarily governed by the thermally activated via three-dimensional hopping of small polarons (SPH). Measurements of SIB performance, including the Sn100x cathode under a current density of 50 mA g−1, showed initial capacities of 81 and 85 mAh g−1 for Sn0 and Sn15, which were larger than the others. The large initial capacities were measured at a current density of 5 mA g−1 found at 170 and 182 mAh g−1 for Sn15 and Sn20, respectively. It is concluded that tin-goethite NPs are an excellent material for a secondary battery cathode and that Sn15 is the best cathode among the studied Sn100x NPs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to the abundance and low cost of sodium resources. Cathode material plays a crucial role in the performance of sodium ion batteries determining the capacity, cycling stability, and rate capability. Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is a promising cathode material due to its stable three-dimensional NASICON structure, but its discharge capacity is low and its decay is serious with the increase of cycle period. We focused on modifying NVP cathode material by coating carbon and doping Nb5+ ions for synergistic electrochemical properties of carbon-coated NVP@C as a cathode material. X-ray diffraction analysis was performed to confirm the phase purity and crystal structure of the Nb5+ doped NVP material, which exhibited characteristic diffraction peaks that matched well with the NASICON structure. Nb5+-doped NVP@C@Nbx materials were prepared using the sol–gel method and characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Raman and Brunauer -Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. First-principles calculations were performed based on density functional theory. VASP and PAW methods were chosen for these calculations. GGA in the PBE framework served as the exchange-correlation functional. The results showed the NVP unit cell consisted of six NVP structural motifs, each containing octahedral VO6 and tetrahedral PO4 groups to form a polyanionomer [V2(PO4)3] along with the c-axis direction by PO4 groups, which had Na1(6b) and Na2(18e) sites. And PDOS revealed that after Nb doping, the d orbitals of the Nb atoms also contributed electrons that were concentrated near the Fermi surface. Additionally, the decrease in the effective mass after Nb doping indicated that the electrons could move more freely through the material, implying an enhancement of the electron mobility. The electrochemical properties of the Nb5+ doped NVP@C@Nb cathode material were evaluated through cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge tests, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and X-ray photoelectric spectroscopy (XPS). The results showed that NVP@C@Nb0.15 achieved an initial discharge capacity as high as 114.27 mAhg−1, with a discharge capacity of 106.38 mAhg−1 maintained after 500 cycles at 0.5C, and the retention rate of the NVP@C@Nb0.15 composite reached an impressive 90.22%. NVP@C@Nb0.15 exhibited low resistance and high capacity, enabling it to create more vacancies and modulate crystal structure, ultimately enhancing the electrochemical properties of NVP. The outstanding performance can be attributed to the Nb5+-doped carbon layer, which not only improves electronic conductivity but also shortens the diffusion length of Na+ ions and electrons, as well as reduces volume changes in electrode materials. These preliminary results suggested that the as-obtained NVP@C@Nb0.15 composite was a promising novel cathode electrode material for efficient sodium energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Compensating for the irreversible loss of limited active sodium (Na) is crucial for enhancing the energy density of practical sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) full-cell, especially when employing hard carbon anode with initially lower coulombic efficiency. Introducing sacrificial cathode presodiation agents, particularly those that own potential anionic oxidation activity with a high theoretical capacity, can provide additional sodium sources for compensating Na loss. Herein, Ni atoms are precisely implanted at the Na sites within Na2O framework, obtaining a (Na0.89Ni0.05□0.06)2O (Ni-Na2O) presodiation agent. The synergistic interaction between Na vacancies and Ni catalyst effectively tunes the band structure, forming moderate Ni-O covalent bonds, activating the oxidation activity of oxygen anion, reducing the decomposition overpotential to 2.8 V (vs Na/Na+), and achieving a high presodiation capacity of 710 mAh/g≈Na2O (Na2O decomposition rate >80%). Incorporating currently-modified presodiation agent with Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na2/3Ni2/3Mn1/3O2 cathodes, the energy density of corresponding Na-ion full-cells presents an essential improvement of 23.9% and 19.3%, respectively.

        "abstract": "Based on the favorable ionic conductivity and structural stability, sodium superionic conductor (NASICON) materials especially utilizing multivalent redox reaction of vanadium are one of the most promising cathodes in sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). To further boost their application in large‐scale energy storage production, a rational strategy is to tailor vanadium with earth‐abundant and cheap elements (such as Fe, Mn), reducing the cost and toxicity of vanadium‐based NASICON materials. Here, the Na3.05V1.03Fe0.97(PO4)3 (NVFP) is synthesized with highly conductive Ketjen Black (KB) by ball‐milling assisted sol‐gel method. The pearl‐like KB branch chains encircle the NVFP (p‐NVFP), the segregated particles possess promoted overall conductivity, balanced charge, and modulated crystal structure during electrochemical progress. The p‐NVFP obtains significantly enhanced ion diffusion ability and low volume change (2.99%). Meanwhile, it delivers a durable cycling performance (87.7% capacity retention over 5000 cycles at 5 C) in half cells. Surprisingly, the full cells of p‐NVFP reveal a remarkable capability of 84.9 mAh g−1 at 20 C with good cycling performance (capacity decay rate is 0.016% per cycle at 2 C). The structure modulation of the p‐NVFP provides a rational design on the superiority of others to be put into practice.",

        "abstract": "Hydrogen‐bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) have been widely researched and used in industrial fields owing to their relatively low weight and high pore volume. Furthermore, HOFs with redox‐active units have recently gained attention as electrode‐active materials for energy storage devices as well as other porous organic polymers. This study focuses on N,N‐bis(2‐isophthalicacid)naphthalenediimide (ECUT‐HOF‐30), which exhibits good redox and mechanical properties owing to the redox‐active imide units in heterocyclic compounds, and 1,3,6,8‐tetrakis(4‐carboxyphenyl)pyrene (PFC‐1) and 3,3’,5,5’‐tetrakis‐(4‐carboxyphenyl)‐1,1’‐biphenyl (TCBP) without imide units as relatively lightweight HOFs. We evaluated the battery performance using three HOFs with and without redox‐active imide units as cathode active materials for rechargeable lithium‐ion and sodium‐ion batteries (LIBs and SIBs). The HOFs maintained their cycle stability and battery capacities even by HOF formation and ECUT‐HOF‐30 with redox‐active imide units particularly exhibited good battery performance. These results imply the potential of rigid HOFs with redox‐active imide units for realizing high‐performance energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as a compelling alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), exhibiting comparable electrochemical performance while capitalizing on the abundant availability of sodium resources. In SIBs, P2/O3 biphasic cathodes, despite their high energy, require furthur improvements in stability to meet current energy demands. This study introduces a systematic methodology that leverages the meta-heuristically assisted NSGA-II algorithm to optimize multi-element doping in electrode materials, aiming to transcend conventional trial-and-error methods and enhance cathode capacity by the synergistic integration of P2 and O3 phases. A comprehensive phase analysis of the meta-heuristically designed cathode material Na0.76Ni0.20Mn0.42Fe0.30Mg0.04Ti0.015Zr0.025O2 (D-NFMO) is presented, showcasing its remarkable initial reversible capacity of 175.5 mAh g-1 and exceptional long-term cyclic stability in sodium cells. The investigation of structural composition and the stabilizing mechanisms is performed through the integration of multiple characterization techniques. Remarkably, the irreversible phase transition of P2→OP4 in D-NFMO is observed to be dramatically suppressed, leading to a substantial enhancement in cycling stability. The comparison with the pristine cathode (P-NFMO) offers profound insights into the long-term electrochemical stability of D-NFMO, highlighting its potential as a high-voltage cathode material utilizing abundant earth elements in SIBs.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) with low cost and environmentally friendly features have recently attracted significant attention for renewable energy storage. Sodium layer oxides stand out as a type of promising cathode material for SIBs owing to their high capacity, good rate performance, and high compatibility for manufacturing. However, the poor cycling stability of layer oxide cathodes due to structure distortion greatly impacts their practical applications. Herein, a high entropy doped Cu, Fe, and Mn-based layered oxide (HE-CFMO), Na0.95Li0.05Mg0.05Cu0.20Fe0.22Mn0.35Ti0.13O2 for high-performance SIBs, is designed. The HE-CFMO cathode possesses high-entropy transition metal (TM) layers with a homogeneous stress distribution, providing a moderated interlayer spacing to maintain the structure stability and enhance Na+ ion diffusion. In addition, Li doping in TM layers increases the Mn valence state, which effectively suppresses John-Teller effect, thus stabilizing the layered structure during cycling. Furthermore, the use of nontoxic and low-cost raw materials benefits future commercialization and reduces the risk of environmental pollution. As a result, the HE-CFMO cathode exhibits a super cycling performance with a 95% capacity retention after 300 cycles. This work provides a promising strategy to improve the structure stability and reaction kinetics of cathode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Layered transition metal oxides are widely considered as ideal cathode materials for SIBs. However, the existing P2 and O3 structures possess specific issues, which limit their practical applications. To address these issues, this work designed a novel intergrowth layered oxide cathode with P2 and O3 phases by implementing Cu and Ti into the structure with the formation of high-entropy cathode materials with superior performance for SIBs. The electrochemical test results show that the optimized high-entropy cathode with the P2/O3 intergrowth structure possesses a high initial discharge capacity of 157.85 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C, an excellent rate performance of 84.41 mAh g-1 at 10 C, and long-term stability with capacity retention of 83.25% after 500 cycles at 5C. Furthermore, the analysis results of ex situ XRD and in situ XRD indicate that the adverse phase transition of P2-O2 under high voltage is effectively suppressed. This work indicates that the integration of high-entropy strategy with the two-phase intergrowth structure can effectively stabilize the layered structure, suppress the slipping of transition metal layers, and improve electrochemical performance, which provides a new approach for designing high-performance and practical layered transition metal oxide cathode materials for advanced SIBs.",

Nonetheless, the practical specific capacity, especially under high current, is particularly frail due to the sluggish ion diffusion. In this study, the strategy of Ni substitution and formation of water-coordinated Fe is applied to lower the crystal field energy and elevate the active low-spin (LS) Fe content, which leads to a capacitive sodium storage mechanism, resulting in a substantial specific capacity under high current density. The delivered specific capacity of PW-325@2NiFe-55 is 95 mAh g-1 at 50 C, which is 72.5% capacity retention of the one at 0.5 C. Also, it maintains 80.2% of its initial specific capacity after 500 cycles at 5 C. Furthermore, a hypothesis of a joint diffusion-controlled and capacitive mechanism for high-spin (HS) Fe and a mere capacitive mechanism for LS Fe is put forward and verified through potentiastatic tests, operando 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy, and ex situ XRD, which provides a new horizon to enhance the electrochemical performance for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 is regarded as the most promising polyanionic cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its superior structural stability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental benignity. However, the low operating voltage inevitably weakens its competitiveness in energy density. Previous works have tried to enhance its operating voltage by Mn doping, which draws on the design idea of LiFexMn1-xPO4 cathode for lithium-ion batteries, but with little success. In this context, uncovering the role of Mn substitution in Na4Fe3-xMnx(PO4)2P2O7 (NFMxPP) cathode is urgently needed. This work discloses the effect of Mn contents on the structure, sodium storage property, and reaction mechanism of NFMxPP cathode for the first time. Introducing a moderate amount of Mn (0.6 ≤ x ≤ 1.2) into NFMxPP can weaken the Fe-O bonding interaction, thus leading to the full utilization of Mn3+/Mn2+ redox couple. As the representative, NFM1.2PP cathode exhibited a high operating voltage of ≈3.3 V with a reversible capacity of 109.2 mAh g-1. Note that a Hard carbon||NFM1.2PP full battery manifests considerably high-capacity retention of 92.3% over 1600 cycles. It is believed that an understanding of the role of Mn substitution in this work will promote the practical application of high voltage NFMxPP cathodes for SIBs.",

The Mn-O-Zn-O-Ti local structure formed after Zn incorporation inhibits the distortion of MnO6 octahedron and provides lower activation barrier for Na+ diffusion.

        "abstract": "Na4MnV(PO4)3 (NMVP) is considered as a promising cathode candidate for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) because it possesses a higher voltage plateau of 3.6 V (Mn3+/Mn2+) besides the voltage plateau of 3.4 V (V4+/V3+), lower cost, and environmental benign compared to Na3V2(PO4)3. However, such cathode still suffers from sluggish intrinsic Na+ diffusion kinetics and the Jahn‐Teller distortion of Mn3+, leading to low capacity and poor cycling performance. Particularly, the second‐step Na+ de‐sodiation in NMVP is the rate‐determining step owing to a lower chemical diffusion coefficient with one order of magnitude than that of the first‐step counterpart. To address these issues, a coordination environment regulation strategy is reported to develop a one‐step de‐sodiation NMVP cathode via introducing Zr4+ and K+/Ca2+ into Mn and Na sites, respectively. Based on theoretical calculations and electrochemical evaluation, the obtained Na3.3K0.1Ca0.1Mn0.8VZr0.2(PO4)3 exhibits much enhanced Na+ diffusion and efficiently inhibits the Jahn‐Teller distortion. Importantly, such modification significantly facilitates the second‐step Na+ diffusion of NMVP, realizing one‐step de‐sodiation. When employed as a cathode for SIBs, such cathode shows a specific capacity of 73 mAh g−1 (15 C), and capacity retentions of 92.7% after 3000 cycles (at 10 C, room temperature), and 72.6% after 1000 cycles (1 C, 50 °C).",

However, the cathodes in SIBs generally suffer from detrimental cathode-electrolyte interfacial side reactions and structural degradation during cycling, which leads to severe capacity fade and voltage decay. Here, we have developed an ultra-stable Na0.72Ni0.20Co0.21Mn0.55Mg0.036O2 (NCM-CS-GMg) cathode material in which a Mg-free core is encapsulated by a shell with gradient distribution of Mg using coprecipitation method with Mg-hysteretic cascade feedstock followed by calcination. From the interior to outer surface of the shell, as the content of electrochemically inactive Mg gradually increases, the Na+ deintercalation amount gradually decreases after charged. Benefiting from this surface gradient desodiation, the surface transition metal (TM) ion migration from TM layers to Na layers is effectively inhibited, thus suppressing the layered-to-rock-salt phase transition and the resultant microcracks. Besides, the less formation of high-valence TM ions on the surface contributes to a stable cathode-electrolyte interface. The as-prepared NCM-CS-GMg exhibits remarkable cycling life over 3000 cycles with a negligible voltage drop (0.127 mV per cycle).

NVPF nanocuboids with sizes of 50-150 nm distributed on rGO can be obtained, delivering excellent electrochemical performance such as a longevity life (a high capacity retention of 85.6% after 7000 cycles at 10 C) and distinguished rate capability (116 mAh g-1 at 50 C with a short discharging/charging time of 1.2 min). The full battery with a Cu2Se anode represents a capacity of 116 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1. The introduction of rGO can augment the electronic conductivity and advance the Na+ diffusion speed, boosting the cycling and rate capability. Besides, the small lattice change (3.3%) and high structural reversibility during the phase transition process between Na3V2(PO4)2F3 and NaV2(PO4)2F3 testified by in situ X-ray diffraction are also advantageous for Na storage behavior.

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are widely considered a hopeful alternative to lithium‐ion battery technology. However, they still face challenges, such as low rate capability, unsatisfactory cycling stability, and inferior variable‐temperature performance. In this study, a hierarchical Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) @reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/carbon nanotube (CNT) composite (NVPF@rGO/CNT) is successfully constructed. This composite features 0D Na3V2(PO4)2F3 nanoparticles are coated by a cross‐linked 3D conductive network composed of 2D rGO and 1D CNT. Furthermore, the intrinsic Na+ storage mechanism of NVPF@rGO/CNT through comprehensive characterizations is unveiled. The synthesized NVPF@rGO/CNT exhibits fast ionic/electronic transport and excellent structural stability within wide working temperatures (−40–50 °C), owing to the zero‐strain NVPF and the coated rGO/CNT conductive network that reduces diffusion distance for ions and electrons. Moreover, the stable integration between NVPF and rGO/CNT enables outstanding structural stability to alleviate strain and stress induced during the cycle. Additionally, a practice full cell is assembled employing a hard carbon anode paired with an NVPF@rGO/CNT cathode, which provides a decent capacity of 105.2 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C, thereby attaining an ideal energy density of 242.7 Wh kg−1.

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPOF) is considered a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) on account of its attractive electrochemical properties such as high theoretical capacity, stable structure, and high working platform. Nevertheless, the inevitable interface problems like sluggish interfacial electrochemical reaction kinetics and poor interfacial ion storage capacity seriously hinder its application. Construction of chemical bonding is a highly effective way to solve interface problems. Herein, NVPOF with interfacial V-F-C bonding (CB-NVPOF) is developed. The CB-NVPOF cathode exhibits high rate capability (65 mA h g-1 at 40C) and long-term cycling stability (a capacity retention of 77% after 2000 cycles at 20C). Furthermore, it shows impressive electrochemical performance at temperatures as low as -40 °C, delivering a capacity of 56 mA h g-1 at 10C and a capacity retention of ∼80% after 500 cycles at 2C. The interfacial V-F-C bond engineering significantly advances the electronic conductivity, Na+ diffusion, as well as interface compatibility at -40 °C. This study provides a novel idea for improving the electrochemical performance of NVPOF-based cathodes for SIBs aiming for low-temperature applications.",

        "abstract": "P2-type layered transition-metal (TM) oxides, NaxTMO2, are highly promising as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their excellent rate capability and affordability. However, P2-type NaxTMO2 is afflicted by issues such as Na+/vacancy ordering and multiple phase transitions during Na-extraction/insertion, leading to staircase-like voltage profiles. In this study, we employ a combination of high Na content and Li dual-site substitution strategies to enhance the structural stability of a P2-type layered oxide (Na0.80Li0.024[Li0.065Ni0.22Mn0.66]O2). The experimental results reveal that these approaches facilitate the oxidation of Mn ions to a higher valence state, thereby affecting the local environment of both TM and Na ions. The resulting modification in the local structure significantly improves the Na-ion storage capabilities as required for cathode materials in SIBs. Furthermore, it induces a solid-solution reaction and enables nearly zero-strain operation (ΔV = 0.7%) in the Na0.80Li0.024[Li0.065Ni0.22Mn0.66]O2 cathode during cycling. The assembled full cells demonstrate an exceptional rate performance, with a retention rate of 87% at 10 C compared to that of 0.1 C, as well as an ultrastable cycling capability, maintaining a capacity retention of 73% at 2 C after 1000 cycles. These findings offer valuable insights into the electronic and structural chemistry of ultrastable cathode materials with \"zero-strain\" Na-ion storage.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) have evoked much attention, benefiting from the advantages of low cost, high safety and excellent performance at low temperature. Especially, Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) cathode is considered to be one of the best candidates for SIBs cathode with abundant resources and long‐term cycling stability. However, the impurities of NaFePO4 (NFP) and Na2FeP2O7 (NFPO) formed synchronously with NFPP which restrict the further application of NFPP. It is meaningful to clear the formation process and regulate the contents of NFP and NFPO. Therefore, NFPP cathodes with different contents of NFP and NFPO were prepared through high energy ball milling cooperated with post‐heat treatment by controlling the Fe concentration in reactants. The NFPP‐2.85 showed the best electrochemical performance because of the high content of NFPP and transition zone between NFPP and NFPO which fasts the Na+ transport kinetics. When employed as cathode for SIBs, the as‐prepared NFPP‐2.85 showed a specific capacity of 111.8 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and maintained at 68.9 mAh g−1 even at 100 C. The retention ratio was as high as 93.6 % after 1500 cycles at 20 C, implying superior high rate‐long term cycling stability.

However, the construction of redox-bipolar COFs with the anions and cations co-storage feature for SIBs is rarely reported. Herein, redox-bipolar COF constructed from aniline-fused quinonoid units (TPAD-COF) is developed as the cathode material in SIBs for the first time. The unique integration of conductive aniline skeletons and quinone redox centers endows TPAD-COF with high ionic/electrical conductivity, abundant redox-active sites, and fascinating bipolar features. Consequently, the elaborately tailored TPAD-COF cathode exhibits higher specific capacity (186.4 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1) and superior cycling performance (over 2000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1 with 0.015% decay rate per cycle). Impressively, TPAD-COF also displays a high specific capacity of 101 mAh g-1 even at -20 °C. As a proof of concept, all-organic SIBs (AOSIBs) are assembled using TPAD-COF cathode and disodium terephthalate anode, which also show impressive electrochemical properties, indicating the potential application of TPAD-COF cathode in AOSIBs. The work will pave the avenue toward advanced COFs cathode for rechargeable batteries through rational molecular design.",

        "abstract": "O3-type cathodes with sufficient Na content are considered as promising candidates for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, these cathodes suffer from insufficient utilization of the active elements, restraining the delivered capacity. In this work, a high entropy strategy is applied to a typical O3 cathode NaLi0.1Ni0.35Mn0.55O2 (NLNM), forming a high entropy oxide NaLi0.1Ni0.15Cu0.1Mg0.1Ti0.2Mn0.35O2 (Na-HE). Results show that the active elements are fully exploited in Na-HE, with a two-electron reaction by Ni2+/4+ (further extended to Cu redox and even oxygen redox), vastly different from a one-electron reaction of Ni2+/3+ in NLNM. The full utilization of the active elements dramatically improves the output capacity of the cathode (122.6 mAh g-1 of Na-HE versus 81 mAh g-1 of NLNM). Moreover, the detrimental phase transition is well suppressed in Na-HE. The cathode exhibits high capacity retention of 88.7% after 100 cycles at 130 mA g-1, compared to only 36.4% for NLNM.

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) show the great potential to achieve large-scale energy storage due to their low cost and good safety as well as abundant resources of sodium. Among the cathode materials for SIBs, manganese-based layered oxides with adjustable structure have been attached great interest for the high energy density and low-cost SIBs. . Particularly, P2-type Mn-based materials exhibit anionic redox during charge and discharge processes, which can not only elevate the battery potential but also provide extra capacity, drastically boosting the energy density of the batteries. However, the irreversible phase transition, Jahn-Teller effect of manganese and interphase degradation at high charge cutoff voltage during anionic redox largely affect the cyclic stability of the cathodes. Therefore, it is essential to develop effective strategies to regulate the structural and interfacial chemistry for suppressing the phase transition and voltage hysteresis as well as increasing the cycle life of cathode materials. In this work, various electrochemical inert/active elements have been introduced into Mn-based P2 type cathode materials for regulating the electronic structure of the cathodes to promote more anionic redox and improve the structural stability. In addition, a new type of ionic liquid is introduced to build a stable interphase and improve the high voltage stability of the cathode material. Multi-model synchrotron-based X-ray characterization techniques combined with first-principles calculation are used to reveal the effectiveness of different strategies on the electrochemical properties of SIBs. The results provide valuable information for the development of high-performance cathode materials.\n \n Acknowledgement\n \n This work at Shanghai Jiao Tong University was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 22209106).",

Herein, pristine NVP and MWCNT@NVP composite synthesized via a facile solid-state method are examined and compared as cathode materials for Na-ion batteries. The morphological study confirms the uniform distribution of MWCNTs in the pristine NVP structure. Impedance spectroscopy clearly confirms more diffusion of Na ions for the MWCNT@NVP composite as compared to pristine NVP, considering its diffusion coefficient which directly implies on an increase in specific capacity. MWCNT@NVP (FNV-2) showed specific discharge capacity 110 mAhg-1 at 0.1C current rate which is almost stable at higher current rates with marginal fading. However, the pristine NVP shows capacity loss at a higher current rate. It is noteworthy that the MWCNT@NVP composite shows stable performance with marginal specific capacity fading (1%) compared to pristine (15%). This is because of the mechanical integrity and stability afforded to the composite by the intertwined MWCNT framework in the MWCNT@NVP composite matrix against electrode degradation during the electrochemical reaction. More significantly, even at a higher current rate, that is, at 10 C, the composite recorded a very stable and excellent Columbic efficiency of 97% with a reversible specific capacity of 94 mAhg-1 after 2000 cycles. An enhanced electrochemical performance, that is, rate capability and cycling stability, demonstrates the high potential of the MWCNT@NVP composite for Na-ion storage. Moreover, a sodium-ion full cell with hard carbon demonstrated a reversible capacity of 103 mAhg-1 at C/20 current rate, which clearly demonstrates that MWCNT@NVP is a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The layered transition metal oxides (NaxTMO2) are the most attractive cathode options for the rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high specific capacity, outstanding sodium desorption ability, and high average operating voltage. However, the kinetic behaviors corresponding to complex and prominent phase transitions are still perplexing. Here, we investigate the detailed electrochemical kinetic characteristics of the NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 electrode by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in three-electrode configurations assistance with the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) and trusted equivalent circuit models numerical analysis. The complex and prominent phase transformations evolution of O3-P3-O3' in the charge process and O3'-P3'-O3 during the discharge process are reflected at different degrees of frequencies and potentials, and significant contributions for the charge transfer step are established on this basis. As the charge and discharge proceed, the influence on charge transfer process by phase transform will be weak, however, which still has some expression and can be caught by EIS assistance with DRT. Additionally, a diagrammatic model for Na+ extraction/insertion is established to illustrate the physicochemical reaction mechanism in the NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 electrode. The results definitely provide certain scientific thoughts and guiding principles for the commercialization of NaxTMO2 in SIBs.",

Herein, we propose a surfactant-assisted molding strategy to regulate the pore-forming process in NVP/C composite cathode materials. More precisely, the forming process of the pores in NVP could be easily controlled by utilizing the huge difference in critical micelle concentration of a surfactant (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, CTAB) in water and ethanol. By reasonably modulating the ratio of water and ethanol in the solution, the as-synthesized NVP/C sample exhibited a three-dimensional interconnected structure with hierarchical micro/meso/macro-pores. Benefiting from these hierarchical porous structures in NVP/C, the structural stability, contact surface with the electrolyte, and electronic/ionic conductivity were improved simultaneously; whereby the optimized porous NVP/C sample exhibited an excellent high-rate performance (61.3 mA h g-1 at 10 C) and superior cycling stability (90.2% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 10 C).",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have shown great potential as energy storage devices due to their low price and abundant sodium content. Among them, O3-type layered oxides are a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries; however, most of them suffer from slow kinetics and unfavorable structural stability, which seriously hinder their practical application. O3-NaNi0.3Fe0.2Mn0.5O2 surface modification is performed by a simple wet chemical method of coating NaTi2(PO4)3 on the surface. The NASICON-type NaTi2(PO4)3 coating layer has a special three-dimensional channel, which facilitates the rapid migration of Na+, and the NaTi2(PO4)3 coating layer also prevents direct contact between the electrode and the electrolyte, ensuring the stability of the interface. In addition, the NaTi2(PO4)3 coating layer induces part of the Ti4+ doping into the transition metal layer of NaNi0.3Fe0.2Mn0.5O2, which increases the stability of the transition metal layer and reduces the resistance of Na+ diffusion. More importantly, the NaTi2(PO4)3 coating layer can suppress the O3-P3 phase transition and reduce the volume change of the materials throughout the charge/discharge process. Thus, the NaTi2(PO4)3 coating layer can effectively improve the electrochemical performance of the cathode materials. The NFM@NTP3 has a capacity retention of 86% (2.0-4.0 V vs Na+/Na, 300 cycles) and 85% (2.0-4.2 V vs Na+/Na, 100 cycles) at 1C and a discharge capacity of 107 mAh g-1 (2.0-4.0 V vs Na+/Na) and 125 mAh g-1 (2.0-4.2 V vs Na+/Na) at 10C, respectively. Therefore, this surface modification strategy provides a simple and effective way to design and develop high-performance layered oxide cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Stacking order plays a key role in defining the electrochemical behavior and structural stability of layer-structured cathode materials. However, the detailed effects of stacking order on anionic redox in layer-structured cathode materials have not been investigated specifically and are still unrevealed. Herein, two layered cathodes with the same chemical formula but different stacking orders: P2-Na0.75 Li0.2 Mn0.7 Cu0.1 O2 (P2-LMC) and P3-Na0.75 Li0.2 Mn0.7 Cu0.1 O2 (P3-LMC) are compared. It is found that P3 stacking order is beneficial to improve the oxygen redox reversibility compared with P2 stacking order. By using synchrotron hard and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopies, three redox couples of Cu2+ /Cu3+ , Mn3.5+ /Mn4+ , and O2- /O- are revealed to contribute charge compensation in P3 structure simultaneously, and two redox couples of Cu2+ /Cu3+ and O2- /O- are more reversible than those in P2-LMC due to the higher electronic densities in Cu 3d and O 2p orbitals in P3-LMC. In situ X-ray diffraction reveals that P3-LMC exhibits higher structural reversibility during charge and discharge than P2-LMC, even at 5C rate. As a result, P3-LMC delivers a high reversible capacity of 190.3 mAh g-1 and capacity retention of 125.7 mAh g-1 over 100 cycles. These findings provide new insight into oxygen-redox-involved layered cathode materials for SIBs.",

Although most of the studies have focused on single-phase cathode electrodes, these materials have difficulty in meeting the requirements in practice. At this point, composite materials show superior performance due to balancing different structures and are offered as an alternative to single-phase cathodes. In this study, we synthesized a Na0.44MnO2/Na0.7MnO2.05 composite material in a single step with cobalt substitution. Changes in the crystal structure and the physical and electrochemical properties of the composite and bare structures were studied. We report that even if the initial capacity is slightly lower, the rate and cyclic performance of the 1% Co-substituted composite sample (CO10) are superior to the undoped Na0.44MnO2 (NMO) and 5% Co-substituted (CO50) samples after 100 cycles. The results show that with the composite cathode phase transformations are suppressed, structural degradation is prevented, and better battery performance is achieved.",

Herein, a biphasic tunnel/layered 0.80Na0.44 MnO2 /0.20Na0.70 MnO2 (80T/20L) cathode delivering exceptional rate performance through subtly regulating the sodium and manganese stoichiometry is reported. It delivers a reversible capacity of 87 mAh g-1 at 4 A g-1 (33 C), much higher than that of tunnel Na0.44 MnO2 (72 mAh g-1 ) and layered Na0.70 MnO2 (36 mAh g-1 ). It proves that the one-pot synthesized 80T/20L is able to suppress the deactivation of L-Na0.70 MnO2 under air-exposure, which improves the specific capacity and cycling stability. Based on electrochemical kinetics analysis, the electrochemical storage of 80T/20L is mainly based on pseudocapacitive surface-controlled process. The thick film of 80T/20L cathode (a single-side mass loading over 10 mg cm-2 ) also has superior properties of pseudocapacitive response (over 83.5% at a low sweep rate of 1 mV s-1 ) and excellent rate performance.

        "abstract": "Layered manganese-based oxides (LMOs) are promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their versatile structures. However, the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn3+ induces severe distortion of MnO6 octahedra, and the resultant low symmetry is responsible for the gliding of MnO2 layers and then inferior multiple-phase transitions upon Na+ extraction/insertion. Here, hexagonal P2-Na0.643 Li0.078 Mn0.827 Ti0.095 O2 is synthesized through the incorporation of Li and Ti into the distorted orthorhombic P'2-Na0.67 MnO2 to function as a phase-transition-free oxide cathode. It is revealed that Li in both the transition-metal and Na layers enhances the covalency of Mn-O bonds and allows degeneracy of Mn 3d eg orbitals to favor the formation of hexagonal phase, and the high strength of Ti-O bonds reduces the electrostatic interaction between Na and O for suppressed Na+ /vacancy rearrangements. These collectively lead to a whole-voltage-range solid-solution reaction between 1.8 and 4.3 V with a small volume variation of 1.49%.

Herein, magnesium (Mg) is doped on the TM vacancies to form a disordered Mn/Mg/□ arrangement in the TM layer. The Mg substitution suppresses the oxygen oxidation at ∼4.2 V by reducing the number of the Na-O-□ configurations. Meanwhile, this flexible disordering structure inhibits the generation of the dissolvable Mn2+ ions and mitigates the phase transition at ∼1.6 V.

        "abstract": "It has been suggested that sodium layered transition metal oxides could potentially serve as excellent cathodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of their appropriate operating potentials and high capacities. However, the growing reliance on energy requirements has necessitated a higher energy density of SIBs. It has been demonstrated that activating oxygen-related activities for SIBs is a viable method to improve energy density. Herein, we suggest applying the synergy of Li and Zn codoping to activate the anionic redox reactions (ARRs) and improve their reversibility in Na0.75Ni0.3Mn0.7O2. The dual ion doping alleviates the phase transition and inhibits the Na+/vacancy arrangements, consequently improving the rate capacity and cyclic stability. The Na0.75Li0.15Ni0.1Zn0.05Mn0.7O2 delivers a discharge capacity of 134 mA h g-1 and no significant capacity loss at 100 mA g-1 between 2 and 4.5 V after 200 cycles. More importantly, the density functional theory (DFT) calculation proves that the codoping strategy triggers more ARRs compared to single-element doping, thereby providing enhanced capacity.

        "abstract": "The introduction of a superlattice structure into layered oxide cathode materials is a novel strategy to improve the structural stability of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the superlattice structure gradually disappears during cycling, which shortens the long life of SIBs. Here, the highly electronegative Zn is introduced into a P2-type layered oxide to regulate the superlattice structure. The obtained P2-Na0.80Li0.13Ni0.20Zn0.03Mn0.64O2 exhibits excellent cycling performance (the capacity retention is 96.7% after 100 cycles at 0.5C) and rate capability (95.8 mAh g-1 at 5C). Zn effectively inhibits the Li migration and the Mn dissolution, which ensures the integrity of the Li/Mn superlattice structure during long cycling, thus achieving an ultralong cycling life of SIBs. The introduction of Zn dramatically increases the length of the c-axis, leading to a faster de-embedding rate of Na+ and a better diffusion kinetics. Meanwhile, the larger pristine volume can withstand more stress/strain due to the sharp increase in the level of O-O repulsion during the desodiation process. In addition, Raman test results show that Zn can inhibit the Na+/vacancy ordering transition and improve the structural stability. This study confirms the feasibility of a Zn-regulated superlattice structure. It provides inspiration for the construction of stable layered oxide cathode materials for SIBs.",

        "title": "The Effect of Ni Doping on FeOF Cathode Material for High-Performance Sodium-Ion Batteries.",
        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage systems due to the abundance and low price of sodium. Until recently, the low theoretical capacities of intercalation-type cathodes less than 250 mAh g-1 have limited the energy density of SIBs. On the other hand, iron oxyfluoride (FeOF) has a high theoretical capacity of ≈885 mAh g-1 as a conversion-type cathode material for SIBs. However, FeOF suffers from poor cycling stability, rate capability, and low initial Coulombic efficiency caused by its low electrical conductivity and slow ionic diffusion kinetics. To solve these problems, doping aliovalent Ni2+ on FeOF electrodes is attempted to improve the electronic conductivity without using a carbon matrix. The ionic conductivity of FeOF is also enhanced due to the formation of oxygen defects in the FeOF crystal structure. The FeOF-Ni1 electrode shows an excellent cycling performance with a reversible discharge capacity of 450.4 mAh g-1 at 100 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles with a fading rate of 0.20% per cycle. In addition, the FeOF-Ni1//hard carbon full cell exhibited a high energy density of 876.9 Wh kg-1 cathode with a good cycling stability.",

However, they suffer from fast capacity fading owing to the complicated phase transformations, especially in high cut-off voltage (>4 V). Herein, Ti and Co elements were simultaneously introduced to O3-Na(Ni0.3Fe0.2Mn0.5)0.85Ti0.1Co0.05O2 (NFMTC) cathode material, and the effects of Ti/Co co-doping on phase structure and electrochemical properties were analyzed in detail. The results reveal that Ti/Co co-doping can enhance the {010} plane, interlayer space and Na-ion diffusion kinetics, resulting in the improved electrochemical performance. Therefore, the NFMTC cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 174.7 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C in the voltage range of 2.0–4.3 V and a good rate capability (53% of the initial capacity at 5 C) as well as an excellent capacity retention of 78% after 300 cycles at 1 C.

        "abstract": "Sodium–ion batteries (SIBs) are essential for large–scale energy storage attributed to the high abundance of sodium. Polyanion Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is a dominant cathode candidate for SIBs because of its high-voltage and sodium superionic conductor (NASICON) framework. However, the electrochemical performance of NVP is hindered by the inherently poor electronic conductivity, especially for extreme fast charging and long-duration cycling. Herein, we develop a facile one-step in-situ polycondensation method to synthesize the three-dimensional (3D) Na3V2(PO4)3/holey-carbon frameworks (NVP@C) by using melamine as carbon source. In this architecture, NVP crystals intergrown with the 3D holey-carbon frameworks provide rapid transport pathways for ion/electron transmission to increase the ultrahigh rate ability and cycle capability. Consequently, the NVP@C cathode possesses a high reversible capacity of 113.9 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and delivers an outstanding high–rate capability of 75.3 mAh g−1 at 6000 mA g−1. Moreover, it shows that the NVP@C cathode is able to display a volumetric energy density of 54 Wh L−1 at 6000 mA g−1 (31 Wh L−1 for NVP bulk), as well as excellent cycling performance of 65.4 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 2000 mA g−1. Furthermore, the NVP@C exhibits remarkable reversible capabilities of 81.9 mAh g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 and 60.2 mAh g−1 at 1000 mA g−1 even at a low temperature of −15 °C. The structure of porous carbon frameworks combined with single crystal materials by in-situ polycondensation offers general guidelines for the design of sodium, lithium and potassium energy storage materials.",

The structural characterization was performed applying various techniques, including X-ray diffractometry (XRD); thermogravimetry differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA); Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR); X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES/EXAFS), both measured at room temperature (RT); 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy recorded at RT and low temperatures (LT) from 20 K to 300 K; Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area measurement (BET), and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). In addition, the electrical properties of NixFe1−xOOH NPs were evaluated by solid-state impedance spectroscopy (SS-IS). XRD showed the presence of goethite as the only crystalline phase in prepared samples with x ≤ 0.20, and goethite and α-Ni(OH)2 in the samples with x > 0.20. The sample with x = 0.10 (Ni10) showed the highest photo-Fenton ability with a first-order rate constant value (k) of 15.8 × 10−3 min−1. The 57Fe Mössbauer spectrum of Ni0, measured at RT, displayed a sextet corresponding to goethite, with an isomer shift (δ) of 0.36 mm s−1 and a hyperfine magnetic distribution (Bhf) of 32.95 T. Moreover, the DC conductivity decreased from 5.52 × 10−10 to 5.30 × 10−12 (Ω cm)–1 with ‘x’ increasing from 0.10 to 0.50. Ni20 showed the highest initial discharge capacity of 223 mAh g−1, attributed to its largest specific surface area of 174.0 m2 g−1.

        "abstract": "Iron‐based pyrophosphates are attractive cathodes for sodium‐ion batteries due to their large framework, cost‐effectiveness, and high energy density. However, the understanding of the crystal structure is scarce and only a limited candidates have been reported so far. In this work, we found for the first time that a continuous solid solution, Na4−αFe2+α/2(P2O7)2 (0 ≤ α ≤ 1, could be obtained by mutual substitution of cations at center‐symmetric Na3 and Na4 sites while keeping the crystal building blocks of anionic P2O7 unchanged. In particular, a novel off‐stoichiometric Na3Fe2.5(P2O7)2 is thus proposed, and its structure, energy storage mechanism, and electrochemical performance are extensively investigated to unveil the structure–function relationship. The as‐prepared off‐stoichiometric electrode delivers appealing performance with a reversible discharge capacity of 83 mAh g−1, a working voltage of 2.9 V (vs. Na+/Na), the retention of 89.2% of the initial capacity after 500 cycles, and enhanced rate capability of 51 mAh g−1 at a current density of 1600 mA g−1. This research shows that sodium ferric pyrophosphate could form extended solid solution composition and promising phase is concealed in the range of Na4−αFe2+α/2(P2O7)2, offering more chances for exploration of new cathode materials for the construction of high‐performance SIBs.",

In this study, we propose a new NASICON-type Na4MnCr(PO4)2F3 (NMCPF) cathode and systematically investigate its key properties using first-principles calculations. NMCPF exhibits the ability to extract/insert three sodium ions per formula unit, resulting in a high specific capacity of 180.34 mAh/g, and demonstrates three-electron redox reactions involving three redox couples of Mn2+/3+ (3.05 V), Mn3+/4+ (4.11 V), and Cr3+/4+ (4.64 V). Consequently, its energy density can reach 709.33 Wh/kg. In addition, NMCPF exhibits a small volume change of 8.2% during the charging/discharging process and sodium ion diffusion properties comparable to those of NVPF. This study demonstrates the potential of NMCPF as a promising cathode material with high energy density for SIBs.",

In this study, we fabricated various Fe-V-incorporated hexacyanoferrates, which are Prussian blue analogs, via a one-step synthesis. These compounds changed their colors from blue to green to yellow with increasing amounts of incorporated V ions. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectrum revealed that V3+ was oxidized to V4+ in the cubic Prussian blue structure, which enhanced the electrochemical stability and increased the voltage platform. The vanadium ferrocyanide Prussian blue (VFPB1) electrode, which contains V4+ and Fe2+ in the Prussian blue structure, showed Na insertion/extraction potential of 3.26/3.65 V vs. Na/Na+. The cycling test revealed a stable capacity of ~70 mAh g−1 at a rate of 50 mA g−1 and a capacity retention of 82.5% after 100 cycles.

        "abstract": "Stabilizing Na+ accessibility at high voltage and accelerating Na+ diffusivity are pressing issues to further enhance the energy density of the Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, by taking a V/Cr solid-solution MXene as a precursor, a facile in-situ reactive transformation strategy to embed Cr-substituted NVP (NVCP) nanocrystals in a dual-carbon network is proposed. Particularly, the substituted Cr atom triggers the accessibility of additional Na+ in NVCP, which is demonstrated by an additional reversible redox plateau at 4.0 V even under extreme conditions. More importantly, the Cr atom alters the Na+ ordering at the Na2 sites with an additional intermediate phase formation during charging/discharging, thus reducing the energy barriers for Na+ migration. As a result, Na+ diffusivity in NVCP accelerates to 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than that of NVP. Eventually, the NVCP cathode exhibits extraordinarily high-rate capability (78 mA g-1 at 200 C and 68975 W kg-1), outstanding cycle stability (over 1500 cycles at 10 C), excellent low-temperature property, and full cell performance.",

Furthermore, the single‐phase reaction mechanism during the sodiation/desodiation process is verified by in situ X‐ray diffraction.

        "abstract": "Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are regarded as promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), but most of them suffer from an incompatibility between capacity and structural stability. Herein, an innovative disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (Na2EDTA)-assisted hydrothermal method is proposed to synthesize monoclinic Fe-substituted Ni-rich PBA (H-PBA) cathodes for Na-ion storage. The as-designed H-PBA cathode combines the merits of the low strain of a Ni-based PBA framework and the enhanced capacity of N-Fe3+/Fe2+ redox sites. It can achieve superior sodium-storage performance in terms of capacity, rate capability, and cycle stability. Moreover, ex situ measurements reveal that solid solution (2.0-3.0 V) and phase-transition (3.0-4.0 V) reactions occur during the charge/discharge process to allow almost 1.5 Na+ storage in the H-PBA lattice. Meanwhile, the H-PBA//NaTi2(PO4)3@C full cell also delivers remarkable electrochemical properties. Prospectively, this work would promote the practical application of SIBs in grid-scale electric energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted wide interest for energy storage because of the sufficient sodium element reserve on the earth; however, the electrochemical performance of SIBs cannot achieve the requirements so far, especially, the limitation of cathode materials. Here, a kilogram-scale route to synthesize Na2 FePO4 F/carbon/multi-walled carbon nanotubes microspheres (NFPF@C@MCNTs) composite with a high tap density of 1.2 g cm-3 is reported. The NFPF@C@MCNTs cathode exhibits a reversible specific capacity of 118.4 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C. Even under 5 C with high mass loading (10 mg cm-2 ), the specific capacity still maintains at 56.4 mAh g-1 with a capacity retention rate of 97% after 700 cycles. In addition, a hard carbon||NFPF@C@MCNTs pouch cell is assembled and tested, which exhibits a volumetric energy density of 325 Wh L-1 and gravimetrical energy density of 210 Wh kg-1 (base on electrode massing), and it provides more than 200 cycles with a capacity retention rate of 92%. Furthermore, the pouch cell can operate in an all-climate environment ranging from -40 to 80 °C.

Here, different electrolyte systems, including commonly used 1.0 M NaPF6/diglyme (NP-005), 1.0 M NaPF6 /propylene carbonate (PC)/5.0% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) (NP-009), 1.0 M NaClO4 /ethylene carbonate-dimethyl carbonate (EC-DMC) =1: 1 Vol%/5.0% FEC (NC-019) and 1.0 M NaClO4 /PC (NC-013), are systematically investigated and compared for NVPF1+2x cathode.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are on the verge of achieving practical applications, and the key is to find suitable electrode materials. The polyanionic iron-based material Na3.12Fe2.44(P2O7)2 (NFPO) possesses an open three-dimensional framework structure with good thermal stability and is regarded as an outstanding cathode material for SIBs. Nevertheless, its poor electrical conductivity, problems with erosion of electrolytes, and structural deterioration during cycling still need to be urgently addressed. Here, we first design a Mg2+-doped NFPO (NFPO-Mg) material with a dual-action effect. On the one hand, Mg2+ improves the intrinsic conductivity of the NFPO material, and on the other hand, Mg2+ promotes the formation of a homogeneous and stable cathode-electrolyte interphase film during the cycling process, which results in a superior rate performance and cycling stability. A capacity of 68.6 mAh g-1 was achieved at 50C (1C = 117.4 mAh g-1), and a capacity retention of 79.1% was maintained after 3000 cycles at 20C. More impressively, NFPO-Mg exhibits outstanding high-temperature electrochemical performance, with a capacity retention of 95.3% after 400 cycles at 10C at 60 °C (much higher than the 54.2% for the NFPO). This paper explores an effective method for improving the electrochemical performance of cathode materials, which may prove instrumental in guiding the design of more high-performance cathode materials in the future.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as an alternative candidate in the field of energy storage applications. To achieve the commercial success of SIBs, the designing of active materials is highly important. O3-type layered-NaFe0.5Mn0.5O2 (NFM) materials provide higher specific capacity along with Earth-abundance and low cost. Nevertheless, the material possesses some disadvantages, such as a low rate capability and severe capacity fading during cycling. To overcome such drawbacks, composite O3-type layered NFM with carbon has been prepared for the cathode electrode of SIBs through a facile solution combustion method followed by calcination process. The introduction of carbon sources into NFM material provides excellent electrochemical performances; moreover, the practical limitations of NFM material such as low electrical conductivity, structural degradation, and cycle life are effectively controlled by introducing carbon sources into the host material. The NFM/C-2 material delivers the specific charge capacities of 171, 178, and 166 mA h g−1; and specific discharge capacities of 188, 169, and 162 mA h g−1, in the first 3 cycles, respectively.",

Nevertheless, a formidable challenge lies in their high solubility in organic electrolytes, particularly for small molecular materials, impeding cycling stability and high capacity. This study focuses on the design and synthesis of organic small molecules, the isomers of (E)‐5,5′‐difluoro‐[3,3′‐biindolinylidene]‐2,2′‐dione (EFID) and 3,9‐difluoro‐6,12‐dihydrodibenzo [c, h][2,6]naphthyridine‐5,11‐dione (FBND). While EFID, characterized by a less π‐conjugated structure, exhibits subpar cycling stability in lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), intriguingly, another isomer, FBND, demonstrates exceptional capacity and cycling stability in LIBs. FBND delivers a remarkable capacity of 175 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.05 A g−1 and maintains excellent cycling stability over 2000 cycles, retaining 90% of its initial capacity. Furthermore, an in‐depth examination of redox reactions and storage mechanisms of FBND are conducted. The potential of FBND is also explored as an anode in lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) and as a cathode in sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). The FBND framework, featuring extended π‐conjugated molecules with an imide structure compared to EFID, proves to be an excellent material template to develop advanced organic small molecular cathode materials for sustainable batteries.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) employ P2‐type layered transition metal oxides as promising cathode materials, primarily due to their abundant natural reserves and environmentally friendly characteristics. However, structural instability and complex phase transitions during electrochemical cycling pose significant challenges to their practical applications. Employing cation substitution serves as a straightforward yet effective strategy for stabilizing the structure and improving the kinetics of the active material. In this study, we introduce a Ni‐rich honeycomb‐layered Na2+xNi2TeO6 (NNTO) cathode material with variable sodium content (x = 0, 0.03, 0.05, 0.10). Physicochemical characterizations reveal that excess sodium content at the atomic scale modifies the surface and suppresses phase transitions, while preserving the crystal structure. This results in enhanced cyclic performance and improved electrochemical kinetics at room temperature. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of the NNTO cathode material containing 10% excess sodium at a relatively high temperature of 60°C, where it exhibits 71.6% capacity retention compared to 60% for the pristine. Overall, our results confirm that a preconstructed surface layer (induced by excess sodium) effectively safeguards the Ni‐based cathode material from surface degradation and phase transitions during the electrochemical processes, thus exhibiting superior capacity retention relative to the pristine NNTO cathode. This study of the correlation between structure and performance can potentially be applied to the commercialization of SIBs.",

Therefore, recycling spent SIBs cathode is important and meaningful.

Results show that the highest Na leaching efficiency from Prussian white could reach 94.7% by polyethylene glycol 200:phytic acid (14:1) at 80°C for 24 h with a liquid/solid ratio of 50:1. Furthermore, the metal extracted from the leachate is found to precipitate when water is used as the anti‐solvent, with ammonium hydroxide achieving the highest precipitation efficiency of 89.3% at room temperature.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal fluoride (TMF) conversion cathodes, with high energy density, are recognized as promising candidates for next-generation high-energy Li/Na-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs). Unfortunately, the poor electronic conductivity and detrimental active material dissolution of TMFs seriously limit the performance of TMF-LIBs/SIBs. A variety of FeF3-based composites are designed to improve their electrochemical characteristics. However, the storage mechanism of the conversion-type cathode for Li+ and Na+ co-storage is still unclear. Here, the storage mechanism of honeycomb iron (III) fluoride and carbon (FeF3@C) as a general cathode for LIBs/SIBs is analyzed by kinetics. In addition, the FeF3@C cathode shows high electrochemical performance in a full-cell system. The results show that the honeycomb FeF3@C shows excellent long-term cycle stability in LIBs (208.3 mA h g−1 at 1.0 C after 100 cycles with a capacity retention of 98.1%). As a cathode of SIBs, the rate performance is unexpectedly stable. The kinetic analysis reveals that the FeF3@C cathode exhibit distinct ion-dependent charge storage mechanisms and exceptional long-durability cyclic performance in the storage of Li+/Na+, benefiting from the synergistic contribution of pseudocapacitive and reversible redox behavior. The work deepens the understanding of the conversion-type cathode in Li+/Na+ storage.",

However, the toxicity and expensive price of vanadium limit its practical application. Therefore, the substitution of vanadium with nontoxic and inexpensive transition metal elements is significant. We select the earth-abundant iron element to partially replace the vanadium element, and successfully synthesize Na3.36FeV(PO4)3 with a Na superionic conductor structure. Furthermore, a Na3.36FeV(PO4)3 cathode with an optimal carbon content can deliver an initial capacity of 97.6 mA h g-1 at 0.5C with a high capacity retention of 96.4% after 200 cycles. In addition, it also delivers an initial capacity of 90.4 mA h g-1 at 10C, and a capacity retention of 80% can be obtained after 5000 cycles. We also found that the lack of sodium in the material can be compensated by an electrochemical reaction. Furthermore, the in situ X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that the sodium storage process follows a pseudo-solid-solution reaction mechanism and the volume change ratio is less than 3% during charging/discharging. In order to study the practical application capability of Na3.36FeV(PO4)3, we assemble the pre-activated cathode and a hard carbon anode into a full cell, which exhibits high initial discharge capacities of 103 and 91.3 mA h g-1 at 0.5C and 10C, respectively.

Fluoride was selected as the anion dopant to give the general formula NaNi0.42Mn0.5D0.08O1.96F0.04, leading to a total of twelve different combinations of cation and anion co-doped structures. The screening criteria include the formation energy, which was used to confirm the thermodynamically favored locations of the dopants; the phase stability; and the volume change accompanying the transformation from the O3- to P3-phase after 50% desodiation. The calculations show that Te-, Sb-, Hf-, Y-, and Ti-F are the five most effective dual dopants for potentially enhancing the structural stability of the sodium-ion layered oxide during cycling.

        "title": "Theoretical study on Y-doped Na2ZrO3 as a high-capacity Na-rich cathode material based on anionic redox.",
        "abstract": "First-principles calculations based on density functional theory were utilized to study the performance of Na2ZrO3 (NZO) and yttrium-doped Na2ZrO3 (Y-NZO) as cathode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs), including the stability of the desodiated structures, desodiation energy, redox mechanism, and the diffusion of Na. When 62.5% sodium is removed from NZO, its structure and volume change little and the layered structure is retained, whereas the structure starts to distort and shift to the ZrO3 phase with the extraction of more than 62.5% sodium. As desodiation proceeds, oxygen anions act as the only redox center for charge compensation, yielding a high initial voltage of 4.03 eV vs. Na/Na+ by PBE + U-D3 functional and 4.82 eV vs. Na/Na+ by HSE06-D3 functional. When the desodiation content is less than 31.25%, O23- is formed with an O-O distance of 2.38 Å. At the desodiation content of 31.25%, peroxide dimer O22- starts to form; at the desodiation content of 56.25%, the O-O bond distance is further shortened to 1.3 Å, corresponding to the formation of superoxide O2-. However, for Y-NZO, the redox reaction firstly involves O2-/O1-, which does not occur in NZO. Peroxides and superoxides appear when the sodium removal concentration is 59.38% and 75%, respectively. This indicates that the O-O dimers appear in Y-NZO at much deeper sodium removal. The calculations of diffusion paths and barriers of Na ions in NZO by PBE + U-D3 predict that the barrier of Na escaping from the mixed layer to the Na layer in NZO is 0.48 eV (the reverse barrier is 0.76 eV), smaller than those of other O3-type layered transition metal compounds, such as Na2IrO3 and Na2RuO3. After yttrium doping, the diffusion of Na ions becomes easier, indicating that the Y-doping improves the diffusion ability. This investigation interprets the mechanism of oxygen oxidation of NZO as a cathode for SIBs, and provides theoretical support for a better design of Na-rich layered oxide Na2MO3 (M represents the transition metal element) in the future research.",

        "abstract": "The cathode materials of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have received considerable attention not only because of their abundant natural reserves and chemical properties similar to those of lithium-ion batteries but also their great potential in energy storage and conversion technologies. However, their low capacity and high diffusion barrier remain unsolved problems. In this work, we systematically studied the theoretical capacity and sodium ion diffusion barrier in a new family of layered transition metal compounds, named MX2 (M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, and Fe; X = C, N, and O), as the cathode materials of SIBs. The results indicate that all 2H-phase MX2 materials possess a high theoretical capacity of over 300 mA h g−1. Moreover, it is found that the 2H-phase CrN2 exhibits a desirable sodium ion diffusion barrier, indicating high mobility of sodium ions. In addition, the layered CrN2 has a remarkable voltage window (3.1–3.8 V) and outstanding electrochemical performance arising from the charge transfer between Na and N atoms, which is induced by the large electronegativity of nitrogen. Our research provides a promising candidate for application in SIB cathode materials in the future.",

        "abstract": "Polyanionic cathode materials that have high energy density and good temperature adaptability are in high demand for practical applications in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). In this study, a scalable spray-drying strategy has been proposed to construct interconnected conductive networks composed of amorphous carbon and reduced graphene oxide in Na3MnZr(PO4)3 microspheres (NMZP@C-rGO). The dual-carbon conductive networks provide fast electron migration pathways in the microspheres. Moreover, they significantly increase the porosity and specific surface area of the microspheres, which are conducive to accommodating the volume change and improving the electrode/electrolyte contact interface and the contribution of the pseudocapacitance effect to achieve fast sodium storage. As a result, NMZP@C-rGO exhibits excellent rate performance (50.9 mAh g-1 at 50C and 30 °C, 35.4 mAh g-1 at 50C and -15 °C) and long-term cycling stability (capacity retentions of 97.4 and 79.6% after 1500 cycles at 30 and -15 °C, respectively) in a wide temperature range.",

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) materials have emerged as a promising cathode for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, NVP is successfully optimized by dual-doping K/Co and enwrapping carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through a sol-gel method. Naturally, the occupation of K and Co in the Na1 sites and V sites can efficiently stabilize the crystal cell and provide the expanded Na+ transport channels. The existence of tubular CNTs could restrict the crystal grain growth and effectively downsize the particle size and provide a shorter pathway for the migration of electrons and ions. Moreover, the amorphous carbon layers combined with the conductive CNTs form a favorable network for the accelerated electronic transportation. Furthermore, the ex situ XPS characterization reveals that an extra redox reaction pair of Co2+/Co3+ is successfully activated at the high voltage range, resulting in superior capacity and energy density property for KC0.05/CNTs composites. Comprehensively, the optimized KC0.05/CNTs electrode exhibits a distinctive electrochemical property. It delivers an initial reversible capacity of 119.4 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C, surpassing the theoretic value for the NVP system (117.6 mA h g-1). Moreover, the KC0.05/CNT electrode exhibits the initial capacity of 113.2 mA h g-1 at 5 C and 105.8 mA h g-1 at 10 C, and the maintained capacities at 500 cycles are 105.8 and 100.8 mA h g-1 with outstanding retention values of 96.6 and 95.3%. Notably, it releases capacities of 99.8 and 84.5 mA h g-1 at 50 and 100 C, and the capacity retention values at 2500 cycles are 66.2 and 58.8 mA h g-1, respectively. What is more, the KC0.05/CNTs//Bi2Se3 asymmetric full cell exhibits a high capacity of 191.4 mA h g-1 at 2.65 V, with the energy density being as high as 507 W h kg-1, demonstrating the eminent practical application potential of KC0.05/CNTs in SIBs.",

        "abstract": "There are still many problems that hinder the development of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), including poor rate performance, short-term cycle lifespan, and inferior low-temperature property. Herein, excellent Na-storage performance in fluorophosphate (Na3 V2 (PO4 )2 F3 ) cathode is achieved by lattice regulation based on charge balance theory. Lattice regulation of aliovalent Mn2+ for V3+ increases both electronic conductivity and Na+ -migration kinetics. Because of the maintaining of electrical neutrality in the material, aliovalent Mn2+ -introduced leads to the coexistence of V3+ and V4+ from charge balance theory. It decreases the particle size and improves the structural stability, suppressing the large lattice distortion during cathode reaction processes. These multiple effects enhance the specific capacity (123.8 mAh g-1 ), outstanding high-rate (68% capacity retention at 20 C), ultralong cycle (only 0.018% capacity attenuation per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1 C) and low-temperature (96.5% capacity retention after 400 cycles at -25 °C) performances of Mn2+ -induced Na3 V1.98 Mn0.02 (PO4 )2 F3 when used as cathode in SIBs. Importantly, a feasible sodium-ion full battery is assembled, achieving outstanding rate capability and cycle stability. The strategy of aliovalent ion-induced lattice regulation constructs cathode materials with superior performances, which is available to improve other electrode materials for energy storage systems.",

        "abstract": "O3-type sodium-layered oxides (such as antimony-based O3 structures) have been suggested as one of the most fascinating cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Honeycomb-ordered antimony-based O3 structures, however, unsatisfactorily exhibit complex phase transitions and sluggish Na+ kinetics during cycling. Herein, we prepared a completely cationic-disordered O3-type Na0.8Ni0.6Sb0.4O2 compound by composition regulation for SIBs. Surprisingly, the measured redox potentials for typical O3-P3 phase transition are located at 3.4 V. Operando X-ray diffraction confirms a reversible phase transition process from the O3 to P3 structure accompanied with a very small volume change (1.0%) upon sodium extraction and insertion. The low activation barrier energy of 400 meV and the fast Na+ migration of 10-11 cm2·s-1 are further obtained by first-principles calculations and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, respectively. As a result, the O3-Na0.8Ni0.6Sb0.4O2 cathode displays a reversible capacity of 106 mA h g-1 at 0.1C (12 mA g-1), smooth charge-discharge curves, and a high average working voltage of 3.5 V during battery cycling.

        "abstract": "O3-type NaCrO2 is attracting increasing attention as potential cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Bare NaCrO2 is usually synthesized by a solid-state reaction and suffers from serious capacity decay and poor power capability. Modification by coating is an effective method to improve the electrochemical properties, but it inevitably reduces the energy density. To avoid the decrease of energy density and optimize the electrochemical performance, a specific route, i.e., a freeze-drying-assisted sol-gel method, has been adopted to synthesize bare NaCrO2 in this work. Three-phase coexistence during charging is confirmed for the first time, which contributes to delaying the disappearance of the O3 phase and then improving the structural reversibility, resulting in superior cycle stability (∼50% capacity retention after 3000 cycles at 5C). Meanwhile, as-synthesized NaCrO2 delivers an outstanding rate capability (82.1 mAh g-1 at 50C), which is attributed to the fast Na+ diffusivity and high electronic conductivity proved by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is worth mentioning that NaCrO2 also exhibits excellent electrochemical properties when used as a cathode for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs). This work provides new perspectives on the structural evolution of NaCrO2, and the results are expected to contribute to the development of SIBs and PIBs.",

        "abstract": "The layered Mn-based oxides (NaxMnO2), which is one of the most promising cathode families for rechargeable sodium-ions batteries (SIBs), have considerable attention due to their tunable electrochemical performances and low costs. Herein, a novel P2/O3 intergrown Li-containing Na0.8Li0.27Mn0.68Ti0.05O2 cathode material prepared by Ti substitution at Mn site is reported. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of biphasic composite structure and inactive element substitution, this P2/O3 electrode exhibits high initial charge/discharge capacity and excellent cycling performance. The combined use of different characterization techniques including XAS, HRTEM, EPR, and solid-state NMR gives insights into the local electronic environment, the redox chemistry, and also the microstructure rigidity of these cathode materials. On the basis of comprehensive comparison with Ti-free P2/O3 Na0.8Li0.27Mn0.73O2, the observed improvement on the electrochemical performance is primarily attributed to the alleviated Mn3+/Mn4+ redox and the excellent oxygen charge compensation behavior arises from the increased oxygen oxidative activity and reversible oxygen redox chemistry. From the viewpoint of structure evolution, Ti-substitution restrains the irreversible structural deterioration and Li+ loss during cycling. This study provides an in-depth understanding of the electronic and crystal structure evolution after inactive element substitution and thus sheds light on the rational design of high-performance P2/O3 biphasic Mn-based layered cathodes.",

However, the Jahn–Teller distortion from high-spin Mn3+ induces detrimental lattice strain and severe structural degradation during sodiation and desodiation. Herein, lithium is introduced to partially substitute manganese ions to form distorted P′2-Na0.67Li0.05Mn0.95O2, which leads to restrained anisotropic change of Mn–O bond lengths and reinforced bond strength in the [MnO6] octahedra by mitigation of Jahn–Teller distortion and contraction of MnO2 layers. This ensures the structural stability during charge and discharge of P′2-Na0.67Li0.05Mn0.95O2 and Na+/vacancy disordering for facile Na+ diffusion in the Na layers with a low activation energy barrier of ∼0.53 eV.

        "abstract": "The O3-type layered oxide cathodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as one of the most promising systems to fully meet the requirement for future practical application. However, fatal issues in several respects such as poor air stability, irreversible complex multiphase evolution, inferior cycling lifespan, and poor industrial feasibility are restricting their commercialization development. Here, a stable Co-free O3-type NaNi0.4Cu0.05Mg0.05Mn0.4Ti0.1O2 cathode material with large-scale production could solve these problems for practical SIBs. Owing to the synergetic contribution of the multielement chemical substitution strategy, this novel cathode not only shows excellent air stability and thermal stability as well as a simple phase-transition process but also delivers outstanding battery performance in half-cell and full-cell systems. Meanwhile, various advanced characterization techniques are utilized to accurately decipher the crystalline formation process, atomic arrangement, structural evolution, and inherent effect mechanisms. Surprisingly, apart from restraining the unfavorable multiphase transformation and enhancing air stability, the accurate multielement chemical substitution engineering also shows a pinning effect to alleviate the lattice strains for the high structural reversibility and enlarges the interlayer spacing reasonably to enhance Na+ diffusion, resulting in excellent comprehensive performance. Overall, this study explores the fundamental scientific understandings of multielement chemical substitution strategy and opens up a new field for increasing the practicality to commercialization.",

        "abstract": "Molecular dynamics (MD) together with the first principles method (DFT) reveal that Na+ is capable of migrating three dimensionally in a Na2Mn2Si2O7 cathode material. Migration along the a-axis and c-axis have the same mechanism, that is, alternating between the Na1 and Na2 route with a similar local environment and distance. Long-distance hopping between two Na2 atoms or between Na1 and Na2 atoms is crucial for continuous migration along the b-axis. Also, the anti-site phenomenon is identified, and it facilitates the migration of the Na ions. Four intermediate phases are determined according to the formation energy curve and, as a result, the voltage profile is predicted accurately. The state of charge (SOC) dependency of the Na+ energy shows that the mobility of Na+ is highly inhibited in the fully discharged state. Upon the deintercalation of sodium ions, Na+ is activated immediately. A maximal DNa+ value of 3.6 × 10-9 cm2 s-1 and a low energy barrier of ca. 0.26 eV at the deintercalation level of x = 0.25 are observed. Because of the scarcity of Na+, DNa+ experiences a sharp decrease at the end of deintercalation. Despite the low level of Na+ mobility in the range of 0.25 < x < 1, Na2Mn2Si2O7 is still a potential cathode material for use in sodium ion batteries (SIBs).",

However, the material suffers from severe capacity decay during the electrochemical reaction process. Herein, P2-Na0.67[Mn0.67Ni0.21Li0.06Zn0.06]O2 cathode is gained by moderately substituting lithium/zinc into the nickel sites. The inactive Li/Zn co-substitution is endowed with safeguard ability to stabilize the crystal structure, resulting in enhanced electrochemical kinetics and remarkable long cyclic performance in liquid & solid-state electrolyte.

Excitingly, it is also endowed with a high capacity retention of 85% after 500 cycles in solid-state batteries.

Herein, for the first time, layered NaxMO2 (M=Cu, Fe, Mn) cathodes are successfully prepared by directly using concentrated chalcopyrite ores as precursor. Greatly, the impurity elements like Si and Ca are found to be crucial in tailoring the phase structure of as-obtained layered oxides as P2 or O3 type, which removes away the traditional concern that the impurities may restrict the utilization of natural ores. More interestingly, a certain amount of Ca element remained in the Na sites through a self-doping process endows the P2-type products with enhanced structural stability. In half-cells, P2-type NaxMO2 with self-doped Ca element shows superior rate capability and cycling stability (56 mAh g-1 at 5 C, 90% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1 C). In contrast, less impurity elements are favorable for O3-type oxides to achieve high capacity of 107 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C and 84% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 2 C.

P2-type manganese-based layered oxides have received special attention by virtue of their high theoretical capacity, low cost, and environment friendliness.

In this work, copper substitution is used to suppress the Jahn-Teller effect of Mn3+ and affect the corresponding lattice structure. The water sensitivity and charge compensation mechanism were carefully investigated. Results demonstrate that water sensitivity of the electrode is related to the order of Na+/vacancy in the Na interlayers since water molecules are more easily inserted into the charged state electrodes, but the tendency for the uptake water does not increase with Na+ extraction. Furthermore, Mn2+ forms on the surface of electrodes in the initial discharge process, and the redox reaction in the bulk are predominantly between Mn3+ and Mn4+. Cu-substituted in TM layer affects the arrangement of Na+/vacancy and suppresses the Mn2+ formation on the Na0.7Mn0.9Cu0.1O2 electrode that results in superior air stability and better storage properties.",

Here, we synthesize a P2 type Na0.78Al0.05Ni0.33Mn0.60O2 material by small dose of Al replacing the Mn, aiming at enhancing the structural stability without sacrificing the average discharge voltage and theoretical capacity. The etching XPS and EDX mapping/line scan results indicate that the Al doping induces the dual effects of the Al2O3 surface coating and the bulk lattice doping, which efficiently suppress the accumulation of structural irreversible changes from P2 to O2, the volume changes and surface reactions at high voltage. Obvious improvements are further found on the diffusion kinetics of Na ions as well as the decrease of overall voltage polarization. Interestingly, the dual effects of Al doping lead to the significant increase of capacity retention after 50 cycles and improvement of rate capability compared with the undoped counterpart between 2.0 - 4.5 V. Hence, this work sheds new light on stabilizing the P2-Na-Ni-Mn-O materials, which provides a rewarding avenue to develop better SIBs.",

Herein, we report such a material, polyoxometalate Na2H8[MnV13O38] (NMV), with entirely different composition and structure from those cathode compounds reported before. Ex-situ XPS and FTIR analyses reveal that NMV cathode behaves like an \"electron/Na-ion sponge\", with 11 electrons/Na+ acceptability per mole, which has a decisive contribution to the high capacity. The extraordinary structural features, evidenced by X-ray crystallographic analysis, of Na2H8[MnV13O38] with a flexible 2D lamellar network and 1D open channels provide diverse Na ion migration pathways, yielding good rate capability. First-principle calculations demonstrate that a super-reduced state, [MnV13O38]20-, is formed with slightly expanded size (ca. 7.5%) upon Na+ insertion compared to the original [MnV13O38]9-. This \"ion sponge\" feature ensures the good cycling stability. Consequently, benefiting from the combinations of \"electron/ion sponge\" with diverse Na+ diffusion channels, when revealed as the cathode materials for Na-ion batteries, Na2H8[MnV13O38]/G exhibits a high specific capacity (ca. 190 mA h/g at 0.1 C), associates with a good rate capability (130 mA h/g at 1 C), and a good capacity retention (81% at 0.2 C).

The spherical, Co3+ substituted P2-Na2/3[Ni0.3Co0.1Mn0.6]O2 with a high tap-density of 1.86 g cm-3 is successfully synthesized by co-precipitation and solid-state reactions.

Apart from improved cycling stability ascribed to the mitigated P2-O2 transition, this cathode also shows a better rate property compared with those modified by Li+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, and Ti4+ doping and Al2O3 coating. Besides, the P2-Na2/3[Ni0.3Co0.1Mn0.6]O2|hard carbon full-cells deliver a reversible capacity of 150.6 mA h g-1 and have enhanced cycle-life and high-rate capability.

Rietveld refinement reveals that Na3.12Mn2.44(P2O7)2 adopts a triclinic structure ( P1̅ space group), which possesses spacious ion diffusion channels for facile sodium migration. The off-stoichiometric phase is able to offer more reversible Na+, delivering an enhanced reversible capacity of 114 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C, and because of the strong \"inductive effect\" that (P2O7)4- groups imposing on the Mn3+/Mn2+ redox couple, Na3.12Mn2.44(P2O7)2/C presents high platforms above 3.6 V, contributing a remarkable energy density of 376 W h kg-1, which is among the highest Fe-/Mn-based polyanion-type cathode materials. Furthermore, the off-stoichiometric compound also presents satisfactory rate capability and long-cycle stability, with a capacity retention of 75% after 500 cycles at 5 C. Ex situ X-ray diffraction demonstrates a single-phase reaction mechanism, and the density functional theory calculations display two one-dimensional sodium migration paths with low energy barriers in Na3.12Mn2.44(P2O7)2, which is vital for the facile sodium storage.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are promising candidates applied to large-scale energy storage systems owing to abundant sodium resources and high economic efficiency. Layered manganese-based oxides as a prevailing cathode for sodium-ion batteries have been extensively studied, where doping or coating have been demonstrated to improve the electrochemical performance. However, the binder which tends to be the popular PVDF, is revealed to generate swellability upon cycling, leading to electrode material crack and the disconnection with current collectors. For the above issues, in this work, environmentally friendly sodium alginate is utilized as the aqueous binder in conventional layered transition metal oxide cathode P2-Na2/3MnO2 for SIBs. Through credible comparative experiments, sodium alginate is testified to play an essential role in suppressing cracks on the surface of materials, preventing surge in charge transfer resistance and restraining detachment between electrode and current collector. Therefore, sodium alginate is proved to be an ideal binder to match with P2-Na2/3MnO2, where some issues existed before, as promising cathode material with excellent performance, low cost. This study displays that improving battery performance by exploring suitable binder systems can equal or even exceed the performance improvement through modification of material itself.",

        "abstract": "P2-type layered oxides have been considered promising candidates as cathodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high capacity and high rate capability. However, because of the difficulty involved in forming hierarchical microstructures, it remains challenging to develop high energy density P2-type layered oxides with good electrochemical performance and high electrode density. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of P2-type Na0.65[Ni0.17Co0.11Mn0.72]O2 as a very efficient cathode material for high energy density SIBs by synthesizing a micron-sized hierarchical structure via the coprecipitation route. The as-prepared P2-type microsphere cathode constructed from nanoscale primary particles provides a sufficient interface between the electrodes and the electrolyte solution, which enables to shorten the transport pathways for Na+ ions and electrons. Simultaneously, the hierarchical microstructure enhances the structural stability and high tap density (∼1.18 g cm-3). Benefiting from these merits, the proposed P2-type microsphere Na0.65[Ni0.17Co0.11Mn0.72]O2 displays a high discharge capacity of 187 mA h g-1 at 12 mA g-1 and an exceptional cycle retention of 74.7% after 500 cycles, even at the high current density of 600 mA g-1. In addition, the high tap density of this P2-type microsphere enhances the density of composite cathodes, which translates to a high volumetric energy density of 340 W h L-1 based on the overall volume of the cathode active mass and the aluminum foil current collector.",

Using a facile hydrothermal method, we grew V2O3 NWs on CCs and subsequently reduced them to V8C7 by annealing with carbon sources under a H2/Ar atmosphere. In striking contrast to V2O5 NW cathodes obtained by annealing under air, the V8C7 NWs exhibit outstanding cycling stability during 500 cycles, and good rate capability for both LIBs and SIBs. V8C7 NWs as cathode active materials for LIBs exhibited 203.9 mA h g-1 specific capacity at 0.1 C after 500 cycles, 91.12% cycling retention and a coulombic efficiency of 99.84%. As cathodes in SIBs, the V8C7 NWs delivered 176.34 mA h g-1 specific capacity at 0.1 C during 300 cycles. Their defect sites by removal of the oxygen framework in V2O3 NWs have a high surface area (183.27 m2 g-1) and the unique 1D NW structure highly mitigates the volume changes during charge and discharge showing a superior electrochemical performance. Compared to commercially available cathodes, V8C7 nanowires have very good cycling stability and enhanced electrical conductivity. Moreover, the synergistic effect with 3D CCs utilized here as a current collector provides a large number of cation-accessible active sites in conjunction with high electrical conductivity and chemical stability.",

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as a potential candidate to succeed lithium ion batteries (LIBs), because of the abundant sodium resources on earth. Layered vanadium oxides are regarded as the promising candidates for SIBs because of their large interlayer spacing, high theoretical specific capacity, abundant sources and low cost. In this paper, a vanadium oxide hydrate (H2V3O8) nanowire membrane is presented as a flexible cathode for SIBs without addition of any other additives (binders or conductive compounds). Such a freestanding flexible membrane exhibits a high specific capacity of 168 mA h g(-1) at 10 mA g(-1), and its high capacity is maintained well after 100 cycles. It is found that the capacitive charge storage accounts for a relatively large proportion of the total capacity, whereas the crystal structure of H2V3O8 is highly reversible during the sodiation/desodiation processes. This research demonstrates that the H2V3O8 nanowire is an exceptional candidate for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Vanadium oxide (V2O5), as a potential positive electrode for sodium ion batteries (SIBs), has attracted considerable attention from researchers. Herein, amorphous and crystalline V2O5 cathodes on a graphite paper without a binder and conductive additives have been synthesized via facile anodic electrochemical deposition following different heat treatments. Both the amorphous V2O5 (a-V2O5) cathode and crystalline V2O5 (c-V2O5) cathode show good rate cycling performance and long cycling life. After five rate cycles, the reversible capacities of both the cathodes were almost unchanged at different current densities from 40 to 5120 mA g-1. Long cycling tests with 10 000 cycles were carried out and the two cathodes exhibit excellent cycling stability. The c-V2O5 cathode retains a high specific capacity of 54 mA h g-1 after 10 000 cycles at 2560 mA g-1 and can be charged within 80 s. Interestingly, the a-V2O5 cathode possesses higher reversible capacities than the c-V2O5 cathode at low current densities, whereas it is inversed at high current densities. The c-V2O5 cathode shows faster capacity recovery from 5120 to 40 mA g-1 than the a-V2O5 cathode. When discharged at 80 mA g-1 (long discharge time of 140 min) and charged at 640 mA g-1 (short charge time of 17 min), the a-V2O5 cathode shows a higher discharge capacity than its c-V2O5 counterpart. The different electrochemical performance of a-V2O5 and c-V2O5 cathodes during various electrochemical processes can provide a rational selection of amorphous or crystalline V2O5 cathode materials for SIBs in their practical applications to meet the variable requirements.",

The superior cycling and high rate capability are attributed to the unique spinning vein fiber based porous structure offering a good intimate contact between NFPO@C and graphene for great electronic conductivity, fast ionic transport, a large reaction surface and a strong solid structure preventing collapse during cycling, thus achieving a high rate discharge performance and high cycling stability.",

        "abstract": "This research work focuses on the synthesis and performance evaluation of NaFexCr1−X(SO4)2 (X = 0, 0.8 and 1.0) cathode materials in sodium ion batteries (SIBs). The novel materials having a primary particle size of around 100–200 nm were synthesized through a sol–gel process by reacting stoichiometric amounts of the precursor materials. The structural analysis confirms the formation of crystalline, phase pure materials that adopt a monoclinic crystal structure. Thermal analysis indicates the superior thermal stability of NaFe0.8Cr0.2(SO4)2 when compared to NaFe(SO4)2 and NaCr(SO4)2. Galvanostatic charge/discharge analysis indicates that the intercalation/de-intercalation of a sodium ion (Na+) into/from NaFe(SO4)2 ensues at about 3.2 V due to the Fe2+/Fe3+ active redox couple. Moreover, ex situ XRD analysis confirms that the insertion/de-insertion of sodium into/from the host structure during charging/discharging is accompanied by a reversible single-phase reaction rather than a biphasic reaction. A similar sodium intercalation/de-intercalation mechanism has been noticed in NaFe0.8Cr0.2(SO4)2which has not been reported earlier. The galvanostatic measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirm that the Cr2+/Cr3+ redox couple is inactive in NaFexCr1−X(SO4)2 (X = 0, 0.8) and thus does not contribute to capacity augmentation. However, suitable carbon coating may lead to activation of the Cr2+/Cr3+ redox couple in these inactive materials.",

        "abstract": "For the first time, atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2 O3 was adopted to enhance the cyclic stability of layered P2-type Na2/3 (Mn0.54 Ni0.13 Co0.13 )O2 (MNC) cathodes for use in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Discharge capacities of approximately 120, 123, 113, and 105 mA h g(-1) were obtained for the pristine electrode and electrodes coated with 2, 5, and 10 ALD cycles, respectively. All electrodes were cycled at the 1C discharge current rate for voltages between 2 and 4.5 V in 1 M NaClO4 electrolyte. Among the electrodes tested, the Al2 O3 coating from 2 ALD cycles (MNC-2) exhibited the best electrochemical stability and rate capability, whereas the electrode coated by 10 ALD cycles (MNC-10) displayed the highest columbic efficiency (CE), which exceeded 97 % after 100 cycles. The enhanced electrochemical stability observed for ALD-coated electrodes could be a result of the protection effects and high band-gap energy (Eg =9.00 eV) of the Al2 O3 coating layer. Additionally, the metal-oxide coating provides structural stability against mechanical stresses occurring during the cycling process. The capacity, cyclic stability, and rate performance achieved for the MNC electrode coated with 2 ALD cycles of Al2 O3 reveal the best results for SIBs. This study provides a promising route toward increasing the stability and CE of electrode materials for SIB application.",

        "abstract": "The P2‐type layered transition metal oxide cathodes confront formidable challenges, including irreversible deleterious phase transitions, transition metals migration, and sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics, which hamper their rapid commercial application in sodium ion batteries (SIB). In this work, an entropy tuning with dual‐site substitution strategy is proposed to address the aforementioned issues. In the tailored [Na0.67Zn0.05]Ni0.22Cu0.06Mn0.66Ti0.01O2 (NZNCMTO) cathodes, the strategic incorporation of Zn ions serves to occupy Na sites, intentionally disrupting the Na/vacancy ordering and establishing a reinforcing “pillar” effect within the layered framework. Furthermore, the substitution of Cu and Ti for Ni and Mn bolsters covalent bonding with the lattice oxygen, thereby impeding the migration of the transition metal ions and leading to a near‐zero strain structural evolution during charge and discharge process. Density functional theory calculations confirmed that entropy‐tuned NZNCMTO substantially lowered the migration energy barrier for Na+ ions diffusion and improved electronic conductivity. Consequently, the NZNCMTO cathode exhibits an impressive high practical capacity of 91.54 mAh g−1 at a high discharge rate of 10 C, along with outstanding cycling stability, maintaining near 100% capacity retention over 500 cycles at a current density of 10 C.

        "abstract": "Micro‐sized bismuth (Bi) is recognized for its high volumetric capacity and suitable working potential, making it a promising anode candidate for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, its substantial volume changes and slow reaction kinetics during cycling detrimentally affects the SIB performance. Theoretical prediction uncovers a previously unexplored favorable attribute that bonding between nitrogen within a carbon coating and Bi atoms facilitates Na+ ingress into the Bi bulk, significantly enhancing Bi‐Na alloying reactions, mitigating volume expansion, and preventing Na‐dendrite formation. Experimentally, the study innovatively engineers a flower‐like micro‐sized Bi encapsulated within an elastic, nitrogen‐doped carbon framework (FBi@NC) working as an efficient anode for SIBs. This design enables FBi@NC anode achieving a high tap density of 2.86 g cm−3 and delivering a remarkable volumetric capacity of 1100 mAh cm−3 at 1 mA cm−2. It also exhibits exceptional rate capability (368.2 mA h g−1 at 30 A g−1) and super durable cyclability (10 000 cycles with 318.8 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1, retaining 82% capacity).

However, it still suffers from unsatisfactory stability, caused by the poor reversibility of the V5+/V4+ redox couple and structure evolution. Herein, we propos a strategy that combines high-entropy substitution and electrolyte optimization to boost the reversible multielectron reactions of NVP. The high reversibility of the V5+/V4+ redox couple and crystalline structure evolution are disclosed by in situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectra and in situ X-ray diffraction. Meanwhile, the electrochemical reaction kinetics of high-entropy substitution NVP (HE-NVP) can be further improved in the diglyme-based electrolyte. These enable HE-NVP to deliver a superior electrochemical performance (capacity retention of 93.1% after 2000 cycles; a large reversible capacity of 120 mAh g-1 even at 5.0 A g-1). Besides, the long cycle life and high power density of the HE-NVP∥natural graphite full-cell configuration demonstrated the superiority of HE-NVP cathode in SIBs.

To address these issues, a new strategy is deployed through introducing Fe vacancies and Cu‐dopant into the PBAs frame structure, boosting the specific capacity and improving the cycling stability. On the one hand, the introduction of Fe vacancies in PBA (PBA□Fe) can provide additional storage sites and facilitate Na+ diffusion kinetics, yielding a high capacity of ≈164 mAh g−1 at a low current density which approaches the theoretical capacity. On the other hand, the Cu‐dopant is further helpful in stabilizing the structure of PBA□Fe, thus improving the cycling stability.

However, it still needs great efforts to develop electrode materials with ultrafast gravimetric and volumetric Na-storage performance, due to difficult balance between Na-ion diffusion kinetics and pressing density of materials. In this work, Bi2Se3/graphene composites, synthesized by a selenization reaction, are investigated as anode materials for SIBs. Na-ion storage mechanism of Bi2Se3 should be attributed to a combined conversion-alloying one by a series of ex situ measurements. In the composites, Bi2Se3 particles with an average diameter of 100 nm are uniformly dispersed onto graphene with strong interfacial interaction. Despite their nanoscale size, the pressing density of Bi2Se3/graphene composite could still reach a high value of 2.07 g/cm3. Therefore, the composites can deliver a high gravimetric specific capacity of 346 mAh/g and volumetric specific capacity of 716 mAh/cm3 at a current density of 0.1 A/g. Remarkably, the composites exhibit an ultrafast Na-storage capability and a negligible capacity fading with the increasing of current density from 0.2 to 5 A/g. Even at 10 A/g (≈30 C), the composites still possess a gravimetric capacity of 183 mAh/g and volumetric capacity of 379 mAh/cm3 with ultrastable cyclability up to 1000 cycles.

        "abstract": "Crystalline Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) possess ordered accessible nano-channels. When these channels are decorated with redox-active functional groups, they can serve as the anode in metal ion batteries (LIB and SIB). Though sodium's superior relative abundance makes it a better choice over lithium, the energetically unfavourable intercalation of the larger sodium ion makes it incompatible with the commercial graphite anodes used in Li-ion batteries. Also, their sluggish movement inside the electrodes restricts the fast sodiation of SIB. Creating an electronic driving force at the electrodes via chemical manipulation can be a versatile approach to overcome this issue. Herein, we present anodes for SIB drawn on three isostructural COFs with nearly the same Highest Occupied Molecular Orbitals (HOMO) levels but with varying Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbitals (LUMO) energy levels. This variation in the LUMO levels has been deliberately obtained by the inclusion of electron-deficient centers (phenyl vs. tetrazine vs. bispyridine-tetrazine) substituents into the modules that make up the COF. With the reduction in the cell-potential, the electrons accumulate in the anti-bonding LUMO. Now, these electron-dosed LUMO levels become efficient anodes for attracting the otherwise sluggish sodium ions from the electrolyte. Also, the intrinsic porosity of the COF favors the lodging and diffusion of the Na+ ions. Cells made with these COFs achieve a high specific capacity (energy density) and rate performance (rapid charging-discharging), something that is not as easy for Na+ compared to the much smaller sized Li+. The bispyridine-tetrazine COF with the lowest LUMO energy shows a specific capacity of 340 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 and 128 mA h g-1 at a high current density of 15 A g-1. Only a 24% drop appears on increasing the current density from 0.1 to 1 A g-1, which is the lowest among all the top-performing COF derived Na-ion battery anodes.",

        "abstract": "Graphene incorporation should be one effective strategy to develop advanced electrode materials for a sodium-ion battery (SIB). Herein, the micro/nanostructural Sb/graphene composite (Sb-O-G) is successfully prepared with the uniform Sb nanospheres (∼100 nm) bound on the graphene via oxygen bonds. It is revealed that the in-situ-constructed oxygen bonds play a significant role on enhancing Na-storage properties, especially the ultrafast charge/discharge capability. The oxygen-bond-enhanced Sb-O-G composite can deliver a high capacity of 220 mAh/g at an ultrahigh current density of 12 A/g, which is obviously superior to the similar Sb/G composite (130 mAh/g at 10 A/g) just without Sb-O-C bonds. It also exhibits the highest Na-storage capacity compared to Sb/G and pure Sb nanoparticles as well as the best cycling performance. More importantly, this Sb-O-G anode achieves ultrafast (120 C) energy storage in SIB full cells, which have already been shown to power a 26-bulb array and calculator. All of these superior performances originate from the structural stability of Sb-O-C bonds during Na uptake/release, which has been verified by ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies and infrared spectroscopies.",

However, the use of MoS2 is limited by its low electronic conductivity, inferior cycling stability, and poor rate capability. To overcome these drawbacks, liquid-phase exfoliated graphene (LEGr) was used as the support, for which MoS2@LEGr heterostructures with a tunable loading amount of MoS2 were fabricated by a microwave-assisted solvothermal method. LEGr with its exceptional atomic structure not only serves as a robust structural support of MoS2 but also provides rapid electrical and ionic transfer pathways of the electrode material. When MoS2@LEGr heterostructures were applied for SIB anodes, the heterostructures exhibited a considerably enhanced sodium storage performance compared to pure MoS2, including higher sodium storage capacity as well as superior cycling stability and rate capability.",

        "abstract": "Electrode materials that can function well in both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are desirable for electrochemical energy storage applications, especially under high rate. In this work, a three-dimensional (3D) mesoporous γ-Fe2O3@carbon nanofiber (γ-Fe2O3@CNF) mat has been successfully synthesized by sol–gel based electrospinning and carbonization. It delivers a specific capacity of 820 mAh g−1 at 0.5 C after 250 cycles, 430 mAh g−1 at 6 C after 1000 cycles, and 222 mAh g−1 at ultrahigh rate of 60 C for LIBs, while for SIBs it delivers a specific capacity of 360 mAh g−1 at 1 C after 1000 cycles and 130 mAh g−1 at 60 C. Besides, the result of ex situ microstructure examination shows the polycrystalline nature of γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticle still exists in LIB even after 1000 cycles, while it vanishes in SIB, suggesting that the relatively larger volume expansion occurred during Na+ insertion/deinsertion, resulting in pulverization of the particles. The CNFs maintained their pristine 3D network structure after the charge/discharge, which demonstrated the critical role of a robust conductive electrode in promoting fast Li+/Na+ transportation. More importantly, they act as an electrical bridge between Li+/Na+ and γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles, therefore suppressing the cell impedance growth and γ-Fe2O3 volume expansion, resulting in the enhancement in both cyclic and rate capability.",

        "abstract": "High theoretical capacity and low-cost copper sulfide (CuxS)-based anodes have gained great attention for advanced sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, their practical application may be hindered due to their unstable cycling performance and problems with the dissolution of sodium sulfides (NaxS) into electrolyte. Here, we employed metal organic framework (MOF-199) as a sacrificial template to fabricate nanoporous CuxS with a large surface area embedded in the MOF-derived carbon network (CuxS-C) through a two-step process of sulfurization and carbonization via H2S gas-assisted plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) processing. Subsequently, we uniformly coated a nanocarbon layer on the Cu1.8S-C through hydrothermal and subsequent annealing processes. The physico-chemical properties of the nanocarbon layer were revealed by the analytical techniques of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We acquired a higher SIB performance (capacity retention (~93%) with a specific capacity of 372 mAh/g over 110 cycles) of the nanoporous Cu1.8S-C/C core/shell anode materials than that of pure Cu1.8S-C. This encouraging SIB performance is attributed to the key roles of a nanocarbon layer coated on the Cu1.8S-C to accommodate the volume variation of the Cu1.8S-C anode structure during cycling, enhance electrical conductivity and prevent the dissolution of NaxS into the electrolyte. With these physico-chemical and electrochemical properties, we ensure that the Cu1.8S-C/C structure will be a promising anode material for large-scale and advanced SIBs.",

Aiming at finding a new SIB anode material, we investigate the electrochemical properties of NaxTiO2 compounds with unprecedented penta-oxygen-coordinated trigonal bipyramid (TB) structures by using first-principles calculations. Identifying the four different TB phases, we perform the optimization of their crystal structures and calculate their energetics such as sodium binding energy, formation energy, electrode potential and activation energy for Na ion migration. The computations reveal that the TB-I phase is the best choice among the four TB phases for a SIB anode material due to a relatively low volume change of under 4% upon Na insertion, low electrode voltage under 1.0 V with a possibility of realizing the highest specific capacity of ∼335 mA h g-1 from full sodiation at x = 1, and reasonably low activation barriers under 0.35 eV at the Na content from x = 0.125 to x = 0.5. Through the analysis of electronic density of states and charge density difference upon sodiation, we find that the NaxTiO2 compounds in TB phases change from electron insulating to electron conducting materials due to the electron transfer from Na atoms to Ti ions, offering the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couple for SIB operation.",

To address these issues, the construction of （Molybdenum trioxide‐Molybdenum disulfide）MoO3‐MoS2 heterostructures has proven effective in enhancing electronic conductivity, ion diffusion properties, and structural stability. Guided by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which predict favorable Na+ diffusion and adsorption properties, nanorod‐like MoO3‐MoS2 heterostructures are synthesized using a two‐step method. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of the heterostructure and nanosized morphology, the resulting MoO3‐MoS2 electrode exhibits outstanding rate performance (316 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1) and long‐lasting cycling stability (286 mA h g−1 after 2300 cycles at 5 A g−1) as an SIB anode. In situ XRD measurements reveal that the ultrahigh specific capacity of MoO3‐MoS2 is attributed to the synergistic intercalation‐conversion storage of MoO3 and MoS2. In the pursuit of meeting commercialization requirements, electrodes with adjustable mass loading are also prepared using 3D printing, showcasing the high areal capacity characteristics of the SIBs.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as one of the most favorable alternative devices for sustainable development of modern society. However, it is still a big challenge to search for proper anode materials which have excellent cycling and rate performance. Here, zinc selenide microsphere and multiwalled carbon nanotube (ZnSe/MWCNT) composites are prepared via hydrothermal reaction and following grinding process. The performance of ZnSe/MWCNT composites as a SIB anode is studied for the first time. As a result, ZnSe/MWCNTs exhibit excellent rate capacity and superior cycling life. The capacity retains as high as 382 mA h g-1 after 180 cycles even at a current density of 0.5 A g-1. The initial Coulombic efficiency of ZnSe/MWCNTs can reach 88% and nearby 100% in the following cycles. The superior electrochemical properties are attributed to continuous electron transport pathway, improved electrical conductivity, and excellent stress relaxation.",

We herein report the synthesis of a nanohybrid of ultrasmall NiS2 nanoparticles embedded in porous carbon nanofibers (NiS2NP/p-CNF), which is implemented by an electrospinning process accompanied by further sulfide treatment. The highly dispersed NiS2 nanoparticles, coupled with the highly conductive porous nanofiber structure, endow the hybrids with favorable properties and structure for reducing the effects of volume expansion, providing a fast mass transport channel, and facilitating electron transfer. Systematic electrochemical studies verify that NiS2NP/p-CNF, when studied as an SIB anode, exhibits high performance with an excellent specific capacity (500 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1) and a competitive rate capability, maintaining 200 mA h g-1 at 2.0 A g-1, besides a long-term stability for 1000 cycles.

        "abstract": "It is still a challenging task to develop a facile and scalable process to synthesize porous hybrid materials with high electrochemical performance. Herein, a scalable strategy is developed for the synthesis of few-layer MoS2 incorporated into hierarchical porous carbon (MHPC) nanosheet composites as anode materials for both Li- (LIB) and Na-ion battery (SIB). An inexpensive oleylamine (OA) is introduced to not only serve as a hinder the stacking of MoS2 nanosheets but also to provide a conductive carbon, allowing large scale production. In addition, a SiO2 template is adopted to direct the growth of both carbon and MoS2 nanosheets, resulting in the formation of hierarchical porous structures with interconnected networks. Due to these unique features, the as-obtained MHPC shows substantial reversible capacity and very long cycling performance when used as an anode material for LIBs and SIBs, even at high current density. Indeed, this material delivers reversible capacities of 732 and 280 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles at 1 A g(-1) in LIBs and SIBs, respectively. The results suggest that these MHPC composites also have tremendous potential for applications in other fields.",

        "abstract": "Germanium is a promising sodium ion battery (NIB, NAB, SIB) anode material that is held back by its extremely sluggish kinetics and poor cyclability. We are the first to demonstrate that activation by a single lithiation-delithiation cycle leads to a dramatic improvement in the practically achievable capacity, in rate capability, and in cycling stability of Ge nanowires (GeNWs) and Ge thin film (GeTF). TEM and TOF-SIMS analysis shows that without activation, the initially single crystal GeNWs are effectively Na inactive, while the 100 nm amorphous GeTF sodiates only partially and inhomogeneously. Activation with Li induces amorphization in GeNWs reducing the barrier for nucleation of the NaxGe phase(s) and accelerates solid-state diffusion that aids the performance of both GeNWs and GeTF. Low rate (0.1C) Li activation also introduces a dense distribution of nanopores that lead to further improvements in the rate capability, which is ascribed to the lowered solid-state diffusion distances caused by the effective thinning of the Ge walls and by an additional Na diffusion path via the pore surfaces. The resultant kinetics are promising. Tested at 0.15C (1C = 369 mA/g, i.e. Na/Ge 1:1) for 50 cycles the GeNWs and GeTF maintain a reversible (desodiation) capacity of 346 and 418 mAh/g, respectively. They also demonstrate a capacity of 355 and 360 mAh/g at 1C and 284 and 310 mAh/g at 4C. Even at a very high rate of 10C the GeTF delivers 169 mAh/g.

Here, we present a self-template and in-situ synchronous selenization/vulcanization strategy for the synthesis of flowerlike hierarchical MoS0.74Se1.26/N-doped carbon (MoS0.74Se1.26/NC) microspheres by morphology-preserved thermal transformation of Mo-polydopamine precursor. Introducing element S into MoSe2 crystal structure can enhance the electron and ion transportation and lift the ability of MoSe2 to store Na+; the presence of Se can expand the interlayer spacing in contrast to MoS2. Moreover, carbon composition can also favor the electrical conductivity and the rigid micro/nanostructure is better for preventing the stacking of MoS0.74Se1.26 nanoflakes. The Mo-polydopamine-derived MoS0.74Se1.26/NC hybrid exhibits much better performance as the sodium-ion battery (SIB) anode than MoS2/NC and MoSe2/NC counterparts, confirming that the advanced electrode material can be attained via the rationalization of the synthetic method.

MoS2 generally presents a sheet-like structure based on its (002) lattice plane; however, such a structure tends to result in agglomeration and stacking of the sheets that cannot accommodate volume expansion, resulting in poor cyclability. Herein, grain-like MoS2 particulates (G-MoS2 ) are synthesized by sulfiding MoO3 in highly concentrated sulfur vapor, which results in epitaxial growth of MoS2 in (002), (100), and (110) lattice planes, with the product consisting of MoS2 particulates of about 300 nm coated with few-layered MoS2 nanosheets. The unique G-MoS2 architecture ensures good dispersion and sufficient distance to accommodate volume expansion during sodiation/desodiation, which effectively prevents stacking of MoS2 , maintaining structural stability. When employed as the working electrode for SIB, G-MoS2 delivers a high reversible capacity of 324 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 , retaining 312 mAh g-1 over 300 cycles with an average coulombic efficiency of 99.8 %. Even when G-MoS2 is cycled at a high current density (2.0 A g-1 ), the retained capacity is 175 mAh g-1 after 400 cycles.

Manufacturing rational structure is a crucial factor to achieve high-efficiency sodium storage for SIBs. In this study , nano Sn2S3 embedded in nitrogenous-carbon compounds (nano-Sn2S3 /C) is designed for SIB anode materials via a facile three-step strategy-precipitation, heat treatment and vulcanization with no templating agent. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that Sn2S3 displays a low Na+ diffusion energy barrier and the Sn-S bonds can be rebuilt during the sodiation/de-sodiation process. Notably, the electrochemical measurements coupled with ex-situ x-ray diffraction and ex-situ TEM are proposed to reveal the underlying Na+ storage mechanisms. Sn2S3 acts as a high-capacity composition, while the porous nitrogenous-carbon matrix serves as a rigid-conductive frame to accommodate the volume expansion and prevents the aggregation of nano Sn2S3 . The rationally generated architectures benefit greatly in rate capacity and structural stability. As expected, the as-prepared nano Sn2S3 /C exhibits remarkable rate capabilities with a specific of 603 and 160 mAh g-1 under typical conditions at 0.2 and 4 A g-1 , respectively.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been increasingly studied due to sodium (Na) being an inexpensive ionic resource (Na) and their battery chemistry being similar to that of current lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, SIBs have faced substantial challenges in developing high-performance anode materials that can reversibly store Na+ in the host structure. To address these challenges, molybdenum sulfide (MoS2)-based active materials have been considered as promising anodes, owing to the two-dimensional layered structure of MoS2 for stably (de)inserting Na+. Nevertheless, intrinsic issues of MoS2—such as low electronic conductivity and the loss of active S elements after a conversion reaction—have limited the viability of MoS2 in practical SIBs. Here, we report MoS2 embedded in carbon nanofibers encapsulated with a reduced graphene oxide (MoS2@CNFs@rGO) composite for SIB anodes. The MoS2@CNFs@rGO delivered a high capacity of 345.8 mAh g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 for 90 cycles. The CNFs and rGO were synergistically taken into account for providing rapid pathways for electrons and preventing the dissolution of S sources during repetitive conversion reactions. This work offers a new point of view to realize MoS2-based anode materials in practical SIBs.",

        "abstract": "To render the sodium ion battery (SIB) competitive among other technologies, the processes behind sodium storage in hard carbon anodes must be understood. For this purpose, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is usually undervalued, since fitting the spectra with equivalent circuit models requires an a priori knowledge about the system at hand. The analysis of the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) is an alternative, which refrains from fitting arbitrarily nested equivalent circuits. In this paper, the sodiation and desodiation of a hard carbon anode is studied by EIS at different states of charge (SOC). By reconstructing the DRT function, highly resolved information on the number and relative contribution of individual electrochemical processes is derived. During the sloping part of the sodiation curve, mass transport is found to be the most dominant source of resistance but rapidly diminishes when the plateau phase is reached. An equivalent circuit model qualitatively reproducing the experimental data of the sloping region was built upon the DRT results, which is particularly useful for future EIS studies on hard carbon SIB anodes. More importantly, this work contributes to establish EIS as a practical tool to directly study electrode processes without the bias of a previously assumed model.",

        "abstract": "Conversion-type anode materials possess high theoretical capacity for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to multielectron transmission (2-6 electrons). Mo-based chalcogenides are a class of great promise high-capacity host materials, but their development still undergoes serious volume changes and low transport kinetics during cycling process. Here, MoO2 nanoparticles anchored on N-doped carbon nanorod bundles (N-CNRBs/MoO2) are synthesized by a facile self-polymerized route and a following annealing. After hydrothermal sulfuration, N-CNRBs/MoO2 composites are encapsulated by surface growth of ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets, acquiring hierarchical N-CNRBs/MoO2@MoS2 composites. Served as SIB anode, N-CNRBs/MoO2@MoS2 electrode exhibits significantly improved sodium-ion storage properties. The reversible capacity is up to 554.4 mA h g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 and maintains 249.3 mA h g-1 even at 10.0 A g-1. During 5000 cycles, no obvious capacity decay is observed and the reversible capacities remain 334.8 mAh g-1 at 3.0 A g-1 and 301.4 mAh g-1 at 5.0 A g-1. These properties could be ascribed to the vertical encapsulation of MoS2 nanosheets on high-crystalline N-CNRBs/MoO2 substrates. The hierarchical architecture and unique heterostructure between MoO2 and MoS2 synergistically facilitate sodium-ion diffusion, relieve volume changes and boost pseudocapacitive charge storage of N-CNRBs/MoO2@MoS2 electrode. Therefore, the rational growth of nanosheets on complex substrates shows promising potential to construct anode materials for high-performance batteries.",

In the corresponding SIBs, the measured reversible capacity was 750 mA h g-1 (after 200 cycles), which is lower than that of Na3As. Extensive first-principles calculations were performed employing a structure prediction method for crystalline LixAs and NaxAs (x = 1-6) phases, as well as ab initio molecular dynamics simulations for their amorphous phases. In good agreement with the experimental LIB data, our calculations successfully predict the discharge capacity versus voltage curves, showing that the capacity of the amorphous phase reaches up to that of Li4As. In contrast, the SIB exhibited difficulty in reaching the predicted capacity (x = 3.5), probably due to significant volume expansion. Comparison of the theoretical discharge curves with the experimental data provides valuable information for the development of high-performance LIBs and SIBs.",

The size of the TiO2 particles is controlled to ∼35-40 nm, with almost even distribution on the MWCNTs surface. The nanostructuring and appropriate doping of cost-effective manganese into the TiO2 host improved the electrochemical performance in terms of high rate capability and specific capacity for both the rechargeable battery systems. For the LIBs, the charge capacity of the 5% Mn-TiO2/MWCNT anode is 226.3 mA h g-1 in the first cycle, and is retained at 176.4 mA h g-1 after 80 cycles as compared with the SIBs, in which the charge capacity is 152.1 mA h g-1 in the first cycle, and is retained at 121.4 mA h g-1 after 80 cycles. After testing the electrodes at a high current rate of 20C, the nanocomposite electrode can still demonstrate charge capacities of 131.2 and 117.2 mA h g-1 at a 0.1C rate for LIBs and SIBs, respectively. The incorporation of Mn-ions (2+, 4+) is found to play a crucial role in terms of defects and vacancy creation, increasing conduction band electrons and lattice expansion to facilitate alkali metal ion diffusion for superior electrochemical performance. The combination of heteroatom doping and use of a highly conductive additive in the form of MWCNTs has resulted in excellent electrode integrity, high ion accessibility, and fast electron transport. Its outstanding cycling stability and remarkable rate performance make the 5% Mn-TiO2/MWCNT a promising anode material for high-performance LIBs and SIBs.",

Herein, we have reported gallium sulfide (Ga2S3) as a novel SIB anode material for the first time. Ga2S3 nanorods have been synthesized via the facile hydrothermal preparation of a GaOOH precursor with subsequent H2S annealing. Mixed with graphene upon electrode preparation, this Ga2S3 electrode maintains a reversible specific capacity of 476 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.4 A g-1, with a coulombic efficiency of over 99%. Ex situ XRD analysis and theoretical calculations are employed to comprehensively elucidate the detailed sodium ion storage mechanism of Ga2S3, which is composed of initial Na+ intercalation, a subsequent multi-step conversion reaction between S and Na+, and an eventual alloying reaction between Ga and Na+ with the end product of Na7Ga13. Further kinetics analysis has demonstrated that the conversion reaction is the rate-limiting step due to a multi-step reaction with the intermediate phase of GaS. Moreover, the appearance of liquid metal Ga, as confirmed via TEM observations and theoretical calculations, can serve as a self-healing agent that repairs cracks in the electrode. Our findings shed light on the further design of Ga-based materials, and they also can be extended to solid-state-battery systems.",

In this work, we propose to use the 2D hybrid composites of SnS2 with graphene or graphene oxide (GO) layers as the SIB anode, based on the first-principles calculations of their atomic structures, sodium intercalation energetics, and electronic properties. The calculations reveal that a graphene or GO film can effectively support not only the stable formation of a heterointerface with the SnS2 layer but also the easy intercalation of a sodium atom with low migration energy and acceptable low volume change. The electronic charge-density differences and the local density of states indicate that the electrons are transferred from the graphene or GO layer to the SnS2 layer, facilitating the formation of a heterointerface and improving the electronic conductance of the semiconducting SnS2 layer. These 2D hybrid composites of SnS2/G or GO are concluded to be more promising candidates for SIB anodes compared with the individual monolayers.",

Given the larger radius of Na+ (1.02 Å) than Li+ (0.76 Å), it was generally believed that the Sb anode would experience even worse capacity degradation in SIBs due to more substantial volumetric variations during cycling when compared to LIBs. However, the Sb anode in SIBs unexpectedly exhibited both better electrochemical and structural stability than in LIBs, and the mechanistic reasons that underlie this performance discrepancy remain undiscovered. Here, using substantial in situ transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman techniques complemented by theoretical simulations, we explicitly reveal that compared to lithiation/delithiation process, sodiation/desodiation process of Sb anode displays a previously unexplored two-stage alloying/dealloying mechanism with polycrystalline and amorphous phases as the intermediates featuring improved resilience to mechanical damage, contributing to superior cycling stability in SIBs. Additionally, the better mechanical properties and weaker atomic interaction of Na-Sb alloys than Li-Sb alloys favor enabling mitigated mechanical stress, accounting for enhanced structural stability as unveiled by theoretical simulations.

As an anode for SIBs, Ni‐NPC exhibits far superior initial Coulombic efficiency, reversible specific capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability to N, P co‐doped hard carbon. Combining in situ EIS and ex‐situ XPS,this study reveals that Ni‐single atoms modulate the composition of the solid electrolyte interface layer, thereby improving the cycling stability of Ni‐NPC. Theoretical calculation and kinetics analysis suggest that Ni‐single atoms are the promoters of the diffusion of Na+. Furthermore, with the aid of systematic in situ characterizations, the structural evolution of Ni‐NPC at different sodium storage stages is identified.

For SIBs, antimony (Sb) shows potential as anode material but is impeded by the high volumetric variations. Here the challenges of Sb sodium storage by introducing the nanostructured Cu substrate for enhanced Sb adhesion and morphology optimization is addressed, which is realized by fused deposition modeling (FDM) printing of Cu substrate, subsequent high‐temperature sintering, and electrodeposition of Sb. In SIBs, the Sb deposited on three dimensional (3D) printed Cu substrate performs improved cycling stability compared with that of Sb@Cu with commercial Cu foil substrate, which can be attributed to the nanostructure of the 3D‐Cu substrate. Such architecture of 3D‐Cu induces the generation of pine‐leaf‐like Sb clusters to promote stability and kinetics, and it aids the adhesion between the Sb cluster and 3D‐Cu substrate for preventing the Sb detachment and restructuring the Sb cluster to the robust porous ligament‐channel Sb framework. The morphology evolution, (de)sodiation mechanism, and gas evolution are explored by ex situ scanning electron microscope, operando X‐ray diffraction, and operando differential electrochemical mass spectrometry separately.

We simulate the volume-expansion-resistant mechanism of Bi during the (de)alloying reaction and unveil that the irreversible phase transition upon (de)alloying underlies the fundamental origin for the structural degradation of Bi anode, while a proper compressive stress (~10%) raised by the bulk carbon can trigger a \"domino-like\" Bi crystal recovering. Consequently, the as obtained BiNC exhibits a record high volumetric capacity (823.1 mAh cm-3 for SIBs, 848.1 mAh cm-3 for PIBs) and initial coulombic efficiency (95.3% for SIBs, 96.4% for PIBs), and unprecedented cycling stability (15000 cycles for SIBs with only 0.0015% degradation per cycle), outperforming the state-of-the-art literature. This work provides new insights on the undesirable structural evolution and proposes basic guidelines for design of the anti-degradation structure for alloy-type electrode materials.",

However, the rational construction of heterogeneous composite with abundant heterogeneous interfaces for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is still a significant challenge. Herein, inspired by density functional theory calculations, interface engineering can greatly decrease the energy bandgap and migration barrier of Na ions in Sb and Na3Sb phases, as well as enhance the mechanical properties. A porous heterointerface MOFC–Sb is fabricated by utilizing MOF-C as a support and buffer, exhibiting excellent electrochemical performances for sodium storage. The MOF-C–Sb anode with its rich heterointerface presents an improved electrochemical performance of 540.5 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1, and 515.9 mAh g−1 at 1.6 A g−1 in term of sodium storage, efficiently resolving the serious volume expansion issues of metal Sb.

In particular, the authors demonstrate that uniform surface modiﬁcation can eﬀectively facilitate electron and sodium transport kinetics, conﬁne alloy pulverization, and simultaneously synergize interactions with the ether-based electrolyte to form a robust organic-inorganic SEI. Moreover, it is discovered that the diethylene glycol dimethyl ether electrolyte with strong stability and an optimized Na + solvation structure can co-embed the carbon layer to achieve fast reaction kinetics. Consequently, Sn@NC anodes deliver extra-long cycling stability of more than 10 000 cycles.

        "abstract": "Hard carbons (HCs) are extensively investigated as the potential anodes for commercialization of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the practical deployment of HC anode suffers from the retarded Na+ diffusion at the high-rate or low-temperature operation scenarios. Herein, a multiscale modification strategy by tuning HC microstructure on the particle level as well as replenishing extra Na+ reservoir for the electrode through a homogeneous presodiation therapy is presented. Consequently, the coulombic efficiency of HC anode can be precisely controlled till the close-to-unit value. Detailed kinetics analysis observes that the Na+ diffusivity can be drastically enhanced by two orders of magnitude at the low potential region (< 0.1 V vs. Na+ /Na), which accelerates the rate-limiting step. As pairing the presodiated HC anode (≈5.0 ± 0.2 mg cm-2 ) with the NaVPO4 F cathode (≈10.3 mg cm-2 ) in the 200 mAh pouch cell, the optimal balance of the cyclability (83% over 1000 cycles), low-temperature behavior till -40 °C as well as the maximized power output of 1500 W kg-1 can be simultaneously achieved.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are promising candidates for large-scale energy storage due to the abundance and low cost of sodium. However, graphite, the primary anode for commercial lithium-ion batteries, cannot be applied to SIBs. Its two-dimensional (2D) counterpart graphene is also inactive toward Na ions because of the delocalized π-electron network. We propose an idea to tackle this problem by introducing kagome topology into the honeycomb lattice, creating localized electronic states for improving the Na storage performance. Herein, we design a form of 2D carbon allotrope (named FSL-graphene), consisting of a kagome and a honeycomb sublattice. It has excellent stability, which is confirmed by the superior cohesive energy, positive phonon modes, high thermal stability, and strong mechanical stability. FSL-graphene exhibits an ultra-high theoretical Na storage capacity of 3347.1 mA h g−1, superior to most previously reported 2D anode materials. In addition, it possesses low diffusion energy barriers (0.19–0.23 eV), low open-circuit voltages (0.59–0.61 V), and small changes in lattice constants (1.3%). Furthermore, the electrolytes with high dielectric constants (e.g., ethylene carbonate) could improve the adsorption and migration of Na on FSL-graphene. This study provides an insight for designing high-performance carbon anode materials for SIBs by focusing on the topological lattices.",

Herein, a functional electrolyte containing 1.0 m NaCF3 SO3 in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME) (1.0 m NaCF3 SO3 -DEGDME) is developed, which can be readily used for NiCo2 S4 anode with high initial coulomb efficiency (96.2%), enhanced cycling performance, and boosted capacities (341.7 mA h g-1 after 250 continuous cycles at the current density of 200 mA g-1 ). The electrochemical tests and related phase characterization combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicate the ether-based electrolyte is more suitable for the NiCo2 S4 anode in SIBs due to the formation of a stable electrode-electrolyte interface. Additionally, the importance of the voltage window is also demonstrated to further optimize the electrochemical performance of the NiCo2 S4 electrode.

        "abstract": "Allotrope metal structures composed of carbon as anode materials for metal-ion batteries are a current research hotspot. In this work, the recently synthesized graphene allotrope, two-dimensional (2D) biphenylene, consisting of tetragonal, hexagonal and octagonal carbon rings, was explored theoretically. Our first-principles calculations verified that 2D biphenylene has dynamical, mechanical and thermal stability and exhibits metallic features. Its novel structure can provide multiple adsorption sites for Na ions, a fast charge-discharge rate (low Na migration barriers of <0.2 eV) and high theoretical capacity (1075.37 mA h g-1). These superior properties, combined with its carbon abundance and light mass, make the biphenylene monolayer a promising high-performance anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs).",

        "abstract": "The natural insulating property and notorious pulverization of volume variation-induced materials during cycling pares the electrochemical activity of red phosphorous (RP) for lithium/sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs). To work out these issues, a tailored trimodal porous carbon support comprising highly ordered macropores and micro-mesoporous walls embedded with copper (Cu) nanoclusters (Cu-OMC) is proposed to confine RP. The construction of highly conductive copper-carbon wall facilitates fast electrons and ions transportation, while the interconnected and ordered porous structure not only creates enough space to resist the expansion effect of RP but also minimizes the ion diffusion length and enhances ion accessibility (the ion migration coefficient is ten times that of disordered porous carbon). Consequently, the resulting Cu-OMC@RP anode delivers a high reversible capacity (2498.7 mAh g-1 at 0.3 C for LIBs; 2454.2 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C for SIBs), superb rate properties (824.7 mAh g-1 at 10 C for LIBs; 774.2 mAh g-1 at 5 C for SIBs), and outstanding cycling stability (an ultralow decay rate of 0.057% per cycle after 1000 cycles at 10 C for LIBs and 0.048% per cycle at 5 C over 500 cycles for SIBs).",

The nanocomposite exhibits a reversible capacity of 619.2 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 with a coulombic efficiency over 99.5% after 1000 cycles when used as a LIB anode. The nanocomposite also exhibits superior sodium storage performance (267 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 , capacity retention of 65.4% after 1000 cycles at 200 mA g-1 ). The TiO2 shell serves as a strong conformal layer and soft matrix that can tolerate the volume expansion and maintain the structural integrity of the anode during discharging and charging. Moreover, the open active diffusion channels of the shell contribute to high ion diffusivity and improved ionic, and electronic diffusion.

As well, carbonaceous materials, as a crucial additive, can effectively ameliorate the ion/electron conductivity of integrated composites, realizing the fast ion transport and charge transfer. Here, motivated by the enhancement effect of carbon and heterojunction on conductivity, it is proposed that the CoSe2 /WSe2 heterojunction as inner core is coated by carbon outer shell and uniformly embedded in porous carbon nanosheets (denoted as CoSe2 /WSe2 @C/CNs), which is used as anode material for SIBs. Combining with density functional theoretical calculations, it is confirmed that the structure of heterojunction can introduce built-in electric-field, which can accelerate the transportation of Na+ and improve the conductivity of electrons. Moreover, the introduction of porous carbon nanosheets (CNs) can provide a channel for the transportation of Na+ and avoid the volume expansion during Na+ insertion and extraction process. As it is expected, CoSe2 /WSe2 @C/CNs anode displays ultrastable specific capacity of 501.9 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 over 200 cycles, and ultrahigh rate capacity of 625 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles.",

        "abstract": "The enhancement of the structural stability of conversion-based metal sulfides at high current densities remains a major challenge in realizing the practical application of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The instability of metal sulfides is caused by the large volume variation and sluggish reaction kinetics upon sodiation/desodiation. To overcome this, herein, a heterostructured nanocube anode composed of CuS/FeS2 embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon (CuS/FeS2 @NC) is synthesized. Size- and shape-controlled porous carbon nanocubes containing metallic nanoparticles are synthesized by the two-step pyrolysis of a bimetallic Prussian blue analog (PBA) precursor. The simple sulfurization-induced formation of highly conductive CuS along with FeS2 facilitates sodium-ion diffusion and enhances the redox reversibility upon cycling. The mesoporous carbon structure provides excellent electrolyte impregnation, efficient charge transport pathways, and good volume expansion buffering. The CuS/FeS2 @NC nanocube anode exhibits excellent sodium storage characteristics including high desodiation capacity (608 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 ), remarkable long-term cycle life (99.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 5 A g-1 ), and good rate capability up to 5 A g-1 .

To obtain a deeper understanding of the Na-storage mechanism, we comparatively investigated electrochemical behaviors of HC and graphite for Na- and Li-storage reactions. The experimental results reveal that the Na-storage reaction on HC at a low-potential plateau proceeds in a manner similar to the Li+-insertion reaction on graphite but very differently from the Li+-storage process on HC, suggesting that the Na-storage mechanism of HC at a low-voltage plateau operates through the Na+ intercalation into the graphitic layers for the formation of sodium-graphite intercalation compounds (Na-GICs) and is consistent with the \"adsorption-intercalation\" mechanism.

        "abstract": "The pseudo‐layered sulfide NiCr2S4 exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance as anode material in sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). The Na storage mechanism is investigated by synchrotron‐based X‐ray scattering and absorption techniques as well as by electrochemical measurements. A very high reversible capacity in the 500th cycle of 489 mAh g−1 is observed at 2.0 A g−1 in the potential window 3.0–0.1 V. Full discharge includes irreversible generation of Ni0 and Cr0 nanoparticles embedded in nanocrystalline Na2S yielding shortened diffusion lengths and predominantly surface‐controlled charge storage. During charge, Ni0 and Cr0 are oxidized, Na2S is consumed, and amorphous Ni and Cr sulfides are formed. Limiting the potential window to 3.0–0.3 V an unusual nickel extrusion sodium insertion mechanism occurs: Ni2+ is reduced to nanosized Ni0 domains, expelled from the host lattice, and is replaced by Na+ cations to form O3‐type like NaCrS2. Surprisingly, the discharge and charge processes comprise Na+ shuttling between highly crystalline NiCr2S4 and NaCrS2 enabling a superior long‐term stability for 3000 cycles. The results not only provide valuable insights for the electrochemistry of conversion materials but also extend the scope of layered electrode materials considering the reversible nickel extrusion sodium insertion reaction as new concept for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), being an attractive candidate of lithium-ion batteries, have attracted widespread attention as a result of sufficient sodium resource with low price and their comparable suitability in the field of energy storage. However, one of the main challenges for their wide-scale application is to develop suitable anode materials with excellent electrochemical performance. Herein, a novel orderly layered VMoS2 (OL-VMS) anode material was synthesized through a facile hydrothermal self-assembly approach followed by a heating procedure. As the anode material of the SIBs, the unique structure of OL-VMS not only facilitated the rapid migration of sodium ions between the stacked layers but also provided a stable framework for the volume change in the process of intercalation/deintercalation. In addition, vanadium mediating in the framework caused more defects to produce abundant storage sites for Na+. As such, the obtained OL-VMS-based anode exhibited high reversible capacities of 602.9 mAh g-1 at 0.2 mA g-1 and 534 mAh g-1 even after 190-cycle operation at 2 A g-1. Furthermore, the OL-VMS-based anode delivered an outstanding specific capacity of 626.4 mAh g-1 after 100-cycle testing at 2 A g-1 in a voltage range from 0.01 to 3 V. In particular, even in the absence of conductive carbon, it still showed an excellent specific capacity of 260 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 130 cycles in a 0.3-3 V voltage range, which should contribute to the cost reduction and energy density increase.",

Here, new types of biomass-derived hard carbons were obtained via one-step carbonization of lotus seedpods at 1000-1400 °C, respectively. The control of carbonization temperature proved to be significant in controlling the lattice characterization of lotus seedpod-derived hard carbon. Higher temperature generally promoted the lattice graphitization and thus generated a more narrowed d-interlayer space with limited pore volume. The hard carbon pyrolyzed at 1200 °C achieved an optimized reversible capacity of 328.8 mAh g-1 and exhibited a remarkable capacity retention of 90% after 200 cycles. In addition, such a biomass-derived hard carbon presented improved cyclic stability and rate performance, revealing capacity of 330.6, 288.9, 216.9, 116.5, and 78.3 mAh g-1 at 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 mA g-1, respectively. Intrinsically, high pyrolysis temperature (1400 °C) gave rise to more narrowed carbon lattice and reduced pore volume and, thus, failed to accommodate sodium ions either from the intercalation into lattice or the ion adsorption onto the pore surface. Such combined advantages of lotus seedpod-derived hard carbon, including the abundance, sufficiently adequate reversible capacity, and prominent cycling and rate property allowed for its large-scale application as promising anode material for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted great interest for large‐scale electric energy storage in recent years. However, anodes with long cycle life and large reversible capacities are still lacking and therefore limiting the development of SIBs. Here, a bulk Bi anode with surprisingly high Na storage performance in combination with glyme‐based electrolytes is reported. This study shows that the bulk Bi electrode is gradually developed into a porous integrity during initial cycling, which is totally different from that in carbonate‐based electrolytes and ensures facile Na+ transport and structural stability. The achievable capacity of bulk Bi in the NaPF6‐diglyme electrolyte is high up to 400 mAh g−1, and the capacity retention is 94.4% after 2000 cycles, corresponding to a capacity loss of 0.0028% per cycle. It exhibits two flat discharge/charge plateaus at 0.67/0.77 and 0.46/0.64 V, ascribed to the typical two‐phase reactions of Bi ↔ NaBi and NaBi ↔ Na3Bi, respectively. The excellent performance is attributed to the unique porous integrity, stable solid electrolyte interface, and good electrode wettability of glymes. This interplay between electrolyte and electrode to boost Na storage performance will pave a new pathway for high‐performance SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Alkali metal (Li, Na, and K) ion batteries are vital in portable and large-scale stationary energy storage. Recently, organic anodes have attracted increasing attention for alkali metal ion batteries due to their chemical diversity and potential high capacity. In this work, we discovered that cyclized polyacrylonitrile (cPAN) can serve as a superior anode for alkali metal ion batteries. Remarkably, upon activation cycling, as an anode of lithium-ion battery, cPAN exhibits a reversible capacity as high as 1238 mAh g-1 under a current density of 50 mA g-1. Based on electrochemical experiments and first-principles calculations, it is demonstrated that the hexagonal carbon ring, piperidine ring, and pyridine nitrogen in ladder cPAN are the main active sites for lithium-ion storage. In addition, we show that cPAN displays a unique potential-dependent solid electrolyte interphase formation from 0.1 to 0.01 V vs. Li/Li+. Furthermore, cPAN displays decent performance as an anode in SIBs and PIBs. The discovery of cPAN anode could pave the way for the future development of organic anodes for alkali metal ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "It is of fundamental and technological significance to develop dual‐role anode materials for both lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) with high performance. Here, a composite material based on CoSe2 nanoparticles encapsulated in N‐doped carbon framework intertwined with carbon nanotubes (CoSe2@N‐CF/CNTs) is prepared successfully from cobalt‐based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF‐67). As anode materials for LIBs, CoSe2@N‐CF/CNTs composites deliver a reversible capacity of 428 mAh g−1 even after 500 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1 with almost 100% Coulombic efficiency. The charge and discharge mechanisms of CoSe2 are characterized using ex situ X‐ray diffraction and Raman analysis, from which the lithiation products of CoSe2 are found to be LixCoSe2 and Li2Se, which are further converted to CoSe2 upon delithiation. The CoSe2@N‐CF/CNTs composites also demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance as anode materials for SIBs with a carbonate‐based electrolyte, with specific capacities of 606 and 501 mAh g−1 at 0.1 and 1 A g−1 in the 100th cycle. The electrochemical performance of the anode materials is further studied by pseudocapacitance and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurements. This work may be exploited for the rational design and development of dual‐role anode materials for both Li‐ and Na‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal chalcogenides have received great attention as promising anode candidates for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the undesirable cyclic life and inferior rate capability still restrict their practical applications. The design of micro-nano hierarchitectures is considered as a possible strategy to facilitate the electrochemical reaction kinetics and strengthen the electrode structure stability upon repeated Na+ insertion/extraction. Herein, urchin-like Fe3 Se4 hierarchitectures are successfully prepared and developed as a novel anode material for SIBs. Impressively, the as-prepared urchin-like Fe3 Se4 can present an ultrahigh rate capacity of 200.2 mAh g-1 at 30 A g-1 and a prominent capacity retention of 99.9% over 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1 , meanwhile, a respectable initial coulombic efficiency of ≈100% is achieved. Through the conjunct study of in situ X-ray diffraction, ex situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy, as well as cyclic voltammetry curves, it is intriguing to reveal that the phase transformation from monoclinic to amorphous structure accompanied by the pseudocapacitive Na+ storage behavior accounts for the superior electrochemical performance.

        "abstract": "Incorporation of N,S‐codoped nanotube‐like carbon (N,S‐NTC) can endow electrode materials with superior electrochemical properties owing to the unique nanoarchitecture and improved kinetics. Herein, α‐MnS nanoparticles (NPs) are in situ encapsulated into N,S‐NTC, preparing an advanced anode material (α‐MnS@N,S‐NTC) for lithium‐ion/sodium‐ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs). It is for the first time revealed that electrochemical α → β phase transition of MnS NPs during the 1st cycle effectively promotes Li‐storage properties, which is deduced by the studies of ex situ X‐ray diffraction/high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy and electrode kinetics. As a result, the optimized α‐MnS@N,S‐NTC electrode delivers a high Li‐storage capacity (1415 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1), excellent rate capability (430 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1), and long‐term cycling stability (no obvious capacity decay over 5000 cycles at 1 A g−1) with retained morphology. In addition, the N,S‐NTC‐based encapsulation plays the key roles on enhancing the electrochemical properties due to its high conductivity and unique 1D nanoarchitecture with excellent protective effects to active MnS NPs. Furthermore, α‐MnS@N,S‐NTC also delivers high Na‐storage capacity (536 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1) without the occurrence of such α → β phase transition and excellent full‐cell performances as coupling with commercial LiFePO4 and LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cathodes in LIBs as well as Na3V2(PO4)2O2F cathode in SIBs.",

One of the key obstacles to sodium batteries is the lack of efficient and stable anode materials. Compared with traditional inorganic electrode materials, organic materials are more attractive because of their easier sodium transport accessibility and the diversities of organic frameworks and functional groups. In this work, two molecules (Na-CPN and Na-CPP) were synthesized and used as anode materials for SIBs. Structurally, the two compounds are isomers, and they are distinguished by the position of N atoms in phenylpyridine. Na-CPP provides a high reversible capacity of 197 mAh g -1 , excitingly, its capacity could maintain 99.1% even after 350 cycles of 100 mA g -1 . Moreover, after going through 1200 cycles at a current density of 5C, the Na-CPP electrode still retain a capacity rate of 89.9%. These results are impressive. In contrast, Na-CPN exhibited inferior capacity performance and rate performance for its larger polarization, particle size and charge transporting resistance.",

Herein, an ultra-stable TiP2O7 with enriched oxygen vacancies is prepared as SIBs/PIBs anode through P-containing polymer mediation carbonization, which avoids harsh reduction atmospheres or expensive facilities. The introduction of oxygen vacancies effectively increase pseudocapacitance, diffusivity coefficient and lower the Na insertion energy barrier.

        "abstract": "In response to the increasing concern for energy management, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been extensively researched as an attractive anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The proficient cycling durability and good rate performance of SIBs are the two key parameters that determine their potential for practical use. In this study, nature-inspired three-dimensional (3D) MoS2 ultrathin marigold flower-like microstructures were prepared by a controlled hydrothermal method. These microscale flowers are constructed by arbitrarily arranged but closely interconnected two-dimensional ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets. The as-prepared MoS2 microflowers (MFs) have then been chemically wrapped by layered graphene sheets to form the bonded 3D hybrid MoS2-G networks. TEM, SEM, XRD, XPS, and Raman characterizations were used to study the morphology, crystallization, chemical compositions, and wrapping contact between MoS2 and graphene. The ultrathin nature of MoS2 in 3D MFs and graphene wrapping provide strong electrical conductive channels and conductive networks in an electrode. Benefitting from the 2 nm ultrathin crystalline MoS2 sheets, chemically bonded graphene, defect-induced sodium storage active sites, and 3D interstitial spaces, the prepared electrode exhibited an outstanding specific capacity (606 mA h g-1 at 200 mA g-1), remarkable rate performance (345 mA h g-1 at 1600 mA g-1), and long cycle life (over 100 cycles with tremendous Coulombic efficiencies beyond 100%).

        "abstract": "Manganese-based chalcogenides would be of latent capacity in serving as anodes for assembling lithium- and/or sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs) due to their large theoretical capacity, low price, and low-toxicity functionality, while the low electroconductivity and easy agglomeration behavior may impede their technical applications. Here, a solid-state solution of MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes in rock-salt phase has been synthesized for the first time at a relatively low temperature from the precursors of Mn(II) acetylacetonate with dibenzyl dichalcogens in oleylamine with octadecene, and the MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes have been assembled with N-doped graphene to form a new kind of heterostructured nanohybrids (shortened as MnS0.5Se0.5/N-G hybrids), which are very potential for the fabrication of metal-ion batteries including LIBs and/or SIBs. Investigations revealed that there have been dense vacancies generated and active sites increased via nonequilibrium alloying of MnS and MnSe into the solid-solution MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes with segregation and defects achieved in the low-temperature solution synthetic route. Meanwhile, the introduction of N-doped graphene forming heterojunction interfaces between MnS0.5Se0.5 and N-doped graphene would efficiently enhance their electroconductivity and avoid agglomeration of the active MnS0.5Se0.5 nanocubes with considerably improved electrochemical properties. As a result, the MnS0.5Se0.5/N-G hybrids delivered superior Li/Na storage capacities with outstanding rate performance as well as satisfactorily lasting stability (1039/457 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 for LIBs/SIBs).

        "abstract": "Transition metal selenides (TMSs) are suitable for SIBs and PIBs owing to their satisfactory theoretical capacity and superior electrical conductivity. However, the large radius of Na+/K+ easily leads to sluggish kinetics and poor conductivity, which hinder the development of SIBs and PIBs. Structure design is an effective method to solve these obstacles. In this study, Co2+ ions combined with glycerol molecules to form self-assembled nanospheres at first, and then they were in situ converted into CoSe2 nanoparticles embedded in a carbon matrix during the selenization process. This structure has three-dimensional ion diffusion channels that can effectively hamper the aggregation of metal compound nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the CoSe2/C of the yolk-shell structure and a large number of pores help alleviate volume expansion and facilitate electrolyte wettability. These structural advantages of CoSe2/C endow it with remarkable electrochemical performances for full/half SIBs and full/half PIBs. The obtained CoSe2/C exhibits superior stability and excellent performance (312.1 mA h g-1 at 4 A g-1 after 1600 cycles) for SIBs. When it is used as an anode material for PIBs, 369.2 mA h g-1 can be retained after 200 cycles at 50 mA g-1 and 248.1 mA h g-1 can be retained after 200 cycles at 500 mA g-1; in addition, CoSe2/C also shows superior rate capacity (186.4 mA h g-1 at 1000 mA g-1). A series of ex situ XRD measurements were adapted to explore the possible conversion mechanism of CoSe2/C as the anode for PIBs. It is worth noting that the full-cell of CoSe2/C//Na3V2(PO4)3@rGO for SIBs and the full-cell of CoSe2/C//PTCDA-450 for PIBs were successfully assembled. The relationship between the structure and performance of CoSe2/C was investigated through density functional theory (DFT).",

In addition, the (NH4)2Mo3S13 electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance at low temperatures (0 °C). The mechanism of Na+ storage in (NH4)2Mo3S13 can be innovatively revealed through the combined use of electrochemical kinetic analysis and a series of ex situ characterization tests.

        "abstract": "There is an ever‐increasing demand for rechargeable batteries with fast charging, long cycling, high safety, and low cost in new energy storage systems. Herein, a heterogeneous architecture composed of MoS2‐coupled carbon nanosheets encapsulated on sodium titanate nanowires is developed and demonstrated as an advanced anode for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Owing to the synergistic effects of ultrastable substrate of 1D sodium titanate (NTO) nanowires, high‐capacity promoter of 2D MoS2 nanosheets as well as the 2D conductive carbon matrix, the resulting 1D/2D–2D hybrid demonstrates excellent high‐rate capacity and super‐durable cyclability, delivering a stable capacity of up to 425.5 mAh g−1 at 200 mA g−1. Even at an ultrafast charging/discharging process within 80 s, the capacity can be maintained at 201 mAh g−1 after 16 000 cycles with only 0.0012% capacity loss per cycle, one of the best high‐rate capacities and cyclabilities for NTO‐based hybrid composites. The present work highlights the designing protocol of hierarchical nanoarchitectures with stable substrate and high‐capacity electrodes for next‐generation energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "Pyrite (FeS2) has been considered as one of the most potential anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) due to its low cost, environmentally friendly features and high theoretical capacity. However, the huge volume changes during a charge/discharge process and poor conductivity of FeS2 hindered its practical applications. Herein, we propose a facile scalable approach to prepare nanostructured FeS2 embedded in an N-doped carbon nanosheet composite (FeS2/CNS) via a combined template method and a solid state sulfuration method. N-Doped carbon nanosheets are believed to alleviate the volume variation and enhance the conductivity of an electrode, and the nanoscale particle size with an average diameter of 50-80 nm can shorten the ion-diffusion paths during a sodiation/desodiation process. As a result, the FeS2/CNS electrode exhibits high specific capacity (812 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), long cycling life (77.2% capacity retention after 350 cycles at 1 A g-1) and excellent rate capability (400 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1) when tested as an anode material for SIBs. The results demonstrate the potential applications of FeS2/CNS in SIBs with low-cost, high power density and long cycling life.",

The effects on the diffusion barriers (Eb ) and adsorption energies (Ead ) of Li/Na atoms in NGY are also studied and imine-N is demonstrated to be the ideal doping format to enhance the Li/Na storage performance. Besides, the Li/Na adsorption routes in NGY are optimized according to the experimental and the first-principles calculation results.

        "abstract": "A comprehensive study is conducted on hard carbon (HC) series samples by tuning the graphitic local microstructures systematically as an anode for SIBs in both carbonate- (CBE) and glyme-based electrolytes (GBE). The results reveal more detailed charge storage characters of HCs on the LVP section. 1) The LVP capacity is closely related to the prismatic surface area to the basal plane as well as the bulk density, regardless of electrolyte systems. 2) The glyme-sodium ion complex can facilitate sodium ion delivery into the internal closed pores of the HCs along with not well-ordered graphitic structures. 3) The glyme-mediated sodium ion-storage behavior causes significant decreases in both surface film resistance and charge transfer resistance, leading to enhanced rate capability. 4) The LVP originates from the formation of pseudo-metallic sodium nanoclusters, which are the same in a CBE and GBE. These results provide insight into the sodium ion-storage behaviors of HCs, particularly on the interrelationship between graphitic local microstructures and electrolyte systems.

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) has become one of the prospective anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), but its application suffers from the low electron conductivity and poor ion diffusion kinetics. In this study, melting & evaporation process of neutral salt was first introduced to produce nitrogen-rich interpenetrated porous HC (NIP-HC) as anode for SIBs. Such protocol allows for the first-demonstrated porous structure for HC materials with desired electronic conductivity and much improved rate performance than that conventional porous structure. As a result, high reversible capacity (358 mAh g-1) and enhanced rate property (239.8 mAh g-1 at 2 A g-1) are achieved with improved electrode kinetics and electron conductivity, because of the accelerated charge transfer derived from the unique porosity and nitrogen heteroatom-doping. More interestingly, the increase of surface area of NIP-HC does not lead to a decrease of the initial efficiency. At the same time, a high plateau capacity (172.8 mAh g-1) can be obtained below 0.1 V, which shows great potential for practical application in the full cells. As suggested by IG/ID from Raman tests, the degree of graphitization increases accompanied by the melting & evaporation process, which improves the electrical conductivity of the HC material as well. Furthermore, according to First-principle calculation, it is found that the nitrogen is conducive to increase the electron density around Fermi level, which intrinsically enhances the electrical conductivity and enriches active sites for sodium-ions storage. The result from this study has provided insights on producing interpenetrated porous HC by a simple and novel salt melting & evaporation process and enriched the methods of pore structure preparation.",

To address these issues, we report a unique 3D porous self-standing foam electrode built from core-shelled Sb@In2O3 nanostructures via a continuous electrodepositing strategy coupled with surface chemical passivation. Such a hierarchical structure possesses a robust framework with rich voids and a dense protection layer (In2O3), which allow Sb nanoparticles to well accommodate their mechanical strain for efficiently avoiding electrode cracks and pulverization with stable electrode/electrolyte interphase upon sodiation/de-sodiation processes.

While it is generally believed that mechanical degradation, namely pulverization and subsequent loss of electrical contact, is the underlying cause, here we show gassing is an essential problem in sodium-ion batteries with Sn anode. Since the gas generation appears at a certain voltage, reducing the voltage through metallurgically pre-alloying Sn with Na could be a solution, with an added benefit of compensating for \"live\" Na loss in future cycles. When the metallurgically alloyed foil was used as the anode in Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPFs)//alloy full cells, the ICE is significantly improved from 24.68% to 75%, and from the 2nd cycle to the 100th cycle, the average Coulombic efficiency can maintain up to 99.44%.

Because of the size difference between Li and Na, the commercial anode material graphite in Li-ion batteries does not work for Na-ion batteries. Thus, it will be ideal if some universal anode materials could work for both Li- and Na-ion batteries with high performance. Inspired by a recent study on the high performance of a 2D-Si2BN sheet as an anode material for Li-ion batteries, we design a three dimensional (3D) porous structure by using the nanoribbons of a Si2BN sheet as building blocks. Based on the state-of-the-art ab initio calculations, we find that the resulting 3D porous Si2BN structure is stable chemically, dynamically and thermally, exhibiting a high specific capacity of 512.42 (341.61 mA h g-1), a low voltage of 0.27 V (0.15 V), a small volume expansion of 2.5% (2.7%), and a low migration energy barrier of 0.44 eV (0.19 eV) for Li- (Na-) ion batteries. These intriguing features, together with the light mass and rich abundance of Si, B and N, suggest that the 3D porous Si2BN structure is a promising candidate for the anode material of both Li- and Na-ion batteries.",

Here, we report a high-performing microsized Sb anode for both LIBs and SIBs by coupling with fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) containing electrolytes. The optimum amount of FEC (10 vol.%) renders a stable LiF/NaF-rich SEI on Sb electrodes that can suppress the continuous electrolytes decomposition and accommodate the volume variation. The microsized Sb electrode gradually evolves into an integrity assembled by nanoparticles in FEC-containing electrolytes during cycling, which is totally different from that in the FEC-free counterpart. As a result, the microsized Sb electrodes exhibit a reversible capacity of 540 mAh g-1 with 85.3% capacity retention after 150 cycles at 1000 mA g-1 for LIBs and 605 mAh g-1 with 95.4% capacity retention after 150 cycles at 200 mA g-1 for SIBs. More impressively, the prototype full Li-based (i.e., Sb/LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cell) and Na-based (i.e., Sb/Na3V2(PO4)2O2F cell) batteries also achieve good cycling durability.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted tremendous attention as potential low-cost energy storage alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to the intrinsic safety and great abundance of sodium. For developing competitive SIBs, highly efficient anode materials with large capacity and rapid ion diffusion are indispensable. In this study, a two-dimensional (2D) Dirac monolayer, that is, borophosphene, is proposed as a promising anode material for high performance SIBs on the basis of density functional theory calculations. The performances of Na adsorption and diffusion, maximum specific capacity, open circuit voltage, cyclical stability and electronic properties combined with Bader charge analysis are explored. It is found that borophosphene can spontaneously adsorb a Na atom with a binding energy of -0.838 eV. A low diffusion energy barrier of 0.221 eV suggests rapid ion conductivity. More intriguingly, a maximum specific capacity of 1282 mA h g-1 can be achieved in borophosphene, which is one of the largest values reported for 2D anode materials for SIBs. A low average voltage of 0.367 V is estimated, implying a suitable operating voltage of the anode material. The metallic properties, tiny surface expansion, and good kinetic stability of sodiated borophosphene give rise to high electrical conductivity and favorable cyclability. These abovementioned advantages suggest that borophosphene can be used as a Dirac anode material for SIBs with excellent performance including a large specific capacity, high-rate capability, and favorable cyclability.",

        "title": "Activated Amorphous Carbon With High-Porosity Derived From Camellia Pollen Grains as Anode Materials for Lithium/Sodium Ion Batteries",
        "abstract": "Carbonaceous anode materials are commonly utilized in the energy storage systems, while their unsatisfied electrochemical performances hardly meet the increasing requirements for advanced anode materials. Here, activated amorphous carbon (AAC) is synthesized by carbonizing renewable camellia pollen grains with naturally hierarchical structure, which not only maintains abundant micro- and mesopores with surprising specific surface area (660 m2 g−1), but also enlarges the interlayer spacing from 0.352 to 0.4 nm, effectively facilitating ions transport, intercalation, and adsorption. Benefiting from such unique characteristic, AAC exhibits 691.7 mAh g−1 after 1200 cycles at 2 A g−1, and achieves 459.7, 335.4, 288.7, 251.7, and 213.5 mAh g−1 at 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5 A g−1 in rate response for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Additionally, reversible capacities of 324.8, 321.6, 312.1, 298.9, 282.3, 272.4 mAh g−1 at various rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5 A g−1 are preserved for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The results reveal that the AAC anode derived from camellia pollen grains can display excellent cyclic life and superior rate performances, endowing the infinite potential to extend its applications in LIBs and SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Pristine and boron-doped anatase TiO2 were prepared via a facile sol-gel method and the hydrothermal method for application as anode materials in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The sol-gel method leads to agglomerated TiO2, whereas the hydrothermal method is conducive to the formation of highly crystalline and discrete nanoparticles. The structure, morphology, and electrochemical properties were studied. The crystal size of TiO2 with boron doping is smaller than that of the nondoped crystals, which indicates that the addition of boron can inhibit the crystal growth. The electrochemical measurements demonstrated that the reversible capacity of the B-doped TiO2 is higher than that for the pristine sample. B-doping also effectively enhances the rate performance. The capacity of the B-doped TiO2 could reach 150 mAh/g at the high current rate of 2C and the capacity decay is only about 8 mAh/g over 400 cycles. The remarkable performance could be attributed to the lattice expansion resulting from B doping and the shortened Li(+) diffusion distance due to the nanosize. These results indicate that B-doped TiO2 can be a good candidate for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) has drawn widespread attention as an ideal candidate anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high specific capacity of 946 mA h g−1 in conversion and alloy reactions. Nevertheless, volume expansion, a common flaw for conversion-alloy type materials during the sodiation and desodiation processes, is bad for the structure of materials and thus obstructs the application of antimony sulfide in energy storage. A common approach to solve this problem is by introducing carbon or other matrices as buffer material. However, the common preparation of Sb2S3 could result in environmental pollution and excessive energy consumption in most cases. To incorporate green chemistry, natural stibnite ore (Sb2S3) after modification via carbon sheets was applied as a first-hand material in SIBs through a facile and efficient strategy. The unique composites exhibited an outstanding electrochemical performance with a higher reversible capacity, a better rate capability, as well as an excellent cycling stability compared to that of the natural stibnite ore. In short, the study is expected to offer a new approach to improve Sb2S3 composites as an anode in SIBs and a reference for the development of natural ore as a first-hand material in energy storage.",

However, to compensate for the sluggish reaction kinetics and higher intrinsic potential of Na+ compared to Li+, cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable electrode materials must be explored for practical applications. Herein, 2D ternary tin thiophosphate (SnP2S6) nanosheets (∼10 nm thickness) grown on graphene (denoted as SPS/G hybrid) are demonstrated as intriguing anodes for SIBs. The asymmetric-layered structure and ternary composition enable the SPS/G hybrid with a high reversible capacity (1230 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1), superior rate capability (200 mAh g-1 at 15 A g-1), and an exceptional capacity retention of 76% after 1000 cycles at 2.0 A g-1. More importantly, a prototype sodium-ion full cell constructed by pairing with the Na3V2O2(PO4)3F cathode affords a high capacity of 470 mAh g-1 at 30 mA g-1 (on the basis of anode weight) and good cyclic capacity of 360 mAh g-1 at 150 mA g-1.

In this work, a highly porous carbon/tin sulfide aerogel with a \"skeleton/skin\" morphology (SSC@SnS2) has been developed and further used as a binder-free anode for SIBs. This SSC@SnS2 electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 612 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, a good rate capability, and a long-term cycling stability up to 1000 times with an average Coulombic efficiency of ∼99.9%. Meanwhile, this SSC@SnS2 aerogel also achieves a stable cycling performance even at a high current density up to 5.0 A g-1. The fast-yet-stable sodium ion storage performance of the prepared SSC@SnS2 aerogel can be ascribed to the reasons that (i) the carbon nanofiber/graphene skeleton provides unimpeded pathways for the rapid transfer of electrons; (ii) thin SnS2 skin with nonaggregated morphology can provide a great number of active sites for sodium ion storage; (iii) the porous structure of the SSC@SnS2 aerogel ensures a rapid penetration of electrolyte and can further accommodate the volume expansion of active SnS2 nanoflakes; and (iv) the intermediate product of Na15Sn4 alloy contributes greatly to the sodium ion storage performance of the SSC@SnS2 aerogel.

The hierarchical carbon matrix not only provides sufficient internal void space to accommodate the large volume expansion of Ge nanoparticles, but also provides numerous open channels for the easy access of electrolyte and Na/Li ions. As half-cell tests revealed, the composite provides discharge capacity of 303 mA h g−1 (1st cycle) and 160 mA h g−1 (700th cycle) for SIBs, 1146.7 mA h g−1 (1st cycle) and 600 mA h g−1 (500th cycle) for LIBs at a current density of 500 mA g−1 (all the presented capacity based on the total weight of Ge/C composites).

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted increasing attentions as promising alternatives to lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, we design and synthesize ultrasmall MnO nanoparticles (∼4 nm) supported on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NDCT@MnO) as promising anode materials of SIBs. It is revealed that the carbonization temperature can greatly influence the structural features and thus the Na-storage behavior of the NDCT@MnO nanocomposites. The synergetic interaction between MnO and NDCT in the NDCT@MnO nanocomposites provides high rate capability and long-term cycling life due to high surface area, electrical conductivity, enhanced diffusion rate of Na+ ions, and prevented agglomeration and high stability of MnO nanoparticles. The resulting SIBs provide a high reversible specific capacity of 709 mAh g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1 and a high capacity of 536 mAh g-1 almost without loss after 250 cycles at 0.2 A g-1. Even at a high current density of 5 A g-1, a capacity of 273 mAh g-1 can be maintained after 3000 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Developing the three-dimensional self-assembled nanoarchitecture with well-defined crystal structure is an effective strategy to enhance the electrochemical performances of electrode materials. Herein, (110)-oriented and bridged nanoblocks self-assembled VS4 microspheres are controllably synthesized by a facile one-step hydrothermal method. (110)-bridged structure sets up open pathways for Na+ diffusion among nanoblocks, and (110)-oriented structure provides unobstructed pathways for Na+ diffusion in nanoblocks, which collectively construct the multi-dimensional Na+ transfer channels in the VS4 microspheres, and then promote the electrochemical kinetics. This material, as an anode of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), exhibits pseudocapacitive Na+ storage process and excellent rate capability, delivering a high capacity of 339 and 270 mAhg-1 at a rate of 0.1 and 2.0 Ag-1 with a capacity retention of 79% in the voltage window of 0.5 ~ 3.0 V. Particularly, the reversible capacity reaches up to 575 mAhg-1 after 300 cycles even at 1.0 Ag-1 in the voltage window of 0.05 ~ 3.0 V, outperforming those of the ever-reported VS4-based anode materials.

However, the commercial graphite anode is not suitable for SIBs because of its low Na+ ions storage capability and poor cycling stability. Recently, another alternative as anode for SIBs, amorphous carbon materials, have attracted tremendous attention because of their abundant resource, nontoxicity, and most importantly, stability. Here, N-doped hierarchical porous carbon microspheres (NHPCS) derived from Ni-MOF have been prepared and used as anode for SIBs. Benefiting from the open porous structure and expanded interlayer distance, the diffusion of Na+ is greatly facilitated and the Na+ storage capacity is significantly enhanced concurrently. The NHPCS exhibit high reversible capacity (291 mA h g−1 at current of 200 mA g−1), excellent rate performance (256 mA h g−1 at high current of 1,000 mA g−1), and outstanding cycling stability (204 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles).",

In this study, a precursor of Co1-xS with a uniform and hollow nanospherical architecture is obtained with a high yield via a mild solvothermal method in the presence of 2-methylimidazole at first. Then, Co1-xS, Co1-xS/C (ultrafine Co1-xS nanoparticles embedded in the shells of the nitrogen-doped porous carbon hollow nanosphere), and Co1-xS@C (Co1-xS nanoparticles entirely covered by an external amorphous carbon layer) were selectively fabricated via direct calcination or PPy coating & calcination of the obtained precursor. Co1-xS/C shows best electrochemical performance than the other two materials as anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Besides the excellent rate performance, a high reversible discharge capacity of 320 mA g-1 can be retained after 130 cycles at 1 A g-1. The impressive performance may be attributed to the unique structure, higher conductivity, and more active sites of Co1-xS/C. In addition, 559 mA h g-1 was maintained after 100 cycles at 500 mA g-1 when the Co1-xS/C composite was applied as an anode in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).

        "abstract": "Due to the Earth's scarcity of lithium, replacing lithium with earth-abundant and low-cost sodium for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) has recently become a promising substitute for lithium-ion batteries. However, the shortage of appropriate anode materials limits the development of SIBs. Here, a dual-carbon conductive network enhanced GeP5 (GeP5/acetylene black/partially reduced graphene oxide sheets (GeP5/AB/p-rGO)) composite is successfully prepared by a facile ball milling method. The dual-carbon network not only provides more transport pathways for electrons but also relaxes the huge volume change of the electrode material during the charge/discharge process. Compared with only AB- or GO-modified GeP5 (GeP5/AB or GeP5/GO) composite, the GeP5/AB/p-rGO composite shows a superior sodium storage performance with an excellent rate and cycle performance. It delivers a high reversible capacity of 597.5 and 175 mAh/g at the current density of 0.1 and 5.0 A/g, respectively. Furthermore, at the current density of 0.5 A/g, the GeP5/AB/p-rGO composite shows the reversible capacity of 400 mAh/g after 50 cycles with a little capacity attenuation. All above results prove that the GeP5/AB/p-rGO composite has a good prospect of application as an anode material for SIBs.",

The application has been also studied for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). The finely crystallized CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (around 5 nm in size) are uniformly grown on the PPy nanotubes. When tested as anode materials for SIBs, the CFO-PPy-NT electrode maintains a discharge capacity of 400 mA h g-1 and a stable Coulombic efficiency of 98% after 200 cycles at 100 mA g-1. Even at a higher current density of 1000 mA g-1, the composite can still retain a discharge capacity of 220 mA h g-1 after 2000 cycles. The superior electrochemical performance could be mainly ascribed to the uniform distribution of CoFe2O4 on the 3-D matrix of PPy interconnected nanotubes, which favors the diffusion of sodium ions and electronic transportation and also buffers the large volumetric expansion during charge/discharge. Thereby our study suggests that such CFO-PPy-NTs have great potential as an anode material for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have been regarded as a prime candidate for large-scale energy storage, and developing high performance anode materials is one of the main challenges for advanced SIBs. Novel structured Sn-MoS2 -C@C microspheres, in which Sn nanoparticles are evenly embedded in MoS2 nanosheets and a thin carbon film is homogenously engineered over the microspheres, have been fabricated by the hydrothermal method. The Sn-MoS2 -C@C microspheres demonstrate an excellent Na-storage performance as an anode of SIBs and deliver a high reversible charge capacity (580.3 mAh g-1 at 0.05 Ag-1 ) and rate capacity (580.3, 373, 326, 285.2, and 181.9 mAh g-1 at 0.05, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 Ag-1 , respectively). A high charge specific capacity of 245 mAh g-1 can still be achieved after 2750 cycles at 2 Ag-1 , indicating an outstanding cycling performance. The high capacity and long-term stability make Sn-MoS2 -C@C composite a very promising anode material for SIBs.",

However, SIBs still have some challenges in competing with lithium-ion batteries for practical applications. Particularly, the high rate capability and cycling stability are posing big problems for SIBs. Here, nitrogen-doped carbon-coated WS2 nanosheets (WS2/NC) were successfully synthesized by a high-temperature solution method, followed by carbonization of polypyrrole. When used as anode electrodes for SIBs, WS2/NC composite exhibited high-rate capacity at 386 and 238.1 mAh g−1 at 50 and 2,000 mA g−1, respectively. Furthermore, even after 400 cycle, the composite electrode could still deliver a capacity of ~180.1 mAh g−1 at 1,000 mA g−1, corresponding to a capacity loss of 0.09% per cycle. The excellent electrochemical performance could be attributed to the synergistic effect of the highly conductive nature of the nitrogen-doped carbon-coating and WS2 nanosheets. Results showed that the WS2/NC nanosheets are promising electrode materials for SIBs application.",

Here, inspired by natural flower structures, we take advantage of the three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical flower-like stable microstructures formed by two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets to solve these problems. By precise control of the hydrothermal synthesis conditions, a novel three-dimensional (3D) flower-like architecture consisting of 2D Na2Ti3O7 nanosheets (Na-TNSs) has been successfully synthesized. The arbitrarily arranged but closely interlinked thin nanosheets in carnation-shaped 3D Na2Ti3O7 microflowers (Na-TMFs) originate a good network of electrically conductive paths in an electrode. Thus, Na-TMFs can get electrons from all directions and be fully utilized for sodium-ion insertion and extraction reactions, which can improve sodium storage properties with enhanced rate capability and super cycling performance. Furthermore, the large specific surface area provides a high capacity, which can be ascribed to the pseudo-capacitance effect. The wettability of the electrolyte was also improved by the porous and crumpled structure. The remarkably improved cycling performance and rate capability of Na-TMFs make a captivating case for its development as an advanced anode material for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted considerable attention as an alternative energy-storage technology in recent years. Developing advanced sodium storage anode materials with appropriate working potential, high capacity, and good cycling performance is very important. Herein, we demonstrate a nanostructured tellurium@carbon (nano-Te@C) composite by confining nano-Te molecules in the space of carbon micropores as an attractive anode material for SIBs. The nano-Te@C anode presents an appropriate redox potential in the range of 1.05-1.35 V (vs Na(+)/Na), which avoids the Na dendrite problem and achieves a high reversible capacity of 410 mA h g(-1) on the basis of a two-electron redox reaction mechanism. Notably, the nano-Te@C exhibits an admirable long-term cycling stability with a high capacity retention of 90% for 1000 cycles (i.e., ultralow capacity decay of 0.01% per cycle). The excellent electrochemical property of nano-Te@C benefits from the high electroactivity from the nanostructure design and the effective confinement of the microporous carbon host. In addition, a Na-ion full cell by using nano-Te@C as anode and Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 as cathode is demonstrated for the first time and exhibits a remarkable capacity retention up to 95% after 150 cycles.

        "abstract": "Silver molybdate, Ag2 Mo2 O7 , has been prepared by a conventional solid-state reaction. Its electrochemical properties as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been comprehensively examined by means of galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling, cyclic voltammetry, and rate performance measurements. At operating voltages between 3.0 and 0.01 V, the electrode delivered a reversible capacity of nearly 190 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 20 mA g(-1) after 70 cycles. Ag2 Mo2 O7 also demonstrated a good rate capability and long-term cycle stability, the capacity reaching almost 100 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 500 mA g(-1) , with a capacity retention of 55 % over 1000 cycles. Moreover, the sodium storage process of Ag2 Mo2 O7 has been investigated by means of ex situ XRD, Raman spectroscopy, and HRTEM. Interestingly, the anode decomposes into Ag metal and Na2 MoO4 during the initial discharge process, and then Na(+) ions are considered to be inserted into/extracted from the Na2 MoO4 lattice in the subsequent cycles governed by an intercalation/deintercalation mechanism. Ex situ HRTEM images revealed that Ag metal not only remains unchanged during the sodiation/desodiation processes, but is well dispersed throughout the amorphous matrix, thereby greatly improving the electronic conductivity of the working electrode. The \"in situ\" decomposition behavior of Ag2 Mo2 O7 is distinct from that of chemically synthesized, metal-nanoparticle-coated electrode materials, and provides strong supplementary insight into the mechanism of such new anode materials for SIBs and may set a precedent for the design of further materials.",

Organic conjugated carboxylic acid anodes not only have tailorable electrochemical properties but also are easily accessible.

In this study, disodium terephthalate (Na2 TP), the most favorable organic conjugated carboxylic acid anode material for SIBs, was proposed to integrate with graphene oxide (GO) by an anti-solvent precipitation process, which ensures the uniform and tight coating of GO on the Na2 TP surface. GO is electrochemically reduced during the first several cycles of the electrochemical measurement, which buffers the volume change and improves the electrical conductivity of Na2 TP, resulting in a better cyclic and rate performance. The incorporation of only 5 wt % GO onto Na2 TP leads to a reversible capability of 235 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at a current rate of 0.1 C, which is the best among the state of the art organic anodes for SIBs.

We also compare the electrochemical characteristics of phosphides with their corresponding sulfides, using the environmentally benign iron compounds, FeP and FeS(2), as a case study.

The reduced Na+-dipole interactions facilitate more anionic coordination in the first solvation sheath, which consistently maintains anion-enhanced solvation structures from room to low temperatures to promote inorganic-rich SEI formation. These enable WSE with a low freezing point of -83.3°C and faster Na+ desolvation kinetics. The HC anode thus affords reversible capacities of 243.2 and 205.4 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 at -40 and -60°C, respectively, and the full cell of HC||Na3V2(PO4)3 yields an extended lifespan over 250 cycles with high capacity retention of ~100% at -40°C. This work sheds new lights on the ion-dipole regulation for ultra-low temperature SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) has been widely regarded as the most promising anode material for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) due to its decent capacity and low cost. However, the poor initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of HC seriously hinders its practical application in SIBs. Herein, pyridinic N‐doped hard carbon polyhedra with easily accessible carbonyl groups and in situ coupled carbon nanotubes are rationally synthesized via a facile pretreated zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIFs)‐carbonization strategy. The comprehensive ex/in situ techniques combined with theoretical calculations reveal that the synergy of pyridinic‐N and carbonyl groups promoted by the pretreatment and carbonization process would not only optimize the Na+ adsorption energy but also accelerate the desorption of Na+, significantly suppressing the irreversible capacity loss. As a result, the as‐synthesized hard carbon polyhedra as an anode can deliver an unprecedented high ICE of 98% with a large reversible capacity of 389.4 mAh g−1 at 0.03 A g−1.

        "abstract": "Porous carbon has been widely focused to solve the problems of low coulombic efficiency (ICE) and low multiplication capacity of Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) anodes. The superior energy storage properties of two-dimensional(2D) carbon nanosheets can be realized by modulating the structure, but be limited by the carbon sources, making it challenging to obtain 2D structures with large surface area. In this work, a new method for forming carbon materials with high N/S doping content based on combustion activation using the dual activation effect of K2 SO4 /KNO3 is proposed. The synthesized carbon material as an anode for SIBs has a high reversible capacity of 344.44 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 . Even at the current density of 5 Ag-1 , the capacity remained at 143.08 mAh g-1 . And the ICE of sodium-ion in ether electrolytes is ≈2.5 times higher than that in ester electrolytes. The sodium storage mechanism of ether/ester-based electrolytes is further explored through ex-situ characterizations. The disparity in electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the discrepancy in kinetics, wherein ether-based electrolytes exhibit a higher rate of Na+ storage and shedding compared to ester-based electrolytes. This work suggests an effective way to develop doubly doped carbon anode materials for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Unordered vacancies engineered in host anode materials cannot well maintain the uniform Na+ adsorbed and possibly render the local structural stress intense, resulting in electrode peeling and battery failure. Here, the indium is first introduced into Cu2Se to achieve the formation of CuInSe2. Next, an ion extraction strategy is employed to fabricate Cu0.54In1.15Se2 enriched with ordered vacancies by spontaneous formation of defect pairs. Such ordered defects, compared with unordered ones, can serve as myriad sodium ion micropumps evenly distributing in crystalline host to homogenize the adsorbed Na+ and the generated volumetric stress during the electrochemistry. Furthermore, Cu0.54In1.15Se2 is indeed proved by the calculations to exhibit smaller volumetric variation than the counterpart with unordered vacancies. Thanks to the distinct ordered vacancy structure, the material exhibits a highly reversible capacity of 428 mAh g−1 at 1 C and a high‐rate stability of 311.7 mAh g−1 at 10 C after 5000 cycles when employed as an anode material for Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs).

Inspired by the structure of biological cell membranes, N/P co‐doped hard carbon nanospheres (NPCS) anodes with abundant ultramicropores (≈0.6 nm) are proposed and synthesized as robust sodium anodes. Based on density functional theory calculations, optimizing ultramicropores can enable small Na+ to be well confined within the pores and hinder large solvent molecules from invading and reacting, introducing N/P species contributes to the rapid adsorption/diffusion of Na+. In situ XRD and Raman analysis suggest that the nanoconfinement strategy induced by abundant ultramicropores and N/P co‐doping enables highly reversible electrochemical reactions. Electrochemical test confirms that the nanoconfinement strategy endows the NPCS anode with high reversible capacity (376.3 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1), superior initial coulombic efficiency (87.3% at 1.0 A g−1), remarkable rate capability (155.6 mAh g−1 at 50.0 A g−1) and excellent cycling stability (with capacity retention of ≈94.6% after 10 000 cycles), lightening a promising avenue for developing SIB with robust durability.",

Here, a comprehensive regulation on the interfacial/bulk electrochemistry of hard carbons through atomic Zn doping is reported, which demonstrates a record‐high reversible capacity (546 mAh g−1), decent ICE (84%), remarkable rate capability (140 mAh g−1 @ 50 A g−1), and excellent LT capacity (443 mAh g−1 @ −40 °C), outperforming the state‐of‐the‐art literature. This work reveals that the Zn doping can generally induce a local electric field to enable fast bulk Na+ transportation, and meanwhile catalyze the decomposition of NaPF6 to form a robust inorganic‐rich solid‐electrolyte interphase, which elaborates the underlying origin of the boosted electrochemical performance. Importantly, distinguished from room temperature, the intrinsic Na+ migration/desolvation ability of the electrolyte is disclosed to be the crucial rate‐determining factors for the SIB performance at LT.

Herein, a CO2‐etching strategy is applied to generate abundant closed pores in starch‐derived hard carbon that effectively enhances Na+ plateau storage. During CO2 etching, open pores are first formed on the carbon matrix, which are in situ reorganized to closed pores through high‐temperature carbonization. This CO2‐assisted pore‐regulation strategy increases the diameter and the capacity of closed pores in HC, and simultaneously maintains the microsphere morphology (10–30 µm in diameter). The optimal HC anode exhibits a Na‐storage capacity of 487.6 mAh g−1 with a high initial Coulomb efficiency of 90.56%. A record‐high plateau capacity of 351 mAh g−1 is achieved, owing to the abundant closed micropores generated by CO2‐etching. Comprehensive in situ and ex situ tests unravel that the high Na+ storage performance originates from the pore‐filling mechanism in the closed micropores.",

The morphology of ultrathin hollow spherical shells and confinement of in situ carbon layer to active materials provide rich channels for ion/electron transfer and alleviate the effects of volume change and agglomeration of the material.

For improving the sodium storage capacity of HC anode, current research primarily focuses on the high‐voltage slope region.

Therefore, in this study, HC anode with rich closed pore structure is designed and constructed with the help of carbon dots (CDs), and it is demonstrated that the presence of closed pore structure can provide more sodium storage sites in the plateau region, resulting in an obvious increase of sodium storage capacity. Moreover, the pore‐filling and intercalation mechanism for sodium storage in plateau region is revealed by in situ Raman spectroscopy and ex situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It is worth noting that the increase in capacity induced by closed pore‐filling is not accompanied by a decrease in initial coulombic efficiency (ICE), due to the fact that the introduction of closed pores does not increase the contact area between electrode and electrolyte.

Results show that despite larger Shannon’s radius of potassium-ions and their sluggish diffusion in Td-WTe2 due to higher overpotential, at 100 mA.g−1 KIB-half cells showed higher cycling stability and low capacity decay of 4% versus 16% compared to SIB-half cells.

Here, a coaxial composite of single-wall carbon nanotube bundle (SWCNTB/SnO2 ) nanoparticles (NPs)/N-doped carbon shell (SWCNTB@SnO2 @C) is constructed, where SWCNTBs with exceptional elasticity are explored as a self-adaptive substrate to supply a highly resilient conductive network. Within the confinement of hard carbon shells, SWCNTB can produce radially elastic deformation to accommodate the volume change of SnO2 during Li+ /Na+ insertion/extraction. This overcomes the problem of strain fracturing of the outer carbon shell, as well as maintains close electrical contact between SnO2 and the conductive network. The LIB/SIB with the self-adaptive SWCNTB@SnO2 @C electrode presents a series of superior battery performances, for example, a high specific capacity of 608 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1 and 600 cycles in LIB without capacity decay.",

        "abstract": "The chemical environments of the interlayer Na sites of layered titanate are finely controlled by the intercalation of n-alkylamine with various alkyl chain lengths to explore an effective way to improve its electrode functionality for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The n-alkylamine intercalation via ion-exchange and exfoliation-restacking routes allows the modification of in-plane structures of layered titanate to be tuned. Among the present n-alkylamine-intercalates, the n-pentylamine-intercalated titanate shows the largest discharge capacity with the best rate characteristics, underscoring the critical role of optimized intracrystalline structure in improving the SIB electrode performance of layered titanate. The creation of turbostratic in-plane structure degrades the SIB electrode performance of layered titanate, indicating the detrimental effect of in-plane structural disorder on electrode activity. 23Na magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrates that the n-alkylamine-intercalated titanates possess two different interlayer Na+ sites near ammonium head groups/titanate layers and near alkyl chains. The intercalation of long-chain molecules increases the population of the latter site and the overall mobility of Na+ ions, which is responsible for the improvement of electrode activity upon n-alkylamine intercalation. The present study highlights that the increased population of interlayer metal sites remote from the host layers is effective in improving the electrode functionality of layered metal oxide for SIBs and multivalent ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Spinel lithium titanate (LTO; Li4Ti5O12) is one of the promising materials for negative electrodes of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The stable charge-discharge performance of SIB cells using LTO electrodes depends on the reversible Na insertion-extraction mechanism of LTO, where the spinel lattice is expanded with Na insertion, and two phases, Na-inserted LTO (Na-LTO) and Li-inserted LTO (Li-LTO) phases, are generated. These phases are confirmed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), while the mechanism of the two-phase coexistence with different lattice volumes is yet unclear. Here, we investigate the detailed morphology of the coexisting Na-LTO and Li-LTO phases using in situ XRD measurements and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation. Na-LTO (a = 8.74 Å) and Li-LTO (a = 8.36 Å) phases are confirmed in both the electrochemically formed Na-inserted LTO electrode and the single-crystalline LTO thin specimen. We observed that the Na-LTO/Li-LTO interface is parallel to the (001) plane, and contains an inevitable lattice mismatch along the interface, while the expansion of the Na-LTO phase can be partially relaxed normal to the interface. We observed that the Na-LTO/Li-LTO interface has interface layers of lattice disordering with a 1-2 nm width, relaxing the lattice mismatch, as opposed to results from the previous scanning TEM observation. How the different lattice volumes at the two-phase interface are relaxed should be the key issue in investigation of the mechanism of Na insertion and extraction in LTO electrodes.",

        "abstract": "Selecting suitable electrode materials for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) often relies on the experience gained from lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), particularly in terms of thermodynamics. However, this approach may fall into a stagnant situation where the development of SIBs consistently lags behind that of LIBs due to the larger ionic radius of Na+. Accordingly, it is crucial to establish a dedicated selection rule specifically tailored for SIB electrodes to overcome this challenge. Herein, a screening method is proposed for SIB materials, where an ideal candidate shall form a stable intermediate transition phase with Na+. This phase acts as an important bridge that can regulate the insertion/extraction of charge carriers. Atomically resolved transmission electron microscopy demonstrates that KCu7S4 can react with Na+ to form a stable intermediate phase (Na3Cu4S4). Na3Cu4S4 can undergo reversible conversion reactions, contribute capacity, stabilize the tunnel structure and enhance the migration/diffusion of Na+. In contrast, Li+ can't form a stable intermediate phase in KCu7S4 during lithiation/delithiation, thus losing the ability to effectively regulate Li+ insertion/extraction. These findings provide valuable insights for the development of suitable electrode materials for SIBs, emphasizing the importance of stable intermediate phases in regulating charge carrier insertion/extraction and improving overall battery performance.",

When Cu2Se/Co3Se4@NPC composite is utilized as an anode electrode material in LIB and SIB half cells, the material demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance and remarkable cycle stability with retaining high capacities. In LIB and SIB half cells, the Cu2Se/Co3Se4@NPC anode material shows the ultralong lifespan at 2000 mAg-1, retaining a capacity of 543 mAhg-1 after 750 cycles, and retaining a capacity of 251 mAhg-1 after 200 cycles at 100 mAg-1, respectively. The porous structure of the Cu2Se/Co3Se4@NPC anode material can not only effectively tolerate the volume expansion of the electrode during discharging and charging, but also facilitate the penetration of electrolyte and efficiently prevents the clustering of active particles.

However, the inherent shortcomings of metal phosphating materials, such as conductivity, kinetics, volume strain, etc are not satisfactory, which hinders their large-scale application. Here, a CoP@carbon nanofibers-composite containing rich Co─N─C heterointerface and phosphorus vacancies grown on carbon cloth (CoP1-x@MEC) is synthesized as SIB anode to accomplish extraordinary capacity and ultra-long cycle life.

Energy and power requirements for these applications need to be satisfied. Besides material improvement, electrode microstructure plays a critical role. Here, the influence of hard carbon (HC) particle size and mass loading on the rate performance have been investigated. This work measured the relative contribution of ionic resistance within the porous electrode (Rion) in SIB full cells employing relevant mass loadings. Rion was obtained by applying electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to symmetrical cells and by fitting a transmission line model under “blocking” conditions. The relative contribution of Rion arising from HC electrodes was further compared to the charge transfer resistance (RCT) in full cell configuration utilising a three-electrode cell under “non-blocking” conditions. Results illustrate mass loading as far more influential on cell rate performance compared to the two particle sizes tested. The three-electrode study reveals the contribution of Rion to be greater than that of RCT at high mass loadings and high states of charge for the HC electrode and elucidated that the gravimetric and volumetric discharge capacity of cells is limited by the layered oxide cathode and HC electrode, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have received increasing attention because of their appealing cell voltages and cost-effective features. However, the atom aggregation and electrode volume variation inevitably deteriorate the sodium storage kinetics. Here a new strategy is proposed to boost the lifetime of SIB by synthesizing sea urchin-like FeSe2 /nitrogen-doped carbon (FeSe2 /NC) composites. The robust FeN coordination hinders the Fe atom aggregation and accommodates the volume expansion, while the unique biomorphic morphology and high conductivity of FeSe2 /NC enhance the intercalation/deintercalation kinetics and shorten the ion/electron diffusion length. As expected, FeSe2 /NC electrodes deliver excellent half (387.6 mAh g-1 at 20.0 A g-1 after 56 000 cycles) and full (203.5 mAh g-1 at 1.0 A g-1 after 1200 cycles) cell performances.

Herein, a dual carbon design strategy is proposed to integrate with highly active heterojunctions to overcome the above issues. In this new design, CoS2/CoO hollow dodecahedron heterojunctions are sandwiched between open framework carbon-spheres (OFCs) and a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanomembrane (OFC@CoS2/CoO@rGO). The CoS2/CoO heterojunctions effectively promote electron transfer on their surface and provide more electrochemical active sites through their hierarchical hollow structures assembled by nanodots. Meanwhile, the dual-carbon framework forms a highly conductive network that enables a better rate capability. More importantly, the dual carbon can greatly buffer volume expansion and stable reaction interfaces of electrode material during the charge/discharge process. Benefitting from their synergistical effects, the OFC@CoS2/CoO@rGO electrode achieves a high reversible capacity of 460 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 and still maintains 205.3 mAh g-1 even when current density is increased by 200 times when used as an anode material for SIBs. Their cycling property is also remarkable with a maintained capacity of 161 mAh g-1 after 3500 charging/discharging cycles at a high current density of 1 A g-1.

Herein we report a solvent mechanochemical protocol for the in situ fabrication of the HC-MXene/TiO2 electrode by functionalizing MXene to improve the electrochemical performance of the batteries. MXene (Ti3C2Tx) with abundant oxygen-containing functional groups reacts with HC particles in the ball milling process to form a Ti-O-C covalent cross-linked HC-MXene composite, in which the edge of the MXene nanosheets is in situ oxidized by air to form TiO2 nanorods, forming a regular 1D/2D MXene/TiO2 heterojunction structure. Ti-O-C covalent bonding can protect the heterojunction structures from pulverization and detachment from the current collector during charge/discharge cycles due to sodium-ion intercalation/detachment, thus improving the stability of the electrode structure. Meanwhile, the MXene/TiO2 heterojunction can form a 3D conductive network and provide more active sites. The resulting HC-MXene/TiO2 electrode exhibits superior electrode capacity (660 mAh g-1), making it a promising anode material for SIBs.

MXenes could be candidate electrode materials due to their excellent electrical conductivity and large specific surface area. In this work, the theoretical performance of Ti- and Zr-containing MXenes Ti3C2T2 (T = O, F, OH) and Zr3C2T2 (T = O, F, OH, S) as SIB anode materials is investigated. The influence of the Hubbard U correction is discussed, and the behaviour at the MXene surface with the partial occupation of sodium atoms is considered. Including the weight and volume of adsorbed sodium atoms, Ti3C2O2 presents the best performance among the seven MXenes studied. Its mass and volumetric capacities are 299 mA h g-1 and 993 mA h cm-3 respectively, and the migration barrier and open circuit voltage are 0.138 eV and 0.421 V. Both Zr3C2O2 and Zr3C2S2 can adsorb double layers of sodium atoms on both sides, and the former shows a higher capacity because of its lower weight and smaller volume. The mass and volumetric capacities of Zr3C2O2 are 254 mA h g-1 and 913 mA h cm-3 respectively. More importantly, the surface potential is determined to be an effective descriptor for selecting electrode materials. The migration barrier is proportional to the fluctuation amplitude of the surface potential. A low surface potential generally implies a high capacity. A large open circuit voltage is prone to appear in the structure with a large fluctuation amplitude and a low average value of its surface potential.",

        "abstract": "The design and construction of flexible electrodes that can function at high rates and high areal capacities are essential regarding the practical application of flexible sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and other energy storage devices, which remains significantly challenging by far.

In this hybrid film, the GNS/SnS2 microblocks serve as pillars to assemble into a 3D porous and interconnected framework, enabling fast electron/ion transport; while the GNS bridges the GNS/SnS2 microblocks into a flexible framework to provide satisfactorily mechanical strength and long-range conductivity. Moreover, the SnS2 nanocrystals, which chemically bond with GNS, provide sufficient active sites for Na storage and ensure the cycling stability. Consequently, this flexible 3D-GNS/SnS2 film exhibits excellent Na-storage performances, especially in terms of high areal capacity (2.45 mAh cm-2 ) and high rates with superior stability (385 mAh g-1 at 1.0 A g-1 over 1000 cycles with ≈100% retention).

        "abstract": "Germanium is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of its high theoretical specific capacity, high ion diffusivity, and rate capability. However, large volume changes and pulverization deteriorate the cycling performance. In this study, flexible electrospun germanium/carbon nanofibers (Ge/CNFs) were prepared via electrospinning followed by heat treatment. MoS2 nanoparticles were subsequently anchored on the flexible Ge/CNFs via hydrothermal synthesis. Flexible MoS2 anchored on Ge/CNFs (MoS2@Ge/CNFs) was used as a self-standing binder-free anode in an SIB. Because of the high electronic conductivity of CNFs and the many active sites of MoS2 nanoparticles, a high initial capacity of over 880 mAh/g was achieved at a current density of 0.1 A/g. Moreover, the flexible binder-free MoS2@Ge/CNFs exhibited an excellent C-rate performance with a reversible capacity of over 300 mAh/g at a current density of 2 A/g. Therefore, we demonstrated that flexible binder-free MoS2@Ge/CNFs are a promising electrode candidate for a high-performance rechargeable battery.",

        "abstract": "Conversion and alloying type negative electrodes attracted huge attention in the present research on lithium/sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs) due to the high capacity delivered. Among these, SnO2 is investigated intensively in LIBs due to high cyclability, low reaction potential, cost-effectiveness, and environmental friendliness. Most of the LIB electrodes are explored in SIBs too due to expected similar electrochemical performance. Though several LIB negative electrode materials successfully worked in SIBs, bare SnO2 shows very poor electrochemical performance in SIB. The reason for this difference is investigated here through combined in operando and ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). For this, the electrodes of SnO2 (space group P42/mnm synthesized via one-pot hydrothermal method) were cycled in Na-ion and Li-ion half-cells. The Na/SnO2 half-cell delivered a much lower discharge capacity than the Li/SnO2 half-cell. In addition, higher irreversibility was observed for Na/SnO2 half-cell during electrochemical investigations compared to that for Li/SnO2 half-cell. In operando XAS investigations on the Na/SnO2 half-cell confirms incomplete conversion and alloying reactions in the Na/SnO2 half-cell, resulting in poor electrochemical performance. The difference in the lithiation and sodiation mechanisms of SnO2 is discussed in detail.",

        "abstract": "The demand for energy storage supercapacitor devices has increased interest in completing all innovative technologies and renewable energy requirements. Here, we report a simple method of two polyoxomolybdate (H4[PVMo11O40] and H5[PV2Mo10O40]) doped polyindole (PIn) composites for electrochemical supercapacitors. The interactions between polyoxomolybdates and PIn were measured by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and powder XRD, and stability was measured by thermogravimetry. The field emission scanning microscopy (FESEM) was employed to investigate the morphology of the materials. The electrochemical measurements show that the PIn/PV2Mo10 electrode exhibits a higher capacitance of 198.09 F/g with an energy density of 10.19 Wh/kg and a power density of 198.54 W/kg at 0.2 A/g current density than the PIn/PVMo11 electrode. Both electrodes show a pseudocapacitance behavior due to the doping of redox-active polyoxomolybdates on the PIn surface and enhance the electrochemical properties. The electrodes’ capacitive nature was measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which shows that the PIn/PVMo11 electrode has a resistive nature within the electrode–electrode interface. Moreover, the PIn/PV2Mo10 electrode offers remarkable cycle stability, retaining ∼84% of its capacitance after 10,000 cycles (∼83% for the PIn/PVMo11 electrode). The higher specific capacitance, faster charge/discharge rates, and higher cycle stability make them promising electrodes in supercapacitors.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have become increasingly important as next-generation energy storage systems for application in large-scale energy storage. It is very crucial to develop an eco-friendly and green SIB technique with superior performance for sustainable future use. Replacing the conventional inorganic electrode materials with green and safe organic electrodes will be a promising approach. However, the poor electrochemical kinetics, unstable electrode-electrolyte interface, high solubility of the electrodes in the electrolyte, and large amount of conductive carbon present great challenges for organic SIBs. In this study, the issues of organic electrodes are addressed through atomic-level manipulation of these organic molecules using a series of ultrathin (Å-level) metal oxide coatings (Al2 O3 , ZnO, and TiO2 ). Uniform and precise coatings on the perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylicacid dianhydride by gas-phase atomic layer deposition technique shows a stable interphase, enhanced electrochemical kinetics (71C, 10 A g-1 ), and excellent stability (89%-500 cycles) compared to conventional organic electrode (70%-200 cycles). Further studies reveal that the chemical stability of the metal oxide coating layer plays a critical role in influencing the redox behavior, and improving kinetics of organic electrodes. This study opens a new avenue for developing high-energy organic SIBs with performance equivalent to inorganic counterparts.",

The PDCs were obtained by pre-pyrolysing peat at 300–800 °C, removing impurities with base–acid solution treatment and thereafter post-pyrolysing the materials at temperatures (T) from 1000 to 1500 °C. By modification of pre- and post-pyrolysis temperatures we obtained hard carbons with low surface areas, optimal carbonization degree and high electrochemical Na+ storage capacity in SIB half-cells. The best results were obtained when pre-pyrolysing peat at 450 °C, washing out the impurities with KOH and HCl solutions and then post-pyrolysing the obtained carbon-rich material at 1400 °C. All hard carbons were electrochemically characterized in half-cells (vs. Na/Na+) and capacities as high as 350 mA h g−1 at 1.5 V and 250 mA h g−1 in the plateau region (E < 0.2 V) were achieved at charging current density of 25 mA g−1 with an initial coulombic efficiency of 80%.",

The nanocomposite realized fast sodium-ion transport and thus preferable battery performances. Within the wide rate range of 0.5-50C, only a very small decrease in capacity from 124 to 120 mA h g-1 was observed. A high discharge capacity of 103 mA h g-1 (88.3% retention of the 1st cycle) was delivered even after 10 000 cycles at an ultrahigh rate of 50C without any obvious morphological change and without structural pulverization. Forming open channels for ion transport proved to contribute to such performance enhancement and therefore has the potential to become a universal model for the development of sustainable electrode materials in SIBs and other battery systems.",

Fast-growing families showed greater plasticity in allocating biomass to shoots at high nitrogen supply and to roots at low nitrogen supply than slow-growing families. Compared with the slow-growing families, short-term net ammonium uptake rate measured with an ion selective electrode was significantly greater in fast-growing families at high ammonium supply, but not at low supply.

In this study, we have successfully designed and synthesized a heteroaromatic molecule called 2,3,8,9,14,15-hexanol hexaazatrinaphthalene (HATN-6OH) with catechol/ortho-quinone coupling functional groups and HATN conjugated core structures. Through extensive analysis using density functional theory (DFT) calculation, ATR-FTIR, and Raman techniques, we have determined that the abundant coupling function groups and imine redox-active moieties on HATN-6OH enable a nine-electron transfer mechanism, resulting in a high specific capacity for sodium ion storage. Furthermore, the π-π coupling interactions and intermolecular hydrogen bond forces among HATN-6OH molecules contribute to its resilient structural and chemical stability during cycling. As a result, our HATN-6OH electrode exhibits remarkable specific capacity (554 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), excellent rate capability (202 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1), and stable long-term cycling performance (73% capacity retention after 3000 cycles at 10 A g-1) in SIBs.

By using a variety of electrochemical cycling protocols, synchrotron‐based X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC‐MS), and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H‐NMR) spectroscopy, capacity losses due to changes in the SEI layer during different open circuit pause times are investigated in nine different electrolyte solutions. It is shown that the amount of capacity lost depends on the interplay between the electrolyte chemistry and the thickness and stability of the SEI layer. The highest capacity loss is measured in NaPF6 in ethylene carboante mixed with diethylene carbonate electrolyte (i.e., 5 µAh h−1/2pause or 2.78 mAh g·h−1/2pause) while the lowest value is found in NaTFSI in ethylene carbonate mixed with dimethoxyethance electrolyte (i.e., 1.3 µAh h−1/2pause or 0.72 mAh g·h−1/2pause).",

        "abstract": "Careful development and optimization of negative electrode (anode) materials for Na-ion batteries (SIBs) are essential, for their widespread applications requiring a long-term cycling stability. BiFeO3 (BFO) with a LiNbO3-type structure (space group R3c) is an ideal negative electrode model system as it delivers a high specific capacity (770 mAh g-1), which is proposed through a conversion and alloying mechanism. In this work, BFO is synthesized via a sol-gel method and investigated as a conversion-type anode model-system for sodium-ion half-cells. As there is a difference in the first and second cycle profiles in the cyclic voltammogram, the operating mechanism of charge-discharge is elucidated using in operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy. In the first discharge, Bi is found to contribute toward the electrochemical activity through a conversion mechanism (Bi3+ → Bi0), followed by the formation of Na-Bi intermetallic compounds. Evidence for involvement of Fe in the charge storage mechanism through conversion of the oxide (Fe3+) form to metallic Fe and back during discharging/charging is also obtained, which is absent in previous literature reports. Reversible dealloying and subsequent oxidation of Bi and oxidation of Fe are observed in the following charge cycle. In the second discharge cycle, a reduction of Bi and Fe oxides is observed. Changes in the oxidation states of Bi and Fe, and the local coordination changes during electrochemical cycling are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the optimization of cycling stability of BFO is carried out by varying binders and electrolyte compositions. Based on that, electrodes prepared with the Na-carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binder are chosen for optimization of the electrolyte composition. BFO-CMC electrodes exhibit the best electrochemical performance in electrolytes containing fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as the additive. BFO-CMC electrodes deliver initial capacity values of 635 and 453 mAh g-1 in the Na-insertion (discharge) and deinsertion (charge) processes, respectively, in the electrolyte composition of 1 M NaPF6 in EC/DEC (1:1, v/v) with a 2% FEC additive. The capacity values stabilize around 10th cycle and capacity retention of 73% is observed after 60 cycles with respect to the 10th cycle charge capacity.",

The combination of multi-dimensional subunits offers not only a robust structure but also abundant pathways for fast electron/ion diffusion.

More competitively, the flexible MnS@CNWs/rGO anode exhibits an unprecedented long cycle life with a high reversible capacity of ∼150 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 10, 000 cycles.

        "abstract": "First-principles calculations were performed to study the electrochemical performance of M2TiC2 (M = Cr or Mo) and M2TiC2Tx (T = O, F or OH) used as anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). The O functionalized MXenes (Cr2TiC2O2 and Mo2TiC2O2) are found to be more stable than F and OH terminated systems. The diffusion performance of sodium in MXene materials is mainly affected by the functional groups. The lowest diffusion barrier of functionalized MXenes is about one order larger in magnitude than that of bare MXenes. Although the introduction of O-groups hinders the diffusion of sodium, it can greatly improve the theoretical storage capacities. Meanwhile, the diffusion paths and diffusion energy barriers of Na are affected by Na concentration effects, while the interactions between terminations have little effect. Furthermore, multiple layers of sodium atoms are found to be adsorbed between the layers of M2TiC2O2, thus significantly increasing the theoretical capacities. The theoretical sodium storage capacities of M2TiC2O2 monolayers reach 515.70 mA h g-1 (M = Cr) and 362.46 mA h g-1 (M = Mo) and the OCVs can approach 0.034 V (M = Cr) and 0.042 V (M = Mo). Therefore, Cr2TiC2O2 and Mo2TiC2O2 are expected to be promising anode materials for SIBs due to their excellent properties, such as good electronic conductivity, low sodium diffusion barrier, and high theoretical sodium storage capacity.",

        "abstract": "Bismuth (Bi) possesses an ultrahigh theoretical volume capacity (3800 mAh cm−3) and low embedding potential stimulated considerable attention as anodes for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, its practical application is still hampered by the huge volume variation during the charge/discharge process. To settle this issue, Bi@C nanosheet arrays (Bi@C‐NSA) are fabricated on copper foam via a facile galvanic replacement followed by in situ polymerization of dopamine and an annealing procedure. The carbon‐coated nanosheet array structure not only accommodates the volume expansion during cycling and maintains electrode stability, but also facilitates rapid electron/ion transport. Due to the unique structural design, this Bi@C‐NSA exhibits an impressive capacity of 315.72 mAh g−1 after 1500 cycles under 1 A g−1. Furthermore, a series of in situ/ex situ techniques reveal that this Bi@C‐NSA possesses superior reaction kinetics and undergoes a typical alloying/dealloying storage mechanism. Furthermore, Bi@C‐NSA also achieves commendable reversible capacity and cycling stability in a wide temperature range (0 °C–60 °C). Notably, the assembled Na3V2(PO4)3//Bi@C‐NSA full cell demonstrates a capacity of 325 mAh g−1 after 50 cycles at 0.05 A g−1, which promises for practical applications. This galvanic replacement strategy spearheads a way to prepare nanoarray electrodes and will accelerate the development of sodium‐ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) and sodium‐ion capacitors (SICs) are promising candidates for cost‐effective and large‐scale energy storage devices. However, sluggish kinetics and low capacity of traditional anode materials inhibit their practical applications. Herein, a novel design featuring a layer‐expanded MoS2 is presented that dual‐reinforced by hollow N, P‐codoped carbon as the inner supporter and surface groups abundant MXene as the outer supporter, resulting in a cross‐linked robust composite (NPC@MoS2/MXene). The hollow N, P‐codoped carbon effectively prevents agglomeration of MoS2 layers and facilitates shorter distances between the electrolyte and electrode. The conductive MXene outer surface envelops the NPC@MoS2 units inside, creating interconnected channels that enable efficient charge transfer and diffusion, ensuring rapid kinetics and enhanced electrode utilization. It exhibits a high reversible capacity of 453 mAh g−1, remarkable cycling stability, and exceptional rate capability with 54% capacity retention when the current density increases from 100 to 5000 mA g−1 toward SIBs. The kinetic mechanism studies reveal that the NPC@MoS2/MXene demonstrates a pseudocapacitance dominated hybrid sodiation/desodiation process. Coupled with active carbon (AC), the NPC@MoS2/MXene//AC SICs achieve both high energy density of 136 Wh kg−1 at 254 W kg−1 and high‐power density of 5940 W kg−1 at 27 Wh g−1, maintaining excellent stability.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are a promising candidate for large‐scale energy storage due to the low cost and abundant sodium resources. However, the formation of sodium dendrites on the surface of hard carbon (HC) anodes is the most intractable challenge for full cells during charging, leading to severe performance degradation and safety hazards. Here, a robust additive‐induced borate and fluoride‐rich interphase is constructed by introducing sodium difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB) as additive in the ether‐based electrolyte to relieve the performance deterioration for SIBs. NaDFOB can participate in the passivation process of electrolyte‐electrode interfaces through preferential oxidation and reduction of DFOB− to effectively restrain the growth of sodium dendrites. Moreover, the electrolyte decomposition and dissolution of transition metal ions are effectively inhibited. Benefiting from that, FeMn‐based Prussian blue (FeMnHCF) || HC full cell with a negative/positive capacity ratio (N/P ratio) of 1.09 displays a capacity retention of 82.1%, especially with a low N/P ratio of 0.96 the cell still demonstrates a stable Coulombic efficiency of over 99.9% after 500 cycles via using NaDFOB as additive. As a practical demonstration, the designed 18650 full cells display enhanced cycling stability with NaDFOB additive.

However, the high flammability of conventional electrolytes may pose serious safety threats and even explosions.

The strong hydrogen bond between S = O of 1,3,2-dioxathiolane-2,2-dioxide (DTD) and the α-H of SN endows the enhanced safety and compatibility of SN with Lewis bases. Meanwhile, the DTD participates in the inner Na+ sheath and weakens the coordination number of SN. The unique solvation configuration promotes the formation of robust gradient inorganic-rich electrode-electrolyte interphase, and merits stable cycling of half cells in a wide temperature range, with a capacity retention of 82.8% after 800 cycles (25 °C) and 86.3% after 100 cycles (60 °C).

Especially, the ever-present intercalation process in a large voltage range followed by the conversion reaction with extremely low potential was confirmed in FeP LIB, while it is mainly the conversion reaction for the sodium storage mechanism in FeP SIB. The insufficient conversion reaction profoundly limits the actual capacity to the expectedly respectable value. Accordingly, a graphene oxide modification strategy was proposed to increase the reversible capacity of FeP LIB/SIB by 99% and 132%, respectively.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been extensively studied owing to the abundance and low-price of Na resources. However, the infeasibility of graphite and silicon electrodes in sodium-ion storage makes it urgent to develop high-performance anode materials. Herein, α-MnSe nanorods derived from δ-MnO2 (δ-α-MnSe) are constructed as anodes for SIBs. It is verified that α-MnSe will be transferred into β-MnSe after the initial Na-ion insertion/extraction, and δ-α-MnSe undergoes typical conversion mechanism using a Mn-ion for charge compensation in the subsequent charge-discharge process. First-principles calculations support that Na-ion migration in defect-free α-MnSe can drive the lattice distortion to phase transition (alpha → beta) in thermodynamics and dynamics. The formed β-MnSe with robust lattice structure and small Na-ion diffusion barrier boosts great structure stability and electrochemical kinetics. Hence, the δ-α-MnSe electrode contributes excellent rate capability and superior cyclic stability with long lifespan over 1000 cycles and low decay rate of 0.0267% per cycle. Na-ion full batteries with a high energy density of 281.2 Wh·kg-1 and outstanding cyclability demonstrate the applicability of δ-α-MnSe anode.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) emerge as promising anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), heralding a new era of energy storage solutions. Despite their potential, the mechanisms underlying their performance enhancement and susceptibility to failure in ether‐based electrolytes remain elusive. This study delves into these aspects, employing CoS2 electrodes as a case in point to elucidate the phenomena. The investigation reveals that CoS2 undergoes a unique irreversible and progressive solid–liquid–solid phase transition from its native state to sodium polysulfides (NaPSs), and ultimately to a Cu1.8S/Co composite, accompanied by a gradual morphological transformation from microspheres to a stable 3D porous architecture. This reconstructed 3D porous structure is pivotal for its exceptional Na+ diffusion kinetics and resilience to cycling‐induced stress, being the main reason for ultrastable cycling and ultrahigh rate capability. Nonetheless, the CoS2 electrode suffers from an inevitable cycle life termination due to the microshort‐circuit induced by Na metal corrosion and separator degradation. Through a comparative analysis of various TMCs, a predictive framework linking electrode longevity is established to electrode potential and Gibbs free energy. Finally, the cell failure issue is significantly mitigated at a material level (graphene encapsulation) and cell level (polypropylene membrane incorporation) by alleviating the NaPSs shuttling and microshort‐circuit.",

Cr2 Se3 exhibits spontaneous antiparallel alignment of magnetic moments. Mo2+ doping is employed to regulate the electron spin states of Cr2 Se3 . Moreover, the MoSe2 and Cr2 Se3 heterojunctions induce a lattice mismatch at the heterostructure interface, resulting in spin-polarized states or localized magnetic moments at the interface, potentially contributing to spin-polarized surface capacitance. MoSe2 /Cr2 Se3 @N-HCSs demonstrate a high capacity of 498 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 with good cycling stability (capacity of 405 mAh g-1 and a coulombic efficiency of 99.8% after 1000 cycles). Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations simulate the accumulation of spin-polarized charges at the MoSe2 /Cr2 Se3 @N-HCSs heterojunction interface, dependent on the surface electron density of the antiferromagnetic Cr2 Se3 and the surface spin polarization near the Fermi level. After regulating the electron spin states through Mo-doping, the band gap of the material decreases. These significant findings provide novel insights into the design and synthesis of electrode materials with exceptional performance characteristics for batteries.",

        "abstract": "The low ion transport is a major obstacle for low‐temperature (LT) sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a core‐shell structure of bismuth (Bi) nanospheres coated with carbon (Bi@C) is constructed by utilizing a novel Bi‐based complex (1,4,5,8‐naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride as the ligand) as the precursor, which provides an effective template to fabricate Bi‐based anodes. At −40°C, the Bi@C anode achieves a high capacity, which is equivalent to 96% of that at 25°C, benefitting from the core‐shell nanostructured engineering and Na+‐ether‐solvent cointercalation process. The special Na+‐diglyme cointercalation behavior may effectively reduce the activation energy and accelerate the Na+ diffusion kinetics, enabling the excellent low‐temperature performance of the Bi@C electrode. As expected, the fabricated Na3V2(PO4)3//Bi@C full‐cell delivers impressive rechargeability in the ether‐based electrolyte at −40°C. Density functional theory calculations and electrochemical tests also reveal the fast reaction kinetic mechanism at LT, thanks to a much lower diffusion energy barrier (167 meV) and a lower reaction activation energy (32.2 kJ mol−1) of Bi@C anode in comparison with that of bulk Bi. This work provides a rational design of Bi‐based electrodes for rechargeable SIBs under extreme conditions.",

        "abstract": "Conversion-type electrode materials have gained massive research attention in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), but their limited reversibility hampers practical use. Herein, we report a bifunctional nanoreactor to boost highly reversible sodium-ion storage, wherein a record-high reversible degree of 85.65% is achieved for MoS2 anodes. Composed of nitrogen-doped carbon-supported single atom Mn (NC-SAMn), this bifunctional nanoreactor concurrently confines active materials spatially and catalyzes reaction kinetics. In-situ/ex-situ characterizations including spectroscopy, microscopy, and electrochemistry, combined with theoretical simulations containing density functional theory and molecular dynamics, confirm that the NC-SAMn nanoreactors facilitate the electron/ion transfer, promote the distribution and interconnection of discharging products (Na2S/Mo), and reduce the Na2S decomposition barrier.As a result, the nanoreactor-promoted MoS2 anodes exhibit ultra-stable cycling with a capacity retention of 99.86% after 200 cycles in the full cell. This work demonstrates the superiority of bifunctional nanoreactors with two-dimensional confined and catalytic effects, providing a feasible approach to improve the reversibility for a wide range of conversion-type electrode materials, thereby enhancing the application potential for long-cycled SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are a promising electrochemical energy storage system; however, their practical application is hindered by the sluggish kinetics and interfacial instability of anode-active materials. Here, to circumvent these issues, we proposed the multiscale interface engineering of S-doped TiO2 electrodes with minor sulfur/carbon inlaying (S/C@sTiO2), where the electrode-electrolyte interface (SEI) and electrode-current collector interface (ECI) are tuned to improve the Na-storage performance. It is found that the S dopant greatly promotes the Na+ diffusion kinetics. Moreover, the ether electrolyte generates much less NaF in the cycled electrode, but relatively richer NaF in the SEI in comparison to fluoroethylene carbonate-contained ester electrolyte, leading to a thin (9 nm), stable, and kinetically favorable SEI film. More importantly, the minor sodium polysulfide intermediates chemically interact with the Cu current collector to form a Cu2S interface between the electrode and the Cu foil. The conductive tree root-like Cu2S ECI serves not only as active sites to boost the specific capacity but also as a 3D \"second current collector\" to reinforce the electrode and improve the Na+ reaction kinetics. The synergy of S-doping and optimized SEI and ECI realizes large specific capacity (464.4 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), ultrahigh rate capability (305.8 mAh g-1 at 50 A g-1), and ultrastable cycling performance (91.5% capacity retention after 3000 cycles at 5 A g-1).

        "abstract": "3D composite electrodes have shown extraordinary promise as high mass loading electrode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). However, they usually show poor rate performance due to the sluggish Na+ kinetics at the heterointerfaces of the composites. Here, a 3D MXene-reduced holey graphene oxide (MXene-RHGO) composite electrode with Ti─O─C bonding at 2D heterointerfaces of MXene and RHGO is developed. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the built-in electric fields (BIEFs) are enhanced by the formation of bridged interfacial Ti─O─C bonding, that lead to not only faster diffusion of Na+ at the heterointerfaces but also faster adsorption and migration of Na+ on the MXene surfaces. As a result, the 3D composite electrodes show impressive properties for fast Na+ storage. Under high current density of 10 mA cm-2, the 3D MXene-RHGO composite electrodes with high mass loading of 10 mg cm-2 achieve a strikingly high and stable areal capacity of 3 mAh cm-2, which is same as commercial LIBs and greatly exceeds that of most reported SIBs electrode materials.

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have garnered significant interest as one of the most promising energy suppliers for power grid energy storage. However, the poor electrode/electrolyte interfacial stability leads to continual electrolyte decomposition and transition metal dissolution, resulting in rapid performance degradation of SIBs. In this work, we propose a strategy integrating multiple functional bonds to regulate electrode/electrolyte interphase by triple-coupling of succinonitrile (SN), sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) and fluorinated ethylene carbonate (FEC). Theoretical calculation and experiment results show that the solvation structure of Na+ and ClO4- is effectively reconfigured by the solvated FEC, SN and PF6- in PC-based carbonate electrolyte. The newly developed electrolyte demonstrates increased Na+-FEC coordination, weakened interaction of Na+-PC and participation of SN and PF6- anions in solvation, resulting in the formation of a conformal interfacial layer comprising of sodium oxynitrides (NaNxOy), sodium fluoride (NaF) and phosphorus oxide compounds (NaPxOy). Consequently, a 3 Ah pouch full cell of hard carbon//NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 exhibits an excellent capacity retention of 90.4% after 1000 cycles. Detailed postmortem analysis of interface chemistry is further illustrated by multiple characterization methods.

However, their physical and electrochemical properties of water sensitivity, sluggish Na+ transport kinetics, and irreversible multiple‐phase translations hinder the practical application. Here, a concept of surface lattice‐matched engineering is proposed based on in situ spinel interfacial reconstruction to design a spinel coating P2/P3 heterostructure cathode material with enhanced air stability, rate, and cycle performance. The novel structure and its formation process are verified by transmission electron microscopy and in situ high‐temperature X‐ray diffraction. The electrode exhibits an excellent rate performance with the highly reversible phase transformation demonstrated by in situ charging/discharging X‐ray diffraction. Additionally, even after a rigorous water sensitivity test, the electrode materials still retain almost the same superior electrochemical performance as the fresh sample. The results show that the surface spinel phase can play a vital role in preventing the ingress of water molecules, improving transport kinetics, and enhancing structural integrity for NaxTMO2 cathodes.

The research focus of SIBs is usually directed toward electrode materials, while the binder as an important component is rarely investigated. Herein, a cross-linked sodium alginate (SA)/graphene oxide (GO) binder is judiciously designed to serve as a robust artificial interphase on the surface of both anode and cathode of SIBs. Benefiting from the cross-linking continuous network structure as well as the highly hydrophilic nature, the SA-GO binder possesses a large tensile strength of 197.7 Mpa and a high ionic conductivity of 0.136 mS cm-1 , superior to pure SA (93.8 Mpa, 0.025 mS cm-1 ). Moreover, the structural design of SA-GO binder exhibits a strong binding ability to guarantee structural integrity during cycling. To demonstrate its effectiveness, polyanion-type phosphates (e.g., Na3 (VO)2 (PO4 )2 F) and chalcogenides (e.g., MoS2 , VS2 ) are adopted as cathode and anode materials of SIBs, respectively.

        "abstract": "The exploitation of electrode materials with ability to balance capacity and kinetics between cathode and anode is a challenge for sodium-ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs). Mn-based anode materials are limited by poor electrical conductivity, sluggish reaction kinetics, large volume variation, weak cycling stability, and inferior reversible capacity. Herein, MnS nanocubes encapsulated in S-doped porous carbon matrix (MSC) with strong sulfur-bridged bond interactions (CSMn) are successfully synthesized by solvent-free tactics. The CSMn bonds generated between MnS and carbon significantly inhibit the aggregation of nanostructural MnS cubes, restrict the volume expansion, and stabilize the nanostructure, which improves the Na+ storage reversibility and stability. Moreover, S-doped porous carbon enhances the electrical conductivity and electrons/ions diffusion rate, which boosts a fast kinetic reaction. As expected, MSC anode presents an outstanding reversible capacity of 600 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 and a long-term stable capacity of 357 mAh g-1 for 1000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g-1 in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The as-assembled SIHCs deliver a high energy density of 109 W h kg-1 and a high power output of 98 W kg-1 , with 88% capacity retention at 2 A g-1 after 2000 cycles and practical applications (55 LEDs can be lighted for 10 min).",

        "abstract": "Titanates have been widely reported as anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, their wide temperature suitability and cycle life remain fundamental issues that hinder their practical application. Herein, a novel hollow Na2Ti3O7 microsphere (H‐NTO) with a unique chemically bonded NTO/C(N) interface is reported. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the NTO/C(N) interface stabilizes the crystal structure, and the optimized interface enables the H‐NTO anode to stably operate for 80 000 cycles in a conventional ester electrolyte with negligible capacity loss. Optimizing the electrolyte allows the H‐NTO electrode to cycle stably for 200 calendar days without capacity degradation at −40 °C. The excellent cycling stability is attributed to the NTO/C(N) interface and the stable solid electrolyte interphase formed by the highly adaptable electrolyte/electrode interface. Titanate exhibits solvent co‐intercalation behavior in ether‐based electrolytes, and its robust structure ensures that it can adapt to large volume changes at low temperatures. This study provides a unique perspective on the long‐cycle mechanism of titanate anodes and highlights the critical importance of manipulating the interfacial chemistry in SIBs, including the material and electrode/electrolyte interfaces.",

Herein, the robust 2D VS2/ Ti3C2Tx MXene nanostructures with the strong Ti─S covalent bond synthesized by a one‐pot self‐assembly approach are developed. The strong interfacial interaction renders the material of good structural durability and enhanced reaction kinetics. Meanwhile, the enlarged and few‐layered MXene nanosheets can be easily obtained according to this interaction, providing a conductive network for sufficient electrolyte penetration and rapid charge transfer. As predicted, the VS2/MXene nanostructures exhibit an extremely low sodium diffusion barrier confirmed by DFT calculations and small charge transfer impedance evidenced by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. Therefore, the SIBs based on the VS2/MXene electrode present first‐class electrochemical performance with the ultrahigh average initial columbic efficiency of 95.08% and excellent sodium‐ion storage capacity of 424.6 mAh g−1 even at 10 A g−1.

        "abstract": "Metallic phase molybdenum sulfide (1T‐MoS2) is considered as an attractive electrode material for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) owing to its abundant active sites, metallic conductivity and high theoretical capacity. Unfortunately, the thermodynamic unstable characteristic under natural conditions makes 1T‐MoS2 difficult to synthesize directly, which greatly hinders its further applications. Herein, an electron modulated and phosphate radical stabilized strategy is employed to construct stable 1T‐rich MoS2 (1T‐P‐MoS2). The PO43− groups are intercalated into MoS2 via a simple one‐step synthesis process, which enlarges the interlayer spacings and improves the insertion/extraction kinetics of Na+. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experiments demonstrate that the PO43− can give partial electrons to Mo upon PO43− intercalation, which triggers the reorganization of Mo 4d orbitals, resulting in a spontaneous phase transition of MoS2 from 2H to 1T phase, thereby enhancing the electrical conductivity of MoS2. The obtained 1T‐P‐MoS2 exhibits ultra‐fast charged properties (up to 277.1 mAh g−1 at 40 A g−1, discharged/charged within 25 s) and excellent cycling performance (up to 498.9 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles at 1 A g−1).

Hard carbons (HCs) are considered as the leading candidate anode materials for SIBs, however, the primary challenge of slow charge‐transfer kinetics at the low potential region (<0.1 V) remains unresolved till date, and the underlying structure–performance correlation is under debate. Herein, ultrafast sodium storage in the whole‐voltage‐region (0.01–2 V), with the Na+ diffusion coefficient enhanced by 2 orders of magnitude (≈10–7 cm2 s–1) through rationally deploying the physical parameters of HCs using a ZnO‐assisted bulk etching strategy is reported. It is unveiled that the Na+ adsorption energy (Ea) and diffusion barrier (Eb) are in a positive and negative linear relationship with the carbon p‐band center, respectively, and balance of Ea and Eb is critical in enhancing the charge‐storage kinetics. The charge‐storage mechanism in HCs is evidenced through comprehensive in(ex) situ techniques. The as prepared HCs microspheres deliver a record high rate performance of 107 mAh g–1 @ 50 A g–1 and unprecedented electrochemical performance at extremely low temperature (426 mAh g–1 @ −40 °C).",

This performance is much more superior to that of the previously reported Fe‐based anode materials, which is attributed to their amorphous structure that alleviates volume expansion of electrode, 2D nature that facilitates electrons/ions transfer, and the S/Se double anions that offer more reaction sites and stabilize the amorphous structure. Such a 2D amorphous strategy provides a fertile platform for structural engineering of other electrode materials, making a more secure energy prospect closer to a reality.",

Nanoscale design coupled with a conductive carbon skeleton can simultaneously mitigate the above obstacles to obtain enhanced structural stability and faster electrode reaction kinetics.

        "abstract": "The development of stable and efficient electrode materials is imperative and also indispensable for further commercialization of sodium/potassium-ion batteries (SIBs/PIBs) and new detrimental issues such as proton intercalation arise when utilizing aqueous electrolytes. Herein the electrochemical performance of the Cu4Se4 nanosheet was determined for both organic and aqueous SIBs and PIBs. By means of density functional theory calculation, Na+, K+ and H+ intercalations onto both sides of the Cu4Se4 nanosheet were revealed. The Cu4Se4 nanosheet well maintains its metallic electronic conductivity and the changes in lateral lattice parameters are within 4.66% during the whole Na+/K+ intercalation process for both SIBS and PIBs. The theoretical maximum Na/K storage capacity of 188.07 mA h g-1 can be achieved by stabilized second-layer adsorption of Na+/K+. The migration barriers of Na and K atoms on the Cu4Se4 nanosheet are 0.270 and 0.173 eV, respectively. It was discovered that Na/K- intercalation in the first layer is accompanied by a first-order surface phase transition, resulting in an intercalation voltage plateau of 0.659/0.756 V, respectively. The region of the two-surface phase coexistence for PIBs, is shifted toward a lower coverage when compared with that for SIBs. The partially protonated Cu4Se4 nanosheet (HxCu4Se4, x ≤ 10/9) was revealed to be structurally and thermodynamically stable. While the partially protonated Cu4Se4 nanosheet is favorable in acidic electrolytes (pH = 0) when protons and Na/K ions compete, we showed that Na+/K+ intercalated products may be preferred over H+ at low coverages in alkali electrolyte (pH = 14). However, the proton intercalation substantially decreases the battery capacity in aqueous SIBs and PIBs. Our work not only identifies the promising performance of Cu4Se4 nanosheets as an electrode material of SIBs and PIBs, but also provides a computational method for aqueous metal-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "The pursuit of high-performance batteries has propelled the investigation into advanced materials and design methodologies. Herein, the yolk-shell MnSe/ZnSe heterojunction encapsulated in hollow carbontubes (MnSe/ZnSe@HCTs) is prepared as a prospective electrode material for sodium/potassium batteries. The band structure in the heterojunction is methodically adjusted and regulated by intentionally utilizing Mn with unpaired electrons in the 3d orbital. The ZnSe shell confer effectively mitigates volumetric expansion challenges inherent in ions insertion/extraction processes and 1D carbontubular conductive substrate avert the aggregation of MnSe/ZnSe nanoparticles. Concurrently, the heterojunctions implantation induces sublattice distortion and charge redistribution, enriching active sites and regulating band structure. The selenium vacancies within these heterojunctions contribute to the provision of abundant active sites, thereby promoting efficient ions insertion/extraction. In sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), MnSe/ZnSe@HCTs present a superior capacity of 475 mA hg-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and sustains a capacity of 408.5 mAh g-1 even after 1000 cycles. In potassium-ion batteries (KIBs), MnSe/ZnSe@HCTs deliver a higher specific capacity of 422 mAh g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1 and maintain a high coulombic efficiency of 99% after 1000 cycles. The yolk-shell structured MnSe/ZnSe heterojunction demonstrates excellent electrode properties for high-performance sodium/potassium batteries, holding significant promise for future energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "The abundant reserve and low cost of sodium have provoked tremendous evolution of Na-ion batteries (SIBs) in the past few years, but their performances are still limited by either the specific capacity or rate capability. Attempts to pursue high rate ability with maintained high capacity in a single electrode remains even more challenging. Here, an elaborate self-branched 2D SnS2 (B-SnS2) nanoarray electrode is designed by a facile hot bath method for Na storage. This interesting electrode exhibits areal reversible capacity of ca. 3.7 mAh cm-2 (900 mAh g-1) and rate capability of 1.6 mAh cm-2 (400 mAh g-1) at 40 mA cm-2 (10 A g-1). Improved extrinsic pseudocapacitive contribution is demonstrated as the origin of fast kinetics of an alloying-based SnS2 electrode. Sodiation dynamics analysis based on first-principles calculations, ex-situ HRTEM, in situ impedance, and in situ Raman technologies verify the S-edge effect on the fast Na+ migration and reversible and sensitive structure evolution during high-rate charge/discharge. The excellent alloying-based pseudocapacitance and unsaturated edge effect enabled by self-branched surface nanoengineering could be a promising strategy for promoting development of SIBs with both high capacity and high rate response.",

        "abstract": "Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are considered one of the most promising large‐scale and low‐cost energy storage systems due to the abundance and low price of sodium. Herein, hard carbons from a sustainable biomass feedstock (vine shoots) were synthesized via a simple two‐step carbonization process at different highest temperatures to be used as anodes in SIBs. The hard carbon produced at 1200 °C delivered the highest reversible capacity (270 mAh g–1 at 0.03 A g–1, with an acceptable initial coulombic efficiency of 71%) since a suitable balance between the pseudographitic domains growth and the retention of microporosity, defects, and functional groups was achieved. A prominent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 97% over 315 cycles was also attained. Comprehensive characterization unraveled a three‐stage sodium storage mechanism based on adsorption, intercalation, and filling of pores. A remarkable specific capacity underestimation of up to 38% was also found when a two‐electrode half‐cell configuration was employed to measure the rate performance. To avoid this systematic error caused by the counter/reference electrode polarization, we strongly recommend the use of a three‐electrode setup or a full‐cell configuration to correctly evaluate the anode response at moderate and high current rates.",

        "abstract": "Advanced high‐energy‐density sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are inseparable from cathode materials with high specific capacities. Layered manganese‐rich oxides (NaxMnO2, 0.6 ≤ x ≤1) are promising cathode materials owing to their ease of intercalation and extraction of a considerable amount of sodium ions. However, lattice interactions, especially electrostatic repulsive forces and anisotropic stresses, are usually caused by deep desodiatin/sodiation process, resulting in intragranular cracks and capacity degradation in SIBs. Here, boron ions are introduced into the layered structure to build up B─O─Mn bonds. The regulated electronic structure in Na0.637B0.038MnO2 (B‐NMO) materials inhibits the deformation of MnO6 octahedra, which finally achieves a gentle structural transition during the deep sodiation process. B‐NMO electrode exhibits a high capacity (141 mAh g–1) at 1 C with a capacity retention of 81% after 100 cycles. Therefore, anchoring boron to manganese‐rich materials inhibits the detrimental structural evolution of deep sodiation and can be used to obtain excellent cathode materials for SIBs.",

Herein, a carbon-decorated MoS2/CoS heterostructure on carbon cloth (MoS2/CoS@CC) as a free-standing anode for SIBs was synthesized via a facile growth-carbonization strategy. In the composite, the generated built-in electric field at MoS2 and CoS heterointerfaces is beneficial for elevating the electron conductivity, thus expediting the Na-ion transport rate. Moreover, different redox potentials between MoS2 and CoS can effectively mitigate the mechanical strain induced by repeated Na+ de-/intercalation, thus ensuring the structural integrity. In addition, the carbon skeleton derived from the carbonization of glucose can enhance the conductivity of the electrode and maintain the structural integrity. Consequently, the resulting MoS2/CoS@CC electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 605 mA h g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 after 100 cycles, and prominent rate performance (366 mA h g-1 at 8.0 A g-1).

However, low electrical conductivity and dissolution in organic liquid electrolytes hinder their further development. Herein, MXene/organics heterostructures are designed to address the problems of organic electrodes via a scalable and simple electrostatic self-assembly strategy. Under the effect of the electrostatic interaction, organic cathode material, 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), is tightly attached to MXene nanosheets. Owing to the high electronic conductivity and special two-dimensional (2D) structure of MXene nanosheets, the issues of PTCDA cathode are effectively relieved. When applied in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), the MXene@PTCDA heterostructure exhibits significantly enhanced rate capability and cycling performance than bare PTCDA. The heterostructures proposed here can be applied to other (K, Zn, Al, Mg, Ca, etc.) battery systems. In addition to energy storage and conversion, the heterostructures can be also extended to many fields such as catalysis, sensors, electronics, optics, membranes, semiconductors, biomedicines, etc.",

Yet the underlying physicochemical mechanism of poor reaction reversibility is still a controversial issue. Herein, by using in situ transmission electron microscope and in situ X-ray diffraction, we demonstrate the irreversible conversion of NiCoP@C is caused by the rapid migration of P in carbon layer and preferential formation of isolated Na3P during discharge. By modifying the carbon coating layer, the migration of Ni/Co/P atoms is inhibited, thus the improvement of ICE and cycle stability is realized. The inhibiting of fast atom migration which induces component separation and rapid performance degradation might be applied to a wide range of electrode materials, and guides the development of advanced SIBs.",

Here, a covalent organic polymer (COP) based material (denoted as CityU‐9) is designed and synthesized by integrating multiple redox motifs (benzoquinone and thioether), improved conductivity (sulfur induction), and intrinsic insolubility (rigid skeleton).

The graphitic carbon‐coated ZnPS3 electrode exhibits excellent high‐rate capability and long‐term cyclability. The superior electrochemical properties can be attributed to high electrical conductivity, high Li ion mobility, and high reversibility and structural stability derived from the graphitic carbon‐coated nanoparticles.

Vat photopolymerization (VPP) 3D printing process is employed to manufacture gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), while direct ink writing process is used to prepare positive electrodes. The sodium-ion chemistry has proven to be an adequate substitute to lithium-ion due to the availability of resources and their potential lower production cost and enhanced safety. Three-dimensional printing technologies have the potential to revolutionize the production of shape-conformable batteries with intricate geometries that have been demonstrated to increase the specific surface area of the electrode and ion diffusion, thus leading to improved power performances. This study shows the preparation of composite UV-photocurable resins with different polymer matrix-to-liquid electrolyte ratios, designed to act as GPEs once printed via VPP. The impact of the liquid electrolyte ratio within the GPEs is thoroughly examined through a variety of electrochemical techniques. The exposure time printing parameter is optimized to ensure adequate print accuracy of the GPE. Using the optimized resin composition as material feedstock, shape-conformable 3D printed GPE exhibiting an ionic conductivity of 3.3 × 10−3 S·cm−1 at room temperature and a stability window up to 4.8 V vs. Na0/Na+ is obtained. In parallel, a composite ink loaded with Na0.44MnO2 and conductive additives is developed to 3D print via direct ink writing positive electrodes. After demonstrating the functionality of the independent 3D printed components in SIBs, the last part of this work is focused on combining the 3D printed Na0.44MnO2 electrode and the 3D printed GPE into the same battery cell to pave the way towards the manufacturing of a complete 3D printed battery thanks to different additive manufacturing processes.",

Herein, the Fe3O4 nanoparticles, which are well encapsulated by carbon nanolayers, are uniformly dispersed on the graphene basal plane (named Fe3O4/C@G) to be used as the anode for SIBs. The existence of graphene can reduce the size of Fe3O4/C nanoparticles from 150 to 80 nm and greatly boost charge transport capability of electrode, resulting in an obvious size decrease of superparamagnetic Fe nanoparticles generated from the conversion reaction from 5 to 2 nm. Importantly, the ultra‐small superparamagnetic Fe nanoparticles (≈2 nm) can induce a strong spin‐polarized surface capacitance effect at operating temperatures ranging from −40 to 60 °C, thus achieving highly efficient Na‐ion transport and storage in a wide operation‐temperature range. Consequently, the Fe3O4/C@G anode shows high capacity, excellent fast‐charging capability, and cycling stability ranging from −40 to 60 °C in half/full cells. This work demonstrates the viability of Fe3O4 as anode for wide operation‐temperature SIBs and reveals that spin‐polarized surface capacitance effects can promote Na‐ion storage over a wide operation temperature range.",

        "abstract": "Binder-free electrodes offer a great opportunity for developing high-performance sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) aiming at the application in energy storage devices. Tin selenide (SnSe) is considered to be a promising anode material for SIBs owing to its high theoretical capacity (780 mA h g-1). In this work, a SnSe nanosheet array (SnSe NS) on a carbon cloth is prepared using a vacuum thermal evaporation method. The as-prepared SnSe NS electrode does not have metal current collectors, binders, or any conductive additives. In comparison with the electrode of SnSe blocky particles (SnSe BP), the SnSe NS electrode delivers a higher initial charge capacity of 713 mA h g-1 at a current density of 0.1C and maintains a higher charge capacity of 410 mA h g-1 after 50 cycles. Furthermore, the electrochemical behaviors of the SnSe NS electrode are determined via pseudocapacitance and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements, indicating a faster kinetic process of the SnSe NS electrode compared to that of the SnSe BP. Operando X-ray diffraction measurements prove that the SnSe NS exhibits better phase reversibility than the SnSe BP. After the cycles, the SnSe NS electrode still maintains its particular structure. This work provides a feasible method to prepare SnSe nanostructures with high capacity and improved sodium ion diffusion ability.",

        "abstract": "Na-ion batteries (SIBs) are emerging as a promising alternative to Li-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage in light of abundant Na resources and their low cost. Development of appropriate electrode materials that can conquer some critical issues such as low theoretical storage capacity and sluggish redox kinetics resulting from the larger radius of Na is urgently needed for their practical applications. In this work, boron-rich 2D BxN (x = 2, 3, and 5) has been explored as promising anode materials for high-performance SIBs based on density functional theory calculations. BxN electrodes exhibit moderate affinity toward Na-ions with adsorption energies of -0.41 to -1.21 eV, which allows stable Na-ion intercalation without the formation of metal dendrites. Moreover, both B3N and B5N deliver low diffusion barriers (0.28 and 0.08 eV) for Na-ion migration, guaranteeing a high charging/discharging rate. More importantly, these BxN anodes exhibit not only a remarkably high theoretical capacity of 1129-1313 mA h g-1 but also a low open-circuit voltage (0.45-0.87 V), which is important to achieve high energy density. AIMD simulations have confirmed the excellent cyclability of BxN electrodes during reversible lithiation/delithiation. These results suggested that the BxN electrode could be used as a new lightweight SIB anode with high capacity, cyclability, and desired rate performance.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are emerging as power sources for large-scale storage owing to their abundant and inexpensive sodium (Na) source, but their limited energy density hinders their commercialization. High-capacity anode materials, such as antimony (Sb), which are potential energy boosters for SIBs, suffer from battery degradation owing to large-volume-changes and structural instability. The rational design of bulk Sb-based anodes to enhance the initial reversibility and electrode density inevitably requires atomic- and microscale-considered internal/external buffering or passivation layers. However, unsuitable buffer engineering causes electrode degradation and lowers energy density. Herein, the rationally designed intermetallic inner and outer oxide buffers for bulk Sb anodes are reported. The two chemistries in the synthesis process provide an atomic-scale aluminum (Al) buffer within the dense microparticles and an external mechanically stabilizing dual oxide layer. The prepared nonporous bulk Sb anode maintained excellent reversible capacity at a high current density and Na-ion full battery evaluations with Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) showing negligible capacity decay over 100 cycles. The demonstrated buffer designs for commercially favorable micro-sized Sb and intermetallic AlSb shed light on the stabilization of high-capacity or large-volume-change electrode materials for various metal-ion rechargeable batteries.",

The rational construction of NiS2 -MoS2 heterostructures induces abundant interfaces and unique ion diffusion channels, which render fast electrochemical kinetics and superior reversible capacities for high-performance SIBs.

This work describes the synthesis of a series of sodium borate salts, with electrochemical studies revealing that Na[B(hfip)4]⋅DME (hfip=hexafluoroisopropyloxy, OiPrF) and Na[B(pp)2] (pp=perfluorinated pinacolato, O2C2(CF3)4) have excellent electrochemical performance. The [B(pp)2]− anion also exhibits a high tolerance to air and water. Both electrolytes give more stable electrode‐electrolyte interfaces than conventionally used NaPF6, as demonstrated by impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, they give greater cycling stability and comparable capacity to NaPF6 for SIBs, as shown in commercial pouch cells.",

        "abstract": "Bismuth (Bi) has emerged as a promising anode material for fast-charging and long-cycling sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, its dramatically volumetric variations during cycling will undesirably cause the pulverization of active materials, severely limiting the electrochemical performance of Bi-based electrodes. Constructing hollow nanostructures is recognized as an effective way to resolve the volume expansion issues of alloy-type anodes but remains a great challenge for metallic bismuth. Here, we report a facile iodine-ion-assisted galvanic replacement approach for the synthesis of Bi nanotubes (NTs) for high-rate, long-term and high-capacity sodium storage. The hollow tubular structure effectively alleviates the structural strain during sodiation/desodiation processes, resulting in excellent structural stability; the thin wall and large surface area enable ultrafast sodium ion transport. Benefiting from the structural merits, the Bi NT electrode exhibits extraordinary rate capability (84% capacity retention at 150 A g-1) and outstanding cycling stability (74% capacity retention for 65,000 cycles at 50 A g-1), which represent the best rate performance and longest cycle life among all reported anodes for SIBs. Moreover, when coupled with the Na3(VOPO4)2F cathode in full cells, this electrode also demonstrates excellent cycling performance, showing the great promise of Bi NTs for practical application. A combination of advanced research techniques reveals that the excellent performance originates from the structural robustness of the Bi NTs and the fast electrochemical kinetics during cycling.",

        "abstract": "Fast charging rate and large energy storage are key requirements for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in electric vehicles. Developing electrode materials with high volumetric and gravimetric capacity that could be operated at a high rate is the most challenging problem. In this work, a general multi-interface strategy toward densified carbon materials with enhanced comprehensive electrochemical performance for Li/Na-ion batteries is proposed. The mixture of graphene oxide and sucrose solution is sprayed into a water/oil system and furtherly carbonized to get graphene/hard carbon spheres (GHSs). In this material, abundant ingenious internal interfaces between the crystalline graphene and the carbon matrix are created inside the hard carbon spheres. The constructed interfaces can not only work as a pathway for the escape of volatile gas generated during sucrose pyrolysis to prevent the formation of abundant pores, which leads high packing density of 0.910 g cm-3 and low surface area of 13.3 m2  g-1 , but can also provide a conductive \"highway\" for ions and electrons. When used as the anode material for both LIBs and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), the GHS shows the high gravimetric/volumetric reversible capacities, high-rate performance, and low temperature properties simultaneously, implying the great potential application in practical LIBs and SIBs.",

Herein, a biomass jute fiber precursor HC anode (JPC) with varying porosity is reported for the first time as a low-cost and sustainable high-performance HC anode for SIBs and PIBs. Direct carbonization results in micro-meso porous HC (JPC-D), and micro-wave pretreated jute fiber results in ultramicroporous HC (JPC-M). The mesoporosity generated in JPC-D during synthesis outperforms the ultramicroporous JPC-M with a high reversible capacity of 328 mAh g-1 (iCE = 66%) at a current density of 30 mA g-1 (0.1C) with superior capacity retention of 84% after 100 cycles in SIBs. The Na+ ion and K+ ion storage in HCs, especially at lower voltages, shows distinct storage mechanisms that depend on the morphology and porosity of the material. JPC-D contributed 39% of its total capacity through the plateau region capacity (PRC), suggesting more pore filling from hierarchical porosity in SIBs. JPC-D and JPC-M exhibit more insertion-based capacity than pore-filling processes in PIBs. The presence of inorganic impurities (Ca, Si, Al, and Fe) encapsulated in the carbon structure plays a critical role in developing mesopores. The yield (%) of HC from direct carbonization per kilogram of jute is ∼34%, which makes it cheaper than HC from sugar-based precursors and 1.5 times more affordable than other biomass-derived HC. The jute-based micro-mesoporous HC is a novel, cost-effective, sustainable approach to designing HC for a PRC-based battery-type anode in SIBs and PIBs.",

        "abstract": "The high demand for renewable and clean energy has driven the exploration of advanced energy storage systems. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered to be potential substitutes for Li-ion batteries (LIBs) because they are manufactured from raw materials that are cheap, less toxic, and abundantly available. Recent developments have demonstrated that two-dimensional (2D) materials have gained increasing interest as electrode candidates for efficient SIBs because of their enormous surface area and sufficient accommodating sites for the storage of Na ions. Herein, we explore the binding and diffusion mechanisms of Na on a 2D SnS sheet using density functional theory (DFT). The outcomes reveal that Na has a strong binding strength with SnS as well as charge transfer from Na to SnS, which affirms an excellent electrochemical performance. A transition from semiconducting (1.4 eV band gap) to metallic has been noted in the electronic structure after loading a minor amount of Na. In addition, a low open-circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.87 V and a high storage capacity of 357 mA h g-1 show the suitability of the SnS monolayer for SIBs. In addition, the low activation barrier for Na migration (0.13 eV) is attractive for a fast sodiation/desodiation process. Henceforth, these encouraging outcomes suggest the application of the SnS sheet as an excellent anode for next-generation SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Na3V2(PO4)2F3 is one of the most studied polyanion type cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and offers great promises. However, the inferior rate capability induced by its sluggish diffusion of electrons and ions greatly limits the practical application of electrode materials in SIBs. Herein, we develop an efficient method to fabricate in situ carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)2F3 nanosheets by using cost-effective amylopectin. The amylopectin not only could induce the nucleation of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 along its backbone to form a 2D nanostructure, but also act as a source of amorphous carbon for in situ coating on the active material surface. The composite exhibits extraordinary rate capability (104 mA h g-1 at 40 C, 51 mA h g-1 at 150 C) and desirable cycling stability. Such satisfactory achievements, especially the superior rate performance, should be ascribed to its unique 2D nanostructure which shortens the Na+ diffusion length, and the in situ carbon coating endows the composites with effective electron transport. Even applied to full cells, the obtained devices still display an exceptionally high energy density (94.8 W h kg-1), high power density (7295 W kg-1), and excellent cyclic stability.",

        "abstract": "The cost-efficient and plentiful Na and K resources motivate the research on ideal electrodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs). Here, MoSe2 nanosheets perpendicularly anchored on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) are studied as an electrode for SIBs and PIBs. Not only does the graphene network serves as a nucleation substrate for suppressing the agglomeration of MoSe2 nanosheets to eliminate the electrode fracture but also facilitates the electrochemical kinetics process and provides a buffer zone to tolerate the large strain. An expanded interplanar spacing of 7.9 Å is conducive to fast alkaline ion diffusion, and the formed chemical bondings (C-Mo and C-O-Mo) promote the structure integrity and the charge transfer kinetics. Consequently, MoSe2@5%rGO exhibits a reversible specific capacity of 458.3 mAh·g-1 at 100 mA·g-1, great cyclability with a retention of 383.6 mAh·g-1 over 50 cycles, and excellent rate capability (251.3 mAh·g-1 at 5 A·g-1) for SIBs. For PIBs, a high first specific capacity of 365.5 mAh·g-1 at 100 mA·g-1 with a low capacity fading of 51.5 mAh·g-1 upon 50 cycles and satisfactory rate property are acquired for MoSe2@10%rGO composite. Ex situ measurements validate that the discharge products are Na2Se for SIBs and K5Se3 for PIBs, and robust chemical bonds boost the structure stability for Na- and K-ion storage. The full batteries are successfully fabricated to verify the practical feasibility of MoSe2@5%rGO composite.",

        "abstract": "In this study, V5+ doped sodium titanate nanorods were successfully synthesized by a sol-gel method with different optimized vanadium concentrations. Before testing as a promising anode material for sodium ion battery (SIB) application, the samples were systematically characterized. It was clearly observed that V5+ doping significantly affects the phase formation of sodium titanate samples and leads to the alteration of the major phase of Na2Ti3O7 to a single Na2Ti6O13 phase with increasing doping concentrations. Electrochemical investigations clearly showed that the optimized 15 wt% V5+ doped sample exhibits the highest capacity of 136 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 900 cycles as well as better rate capability than the undoped sample by delivering 101 mA h g-1 capacity at a high current density of 1000 mA g-1. It is believed that the incorporation of highly charged V5+ in sodium titanate produces oxygen vacancies along with partial reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+, resulting in improved electronic conductivity. The utilization of oxygen vacancies also preserves the integrity of the electrode, giving rise to long term cycling. Thereby, V5+ doping was found to be an effective strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of the sodium titanate anode for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "In this work, the core-shelled Sb@Sb2 O3 heterostructure encapsulated in 3D N-doped carbon hollow-spheres is fabricated by spray-drying combined with heat treatment. The novel core-shelled heterostructures of Sb@Sb2 O3 possess a mass of heterointerfaces, which formed spontaneously at the core-shell contact via annealing oxidation and can promote the rapid Na+ /K+ transfer. The density functional theory calculations revealed the mechanism and significance of Na/K-storage for the core-shelled Sb@Sb2 O3 heterostructure, which validated that the coupling between the high-conductivity of Sb and the stability of Sb2 O3 can relieve the shortcomings of the individual building blocks, thereby enhancing the Na/K-storage capacity. Furthermore, the core-shell structure embedded in the 3D carbon framework with robust structure can further increase the electrode mechanical strength and thus buffer the severe volume changes upon cycling. As a result, such composite architecture exhibited a high specific capacity of ≈573 mA h g-1 for sodium-ion battery (SIB) anode and ≈474 mA h g-1 for potassium-ion battery (PIB) anode at 100 mA g-1 , and superior rate performance (302 mA h g-1 at 30 A g-1 for SIB anode, while 239 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1 for PIB anode).",

        "abstract": "Transition metal sulfides are appealing electrode materials for lithium and sodium batteries owing to their high theoretical capacity. However, they are commonly characterized by rather poor cycling stability and low rate capability. Herein, we investigate CoS2, serving as a model compound. We synthesized a porous CoS2/C micro-polyhedron composite entangled in a carbon-nanotube-based network (CoS2-C/CNT), starting from zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-67 as a single precursor. Following an efficient two-step synthesis strategy, the obtained CoS2 nanoparticles are uniformly embedded in porous carbonaceous micro-polyhedrons, interwoven with CNTs to ensure high electronic conductivity. The CoS2-C/CNT nanocomposite provides excellent bifunctional energy storage performance, delivering 1030 mAh g-1 after 120 cycles and 403 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles (at 100 mA g-1) as electrode for lithium-ion (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), respectively. In addition to these high capacities, the electrodes show outstanding rate capability and excellent long-term cycling stability with a capacity retention of 80% after 500 cycles for LIBs and 90% after 200 cycles for SIBs. In situ X-ray diffraction reveals a significant contribution of the partially graphitized carbon to the lithium and at least in part also for the sodium storage and the report of a two-step conversion reaction mechanism of CoS2, eventually forming metallic Co and Li2S/Na2S. Particularly the lithium storage capability at elevated (dis-)charge rates, however, appears to be substantially pseudocapacitive, thus benefiting from the highly porous nature of the nanocomposite.",

        "abstract": "Hypothesis: Polymer-eluted dexamethasone (DXM) will retain its ability to protect against tumor necrosis factor &agr; (TNF&agr;)-induced hair cell (HC) loss. Background: TNF&agr; has been shown to be associated with trauma-induced hearing loss. DXM has been demonstrated to protect the cochlea against trauma-induced hearing loss. DXM is currently administered either systemically or locally to treat patients with sudden hearing loss of unknown cause. Methods: P-3 organ of Corti explants challenged with an ototoxic level of TNF&agr; was the experimental system, and the base form of DXM (DXMb) incorporated into a biorelease polymer (i.e., SIBS) was the otoprotection molecule tested. The efficacy of otoprotection was determined by counts of fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin-stained HCs and changes in gene expression. Results: HC counts show 1) SIBS alone did not protect HCs from TNF&agr; ototoxicity (SIBS versus SIBS + TNF&agr;; p < 0.001), and 2) SIBS with DXMb provides a significant level of protection against TNF&agr;-induced loss of HCs (TNF&agr; + SIBS versus TNF&agr; + SIBS/DXMb, 299 &mgr;g; p < 0.001). Gene expression results show that polymer-eluted DXMb 1) upregulates antiapoptotic genes (i.e., Bcl-2, Bcl-xl) and downregulates a proapoptotic gene (i.e., Bax) in TNF&agr;-challenged explants and 2) downregulates TNFR1 in these explants. Conclusion: Polymer-eluted DXMb retains its otoprotection capabilities in our in vitro test system of TNF&agr;-challenged organ of Corti explants by altering the pattern of gene expression to favor survival of TNF&agr;-exposed HCs. These results, although in vitro, support the application of polymer containing DXMb to electrode arrays for the conservation of hearing during cochlear implantation.",

        "abstract": "Anatase TiO2 is a promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high specific capacity, low cost, and excellent cycle stability. However, low electrical conductivity and poor Na+ ion transport in TiO2 limit its practical applications. Here, substantially boosted Na+ ion transport and charge transfer kinetics are demonstrated by constructing a near-ideal non-rectifying titanium carbonitride/nitrogen-doped TiO2 (TiCx N1- x /N-TiO2 ) heterostructure. Owing to the fast plasma effects and metastable hybrid phases, the TiCx N1- x is epitaxially grown on TiO2 . Energy band engineering at the interface induces high electron densities and a strong built-in electric field, which lowers the Na+ diffusion barrier by a factor of 1.7. As a result, the TiCx N1- x /N-TiO2 electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. The reversible specific capacities at rates of 0.1 and 10 C reach 312.3 and 173.7 mAh g-1 , respectively. After 600 cycles of charge and discharge at 10 C, the capacity retention rate is 98.7%. This work discovers an effective non-equilibrium plasma-enabled process to construct heterointerfaces that can enhance Na+ ion transport and provides generic guidelines for the design of heterostructures for a broader range of energy storage, separation, and other devices that rely on controlled ionic transport.",

Nevertheless, it is still burdened with hazardous phase transformation of P2-O2 under high voltage and harmful reactions at the interface of the electrode and electrolyte. These result in unfavorable structural degradation and rapid capacity decay. Herein, a gradient Mg2+ doping approach is proposed to trigger a structural transformation. During the annealing process, the bulk-diffused Mg2+ and surface residual Mg2+ induce the formation of the P2/P3@MgO structure. Consequently, this method combines the merits of the composite phases, bulk doping, and surface modification. In consequence, Na+ diffusion kinetics and electrochemical performances are remarkably enhanced. The cells using P2/P3@MgO show 69.7% capacity retention at 0.2 C within a voltage range of 1.5-4.5 V for 100 cycles, compared with the 42.6% for P2-Na0.67Mn0.67Ni0.33O2.

Ex situ X-ray diffraction and Raman evidences reveal that an interlayer spacing change of the graphitic nanodomains occurs in HCS electrode, leading to a shift of the reversible capacity from the high-potential sloping (HPS) region to the low-potential plateau (LPP) region. This unusual capacity shift suggests a microstructure-dependent Na+ storage reaction on the HCS electrode and can be well explained by \"adsorption-intercalation\" mechanism for these HCS materials.

        "abstract": "Hard carbon (HC) displays great potential for high-performance sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its cost-effective, simple fabrication and most likely to be commercialized. However, the complicated microstructures of HC lead to difficulties in deeply understanding the structure-performance correlation. Particularly, evaluation of influence of pore structure on Na storage performances is still causing disputes and rational strategies of designing pore architecture of HC are still necessary. In this work, the skillful and controllable phase-inversion method is applied to construct porous HC with abundantly interconnected and permeable tunnel-like pores, which can promote ionic diffusion and improve electrode-electrolyte interfacial affinity. Structure-performance investigation reveals that porous HC with cross-coupled macropore architecture can boost Na storage performances comprehensively. Compared to pristine HC with negligible pores, well-regulated porous HC anodes show an obvious enhancement on initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 68.3% (only 51.5% for pristine HC), reversible capacity of 332.7 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g-1, rate performance with 67.4% capacity retention at 2 A g-1 (46.5% for pristine HC), and cycling stability with 95% capacity maintained for 90 cycles (86.4% for pristine HC). Additionally, the ICE can be optimized up to 76% by using sodium carboxymethyl cellulose as a binder.

Herein, a universal method is reported for making hierarchical hollow carbon nanospheres (HCSs) with intimately coupled ultrathin carbon nanosheets and Mo‐based nanocrystals. The in situ and confined reaction of the synthetic strategy can not only allow the aggregation of the nanocrystals to be impeded, but also endows extremely intimate coupled interaction between the conductive carbon nanosheets and the nanocrystals MoM (M = P, S, C and O). As a proof of concept, the as‐prepared MoP/C HCSs exhibit extraordinary hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalytic activity with small overpotential and robust durability in both acidic and alkaline solutions. In addition, the unique sheet‐on‐sheet MoS2/C HCSs as an anode demonstrate high capacity, great rate capabilities, and long‐term cycles for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). The capacity can be maintained at 410 mA h g−1 even after 1000 cycles even at a high current density of 4 A g−1, one of the best reported values for MoS2‐based electrode materials for SIBs.

        "abstract": "Nowadays, great attention is being directed towards the development of promising electrode materials for non-lithium rechargeable batteries such as sodium and calcium ion batteries (SIBs and CIBs), due to their large abundance, storage capacity and charge/discharge rate. Using density functional theory (DFT) based computations we have predicted that the recently synthesized bilayer s-tetrazine based covalent organic framework (bilayer TZACOF) may be a promising anode material for sodium and calcium ion batteries. The electronic band structure calculations suggest that the bilayer TZACOF is an indirect band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 0.95 eV. The sodium and calcium atoms are adsorbed on the bilayer TZACOF at the most energetically favorable adsorption sites with adsorption energies of -1.37 eV and -2.27 eV, respectively. Moreover, the diffusion energy barriers for the migration of sodium and calcium atoms on the bilayer TZACOF are 0.19 eV and 0.63 eV, respectively, which indicates the fast ion mobility and charge/discharge rate. The theoretical specific capacity (TSC) of the bilayer TZACOF as the electrode material for SIBs and CIBs is 618.69 and 412.46 mA h g-1, respectively. Furthermore, the average voltage of the bilayer TZACOF as the electrode material for SIBs and CIBs is found to be 0.96 and 1.13 V, respectively. Based on the results of rich electronic properties, low diffusion barriers, high storage capacity, and low average voltage, we can reach at the conclusion that the bilayer TZACOF may be a suitable candidate for use as an anode material for sodium and calcium ion batteries (SIBs and CIBs).",

Nanostructured carbon materials are attracting great interest as high-performance anodes for SIBs. Herein, a simple and fast technique to prepare carbon nanofibers (CNFs) is presented, and the effects of carbonization conditions on the morphology and electrochemical properties of CNF anodes in Li- and Na-ion batteries are investigated. Porous CNFs containing graphene were fabricated via centrifugal spinning, and MoS2 were decorated on graphene-included porous CNFs via hydrothermal synthesis. The effect of MoS2 on the morphology and the electrode performance was examined in detail. The results showed that the combination of centrifugal spinning, hydrothermal synthesis, and heat treatment is an efficient way to fabricate high-performance electrodes for rechargeable batteries. Furthermore, CNFs fabricated at a carbonization temperature of 800 °C delivered the highest capacity, and the addition of MoS2 improved the reversible capacity up to 860 mAh/g and 455 mAh/g for Li- and Na-ion batteries, respectively. A specific capacity of over 380 mAh/g was observed even at a high current density of 1 A/g.

        "abstract": "Facile synthesis of flexible electrodes with high reversible capacity plays a key role in meeting the ever-increasing demand for flexible batteries. Herein, we incorporated Sn-based metal-organic framework (Sn-MOF) templates into crosslinked one-dimensional carbon nanofibers (CNFs) using an electrospinning strategy and obtained a hierarchical porous film (Sn@C@CNF) after a carbothermal reduction reaction. Merits of this modification strategy and its mechanism in improving the electrochemical performance of Sn nanoparticles (NPs) were revealed. Electrospun CNFs substrate ensured a highly conductive skeleton and excellent mechanical toughness, making Sn@C@CNF a self-supported binder-free electrode. Serving as a self-sacrificing template, Sn-MOF provided Sn NPs and derived into porous structures on CNFs after pyrolysis. The hierarchical porous structure of the carbon substrate was beneficial to enhancing the Li+/Na+ storage of the active materials, and the carbon wrappings derived from polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers and the MOF skeleton could jointly accommodate the violent volume variation during cycling, enabling Sn@C@CNF to have excellent cycle stability. The Sn@C@CNF anode exhibited a stable discharge specific capacity of 610.8 mAh g−1 under 200 mA g−1 for 180 cycles in lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and 360.5 mAh g−1 under 100 mA g−1 after 100 cycles in sodium ion batteries (SIBs). As a flexible electrode, Sn@C@CNF demonstrated a stable electromechanical response to repeated ‘bending-releasing’ cycles and excellent electrochemical performance when assembled in a soft-pack half-LIB. This strategy provided promising candidates of active materials and fabrication methods for advanced flexible batteries.",

        "abstract": "Antimony sulﬁde is attracting enormous attention due to its remarkable theoretical capacity as anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, it still suffers from poor structural stability and sluggish reaction kinetics. Constructing covalent chemical linkage to anchor antimony sulﬁde on two-dimension conductive materials is an effective strategy to conquer the challenges. Herein, Ti3 C2 -Sb2 S3 composites are successfully achieved with monodispersed Sb2S3 uniformly pinned on the surface of Ti3 C2 Tx MXene through covalent bonding of Ti-O-Sb and S-Ti. Ti3 C2 Tx MXene serves as both charge storage contributor and flexible conductive buffer to sustain the structural integrity of the electrode. Systematic analysis indicates that construction of efficient interfacial chemical linkage could bridge the physical gap between Sb2S3 nanoparticles and Ti3 C2 Tx MXene, thus promoting the interfacial charge transfer efficiency. Furthermore, the interfacial covalent bonding could also effectively confine Sb2S3 nanoparticles and the corresponding reduced products on the surface of Ti3 C2 Tx MXene. Benefited from the unique structure, Ti3 C2 -Sb2 S3 anode delivers a high reversible capacity of 475 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 300 cycles, even retaining 410 mAh g-1 at 1.0 A g-1 after 500 cycles.

Here, a superior stable CoTe2/carbon anode, in which CoTe2 nanoparticles are embedded in freestanding N-doped multichannel carbon fiber (CoTe2@NMCNFs), with ultralong cycle life for SIBs, is reported. Specifically, CoTe2 nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed in the carbon matrix to inhibit its volume expansion and agglomeration during the desodiation/sodiation process, enabling a high-capacity and stable energy storage (retains 204.3 mAh g-1/612.9 mAh cm-3 at 1 A g-1 after 2000 cycles with an ultralow capacity decay of 0.016% per cycle). Moreover, a CoTe2@NMCNFs electrode exhibits a pseudocapacitive-dominated behavior, enabling the high-rate performance (152.4 mAh g-1/457.2 mAh cm-3 at 10 A g-1). The battery-capacitive dual-model reaction mechanism and outstanding reversibility of the CoTe2@NMCNFs composite are systematically investigated by ex situ XRD/SEM/TEM and a galvanostatic intermittent titration technique test, as well as surface capacitance calculations. More importantly, the fabricated sodium-ion CoTe2@NMCNFs//P2-NaNMMT-4 full cell delivers a stable reversible capacity of 445 Wh kg-1anode at 0.2 A g-1 and an excellent rate performance. The facile synthetic approach together with unique nanostructural design, provides a meaningful reference for the rational design of next-generation ultralong cycle-life SIBs anodes.",

        "abstract": "Emerging sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have aroused great attention in large-scale energy storage. However, it is still a great challenge to develop suitable electrode materials due to the large radius of Na+. This work demonstrates a strategy to synthesize hierarchical tubular MoS2 via a facial hydrothermal method with the assistance of tetramethylammonium bromide (TMAB). The results show that sufficient amounts of TMA+ ions are necessary to form the hierarchical tubular structures of MoS2. The obtained tubular MoS2 displays a high diffusion coefficient of Na+ ions, a high specific capacity of 652.5 mAh/g at the current density of 100 mA/g after 50 cycles, and a good cycling stability (94.2% of the initial capacity can be retained after 100 cycles at 1000 mA/g). In situ XRD during the discharge/charge process displays a reversible intercalation/deintercalation of Na+ into MoS2 layers followed by a conversion-type reaction. Systematic analyses reveal that the enhanced electrochemical performance is attributed to its tubular hierarchical structures with the wall composed of loosely stacked nanosheets, which can provide nearly unobstructed ion transportation paths, sufficient active sites, and enough space to mitigate the effects of the volume change during the discharge/charge process. This synthetic approach can be easily extended to other metal oxides and metal sulfides with hierarchical structures for versatile applications.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are regarded as one of the most promising candidates for next-generation energy storage devices and have been gradually grasping market share for their low cost and similar reaction mechanism and production process as compared to lithium-ion batteries. However, the low energy density of SIBs restricts their practical applications. For example, regular full cells of a Prussian blue cathode and NASICON anode have only a low discharge capacity (about 77 mA h/g at 1 C). Taking into account the compatibility of the electrolyte and electrode materials, a novel strategy for a viable aqueous dual-electrolyte sodium-ion battery (ADESIB) has been proposed using Na2SO4 solution as the anolyte and redox-active sodium hexacyanoferrate Na4Fe(CN)6 solution as the catholyte to accommodate a NASICON NaTi2(PO4)3 anode and Prussian blue Na2NiFe(CN)6 cathode. The capacity of Na+ ion deinsertion/insertion electrodes combined with the redox chemistry of the Na4Fe(CN)6 catholyte thus enhances overall charge storage and energy density. The ADESIB delivers a capacity of about 113 mA h/g at 1 C, showing a 43% improvement over batteries with a regular single Na2SO4 electrolyte. Additionally, the dual-electrolyte full-cell system is proved to reach a 84.7% capacity retention after 1000 cycles, mainly due to the synergy of the electrolytes in both sides. This pioneering research proposes an aqueous dual-electrolyte sodium-ion full cell, showing potential applications in a new sodium-ion full battery system.",

        "abstract": "Various electrode materials are considered for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and one important prerequisite for developments of SIBs is a detailed understanding about charge storage mechanisms. Herein, we present a rigorous study about Na storage properties of ultra-small Fe3S4 nanoparticles, synthesized applying a solvothermal route, which exhibit a very good electrochemical performance as anode material for SIBs. A closer look into electrochemical reaction pathways on the nanoscale, utilizing synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption techniques, reveals a complicated conversion mechanism. Initially, separation of Fe3S4 into nanocrystalline intermediates occurs accompanied by reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ cations. Discharge to 0.1 V leads to formation of strongly disordered Fe0 finely dispersed in a nanosized Na2S matrix. The resulting volume expansion leads to a worse long-term stability in the voltage range 3.0-0.1 V. Adjusting the lower cut-off potential to 0.5 V, crystallization of Na2S is prevented and a completely amorphous intermediate stage is formed. Thus, the smaller voltage window is favorable for long-term stability, yielding highly reversible capacity retention, e.g., 486 mAh g-1 after 300 cycles applying 0.5 A g-1 and superior coulombic efficiencies >99.9%. During charge to 3.0 V, Fe3S4 with smaller domains are reversibly generated in the 1st cycle, but further cycling results in loss of structural long-range order, whereas the local environment resembles that of Fe3S4 in subsequent charged states. Electrokinetic analyses reveal high capacitive contributions to the charge storage, indicating shortened diffusion lengths and thus, redox reactions occur predominantly at surfaces of nanosized conversion products.",

        "title": "Three-Dimensional Fast Na-Ion Transport in Sodium Titanate Nanoarchitectures via Engineering of Oxygen Vacancies and Bismuth Substitution.",
        "abstract": "Layered sodium titanates (NTO), one of the most promising anode materials for advanced sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), feature high theoretical capacity and no serious safety concerns. The pristine NTO electrode, however, has unfavorable Na+ transport kinetics, due to the dominant two-dimensional (2D) Na-ion transport channels within the crystal along the low energy barrier octahedron layers, which impedes the practical application of this class of potential materials. Herein, an interesting concept of opening three-dimensional (3D) fast ion transport channels within the intrinsic NTO frameworks is proposed to enhance the electrochemical performance through a combination of oxygen vacancy generation and cation substitution strategies, by which the interlayer spacing of the NTO frameworks is expanded for fast 3D Na-ion transport. It is evidenced that the oxygen-deficient and bismuth-substituted HBNTO (BixNa2-xTi3Oy, 0 < x < 2, 0 < y < 7, HBNTO) exhibits obvious enhancements on the reversible capacity (∼145% enhancement at 20 mAh g-1 compared with NTO), the rate capability (∼200% enhancement at 500 mAh g-1 compared with NTO), and the cycling stability (∼210% enhancement of retention capacity after 150 cycles at 20 mAh g-1 compared with NTO). The molecular dynamic simulations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the enhanced performance of HBNTO is contributed by the multiplied sodium diffusion pathways and the increased ion migration rates with the successful opening of 3D internal ion transport channels. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of the strategies in opening the 3D intercrystal ion transport channels for boosting the electrochemical performance of SIBs.",

        "title": "Wood-Derived Carbon with Selectively Introduced C=O Groups Towards Stable and High Capacity Anodes for Sodium Storage.",
        "abstract": "Biomass-derived carbon is a promising sustainable anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Although the electrochemical performance can be improved by introducing functional groups, the selective introduction of single functional groups into biomass carbon remains difficult. Here, we overcome this challenge by developing a wood-derived carbon with selectively introduced C=O groups by combining tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) with wood cellulose pulps. The integration of TMOS introduces abundant C=O groups into the carbon during polycondensation and pyrolysis process. The C=O groups play a dominant role in anode surface-controlled processes, and this leads to improvements in pseudo-capacity and fast electrode process kinetics. Besides, the introduction of C=O groups generates oxygen functional active sites that promote Na+ adsorption, and creates a sufficiently large graphite interlayer distance. The as-obtained carbon shows a high capacity of 330 mAh g-1 at 40 mA g-1 and excellent cycling stability. Moreover, our strategy is simple and uses wood cellulose pulps as precursors. It therefore enables low-cost and large-scale synthesis of carbon anode materials for SIBs.",

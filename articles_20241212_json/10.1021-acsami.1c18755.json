                "Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have gradually occupied the main battery market to replace lead-acid batteries due to their long life span, high output voltage, and so forth.  However, the uneven global distribution and scarcity of lithium resources have brought concerns in terms of the sustainable development of LIBs.  In this context, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have regained the focus of research by virtue of their ample resources and similar intercalation/de-intercalation mechanism comparable to LIBs.  More importantly, the lower cost and higher security of SIBs as well as the stronger environmental adaptability than LIBs make them potential new generation energy storage devices, especially in large-scale storage systems.  Unfortunately, the larger Na+ diameter determines their slow kinetics, which causes SIBs of the same material to deliver a worse rate performance or lower capacity than LIBs.  Furthermore, fast charging capacity has gradually become a necessary performance in various handheld electronic devices and even electric vehicles, which requires a high-rate/capacity anode material for SIBs. Therefore, it is still an urgent and challenging task to seek anode materials with a high rate and a high Na+ storage capacity for SIBs. ",
                "Among various anode materials for SIBs, conversion materials based on transform reactions have aroused much interest owing to their higher Na+ storage capacity.  For example, FePS3, a typical conversion material, has a high theoretical capacity of 1318 mAh g–1 due to the existence of high-capacity P.  Additionally, the finer conductivity (10–5 S m–1) of FePS3 than traditional conversion materials (sulfides, oxides, etc.) and a larger interlayer spacing (6.4 Å) than the Na+ radius (0.98 Å) make it possible for FePS3 to become a high-rate anode.  However, FePS3 tends to form bulk particles along the c-axis due to its internal layered crystal structure, greatly hindering the internal transportation of Na+.  Engineering nano-scale particles or nano-architectures (such as foamy, layered, and so forth) is considered a resultful method to generate rapid ion diffusion. FePS3 nanosheets with a lateral size of about 200 nm and a thickness of 18 nm were designed by Yan’s team.  Such nanosheets deliver the most excellent capacity of 383 mAh g–1 at 5 A g–1 for SIBs. However, the fragile nanoarchitectures will easily collapse due to repeated volume fluctuation during electrochemical conversion, resulting in poor stability.  The electrodes composed of nano-scale materials possess a decreasing volumetric energy density led by the small packing density, and the nano-scale synthesis generally involves harsh conditions, is time-consuming, and has a high cost, restricting its practical industrial application. ",
                "Another obstacle to achieving the long life span of FePS3 is the severe volume fluctuation during electrode conversion, contributing to cracking and pulverization of FePS3. The conduction of electrons is thus interrupted and the ion transportation path is lengthened by pulverized particles.  Considering these obstacles, strategies such as the exfoliated FePS3 compositing with graphene  or MXene  and coating carbon  have been adopted, but so far, there is no satisfactory long-cycle stability. To alleviate effectively the stress generated by FePS3, a composite matrix with a strong mechanical toughness is required. As a derivative of graphite, expanded graphite (EG) possesses a stronger mechanical toughness than graphene by virtue of its interlayer van der Waals force.  The active materials are embedded more easily in EG than in graphite due to the larger interlayer spacing of EG.  Nevertheless, the synthetic strategies for embedding active materials in the interlayer of EG are still rare.  Therefore, the design of an SIB anode simultaneously featuring a high rate along with a high Na+ storage capacity and a satisfactory life span is still a great challenge to be solved. ",
                "In this work, the space confinement effect and in situ conversion reaction are employed to construct evenly distributed FePS3 particles embedded in the EG interlayer (denoted as FPS/EG) using stage-1 FeCl3/EG as the precursor. The space confinement of EG not only enables FePS3 particles to achieve a smaller lateral size, which ensures rapid transportation of Na+ and electrons, but it also alleviates the volume fluctuations of FePS3 during cycling. Meanwhile, the conductive channel of EG further accelerates the transportation of electrons and Na+, contributing to the preeminent rate and cycling performance. When employed as the anode of SIBs, FPS/EG delivered 312.5 mAh g–1 even at 50 A g–1, corresponding to a short duration of 44 s per cycle. The unprecedented cycling stability of up to 1300 cycles with a retention of 82.4% is achieved at 10 A g–1. The ultrahigh rate and ultralong cycle performance were achieved for the first time in the previously reported related materials for SIBs. Also, in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed to reveal the electrochemical conversion mechanism of FPS/EG. In the assembled sodium-ion full battery (FPS/EG||NVPO@C), the excellent performance indicates the potential practical application prospects of FPS/EG."

                        "The synthesis process of FePS3 embedded in EG via intercalation and in situ conversion reaction is shown in . Prior to this, EG is first expanded to be obtained from expandable graphite at a high temperature, where a microwave tube furnace was used for heating to achieve greater expansion. Then, ferric chloride diffuses into the EG layer at 400 °C to prepare stage-1 FeCl3/EG, which was certified by the XRD pattern (Figure S1, ), corresponding to previous reports.  Finally, stage-1 FeCl3/EG was further converted into an FePS3/EG composite in situ by phosphorization and sulfidation reaction. FePS3 is well confined in the EG interlayers during in situ conversion because FeCl3/EG has a stage-1 structure (i.e., one layer of FeCl3 and one layer of EG are stacked on each other). The XRD pattern of the FPS/EG composite indicated that all diffraction peaks were in good agreement with FePS3 with a monoclinic structure (space group: C2/m), except a peak located at 26.6° that belonged to the signal of EG (a). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images indicated that FePS3 particles with smaller lateral sizes are embedded in the interlayer of EG (b,c). The space confinement of EG prevents the excessive growth and aggregate of FePS3 particles to create a convenient Na+ transportation channel. However, pure FPS generates bulk particles due to overgrowth and inability to disperse (Figure S2, ). The corresponding elemental mapping images manifested the uniform distribution of C, Fe, S, and P elements within FPS/EG (g). Similarly, transportation electron microscopy (TEM) images of FPS/EG also showed that FePS3 particles were confined in the interlayer of EG (d). The microstructure of FPS/EG was also revealed through high-resolution TEM. The evident lattice spacing of 2.92 nm can be found, corresponding to the (130) plane of FePS3 (e,f and S3, ).",
                        "A X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum revealed that the FPS/EG composite possessed four elements of Fe, P, S, and C (a). In a high-solution Fe 2p spectrum, four peaks located at 709.6/723.2 and 714.6/730.0 eV were assigned to Fe2+ and Fe3+, respectively (b).  Two obvious peaks of the P 2p spectrum at 131.1 and 132.1 eV were distinguished as a P–S bond, and another wide peak at 134.1 eV was assigned as a P–O bond, resulting from oxidized P species in the atmosphere (c).  The S 2p spectrum could be fitted into two parts at 163.8 and 162.7 eV, corresponding to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively (d). In the C 1s spectrum, three peaks at 284.8, 285.3, and 287.5 eV were distinguished as C–C/C═C, C–O, and C═O bonds, respectively, attributed to the oxygen-containing functional group on EG.  Raman spectroscopy was performed to further compare the properties of FPS/EG and pure FPS (f). The two peaks found at 222.6 and 277.2 cm–1 in line with the Eg mode represent the vibration of the inner plane in the P2S6 units.  Meanwhile, the other two distinct peaks located at 246.9 and 378 cm–1 were related to A1g modes, representing the outer-plane vibration of the P2S6 units.  What is interesting is that an obvious contrast peak between FPS/EG and FPS is located at 156 cm–1, which belongs to the Eu mode of the P2S6 units and originates from the vibration of the outer plane between adjacent P2S6 units.  The peak intensity of the very weak Eu mode of FPS/EG indicates that it has a thinner FePS3 layer than pure FPS. This result is consistent with the SEM morphology of FPS/EG observed above. In addition, two distinct peaks at 1336 and 1583 cm–1 are related to D and G bands of graphite, respectively.  The low-intensity ratio of the D band to the G band (0.2) indicates that there are less disorders and defects in EG. To confirm the carbon content in FPS/EG, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted in an air atmosphere (Figure S4, ). The weight loss below 200 °C is due to the evaporation of the surface water and the crystal water of FPS/EG. The obvious mass loss at 450 °C is attributed to the loss of SO2 after FePS3 starts to be oxidized. EG starts to be oxidized at approximately 700 °C, leading to accelerated mass loss at this time. After calculations, the contents of FePS3 and EG are 65.4 and 34.6%, respectively."

                        "The electrochemical performances of the FPS/EG composite and pure FPS are evaluated when they function as the anode of SIBs (Na sheets as the counter electrode and the reference electrode) via various electrochemical tests (). The CV curves of FPS/EG with different cycles were obtained and were between 0.01 and 2.8 V at a sweep speed of 0.2 mV s–1, as shown in a. For the initial cathodic scan, an obvious peak at 1.43 V could be due to the insertion of Na+ to form NaxFePS3. The peak of 1.1 V originates from the irreversible fracture of the P–S bond to form P and NaxFeS3.  Two peaks of 0.75 and 0.26 V indicate a multi-step sodiation of P and NaxFeS3 to generate Na3P, Fe, and Na2S. The small peak is located at 0.16 V and could result from the generation of an irreversible solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film. In the charging process, three oxidation peaks of 0.78, 1.53, and 2.07 V indicate a multistep desodiation to form NaxFeS3 and P. Particularly worth mentioning is that FePS3 cannot be reformed due to the irreversible fracture of the P–S bond.  In subsequent cycles, the reversible conversion of NaxFeS3 and P provides capacity. Moreover, b shows the galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) profiles of the FPS/EG composite. The initial discharge capacity of 787.9 mA h g–1 is obtained at 0.5 A g–1 with a Coulombic efficiency of 79.7%. The capacity loss of the initial cycle is principally due to the irreversible electrochemical conversion and the generation of an irreversible SEI film. Furthermore, the platform of the charge–discharge profiles and the peak position of the CV curve have a good consistency. c shows the long-cycle performance of FPS/EG. After 500 cycles, FPS/EG still has a reversible capacity of 456.9 mAh g–1 at 0.5 A g–1 with a retention of 77.1%. However, an evident capacity decay began to appear after 180 cycles of the pure FPS sample, resulting from the drastic volume expansion of the electrode to generate a structural collapse. With the continuous fragmentation of the pure FPS particles, more active sites are exposed and the so-called “activation process” occurs, leading to an increase in the capacity, but it soon began to decay. The FePS3 particles in the FPS/EG electrode maintain a relatively stable capacity under the protection of EG. Moreover, after 100 cycles, FPS/EG obtained 627.6 mAh g–1 without a decline at 0.2 A g–1 (Figure S5, ). The rate performances of FPS/EG and pure FPS are shown in d,e. The FPS/EG electrode delivered high capacities of 649.3, 536.5, 503.7, 476.5, 442.8, 411.4, 377.8, and 351.0 mAh g–1 at the rates of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 A g–1, respectively. What is impressive is that FPS/EG still delivers a capacity of 312.5 mAh g–1 even at an ultrahigh rate of 50 A g–1, corresponding to 44 s per cycle. Such a high rate in FPS/EG derived from confined FePS3 particles in the EG interlayer contributes to a shortening in the transport pathways of Na+ and the electrons. On the contrary, pure FPS delivers a significantly lower capacity owing to the aggregation and bulk particles, especially at high rates, compared with FPS/EG. Also, even at a high rate of 10 A g–1, FPS/EG still achieved a capacity of 322.5 mAh g–1 with a retention of 82.4% after 1300 cycles (g), exhibiting excellent long-cycle stability. The space confinement of EG maintains the stable structure of FePS3 during the electrochemical conversion process to contribute to an ultralong lifespan. However, the lower capacity of pure FPS is delivered and results in a capacity fluctuation at the end, which could be considered as a structural collapse. It is worth mentioning that ultrahigh rate and ultralong cycling performances of FPS/EG are achieved for the first time in similar materials previously reported. Besides, the electrochemical performance of EG is displayed in Figure S6,  The capacity contribution of EG is negligible due to the low content. Finally, compared with the same type of material for SIBs, this work is in an advantageous position in terms of the capacity and the rate, demonstrating the outstanding performance of FPS/EG (f). ",
                        "The Na+ storage behavior in the FPS/EG anode was further investigated to understand its internal kinetics as shown in . The CV curves of FPS/EG at different sweep speeds between 0.01 and 2.8 V are shown in a. Four peaks can be found, in which every peak exhibits similar shapes with the augmenting of the sweep rate. It is well known that the peak current (i) and scan speed (v) of the CV at different scan speeds possess the following relationship: i = avb.  Based on this, a straight line with a slope of the b value can be obtained, which is used to characterize the kinetic type of Na+ in FPS/EG. When the b value is closer to 0.5, it means that the transportation of Na+ belongs to diffusion control, whereas a b value closer to 1 indicates that it is a process that is capacitance-dominated. b reveals the relationship between the peak current and the sweep rate. The b values of peak 1 to peak 4 are 0.86, 0.99, 0.74, and 0.94, respectively, meaning that the transportation of Na+ is a capacitance-dominated process. Furthermore, the proportion of capacitance and the diffusion process are calculated via the following relationship: i = k1v + k2v1/2.  The capacitance contribution of 84.2% of the FPS/EG electrode can be obtained at 0.5 mV s–1 (c). The capacitance contributions from 51.1 to 84.2% are achieved at scanning speeds of 0.2–5 mV s–1, respectively (d). The high capacitance contributions at different scanning speeds are conducive to the excellent rate performance of FPS/EG. To further understand the reasons for the difference in performances between FPS/EG and pure FPS, their electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was tested (e). The concave semicircle of the EIS curve in the high-frequency region represents the charge-transfer resistance (Rct). Compared with pure FPS, an evident smaller Rct is found in the FPS/EG electrode, which is also the reason for its better rate performance. Moreover, according to the formula Z′ = R + σω–1/2, where Z′, R, σ, and ω represent the real part of impedance, total resistance, Warburg coefficient, and angular velocity, respectively, the Warburg coefficients (σ) can be obtained. The Warburg coefficients (σ) of FPS/EG and pure FPS were calculated and were 33.4 and 147.1, respectively. The smaller Warburg coefficient of FPS/EG indicates its faster diffusion of Na+ (Figure S7, ). These results once again confirm that FePS3 confined in EG possesses faster Na+ diffusion kinetics, contributing to the ultrahigh rate capacity. The EIS plots of different cycles are tested to further understand the excellent performance of FPS/EG shown in f. The smaller Rct after the 30th cycle compared to that of the 10th cycle may be because the process of sodiation/desodiation reduces the resistance of charge transportation. As the number of cycles increased to 100 cycles, the Rct gradually increased slightly and remained stable from 100 cycles to 150 cycles, which may be related to the formation of the SEI film and the gradual stabilization."

                        "The mechanism of electrochemical conversion was researched via in situ XRD (). At the beginning of the discharge, the obvious diffraction peaks are located at approximately 28.0 and 57.5°, corresponding to the characteristic peak of FePS3. After that, these two diffraction peaks gradually weaken, which could be derived from the intercalation of Na+ to the FePS3 crystal structure. When charging to 1.1 V, the two distinct peaks simultaneously appearing at about 24.0 and 22.6° are related to the characteristic peaks of P and NaxFeS3, respectively, which are generated from the break of the P–S bond in NaxFePS3.  The subsequent attenuated phosphorus peak is due to further sodiation to form Na3P. At 0.75 V of discharging, a small peak began to appear at about 21.0°, corresponding to Na2S, which is derived from the further conversion of NaxFeS3 to Fe and Na2S. The peak of Na2S gradually disappeared and the peak of NaxFeS3 strengthened during charging, indicating the re-formation of NaxFeS3. What needs to be mentioned is that FePS3 did not reappear at the end of charging, which results from the irreversible fracture of the P–S bond. It is inferred that unstable P–S bonds in FePS3 are destroyed due to the insertion of Na+ and cannot be reversibly restored in the electrolyte environment. In consequence, NaxFeS3 and P are used as the active material for reversible conversion to provide capacity in the subsequent cycles. It should be noted that the absence of the P peak during charging and the Fe peak in the whole process could be due to the formation of amorphous or ultra-small-sized products.  The entire reaction process equation of FePS3 is described in the . Interestingly, the characteristic peak of EG at approximately 26.6° gradually disappearing during discharging is attributed to the Na+–electrolyte co-intercalation phenomenon in the ether electrolyte.  In the subsequent charging process, EG returned to the original state and the peak reappeared, which proved the good reversibility."

                        "Taking into account that the FPS/EG anode has an excellent Na+ storage capacity in the half-cell along with a remarkable rate capacity (up to 50 A g–1) and long-cycle stability, we can foresee that it has great potential in SIBs. To confirm the possibility of its practical application, here, we match Na3V2(PO4)3@C (NVPO@C) as the cathode to assemble a full sodium ion battery (FPS/EG||NVPO@C) (a). NVPO@C was synthesized based on previous reports, and the related characterizations are exhibited in Figure S8, .  The FPS/EG||NVPO@C full battery can have an output voltage of 2.3 V under the limitation of the cathode capacity with a voltage window of 1.1–3.5 V (b). Two such batteries in series can power the LED light. The excellent rate performance of the FPS/EG||NVPO@C full battery is shown in c,d. The capacities of 439.2, 415.1, 385.0, and 331.8 mAh g–1 (based on the active mass of the anode) were delivered at the rates of 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 A g–1. Even at a high rate of 10 A g–1, it still has a specific capacity of 276.8 mAh g–1. When returning to 0.5 A g–1, it still has a capacity of 407.7 mAh g–1, indicating good reversibility. Furthermore, there is almost no capacity decline after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g–1 (e). The energy density of the as-prepared FPS/EG||NVPO@C full battery is estimated to be 113.8 Wh kg–1 at 0.5 A g–1 based on the total mass of active materials in both the anode and the cathode.

                "In summary, we successfully constructed FePS3 particles embedded in the EG interlayer by combining the space confinement and in situ conversion reaction.

EG provides mechanical support for FePS3 to alleviate the volume stress during cycling. Therefore, FPS/EG delivers a high capacity of 312.5 mAh g–1 even at 50 A g–1.

                "Due to the rapid development of portable electric devices, lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have been largely adopted in practical applications due to their light weight, high energy and superior cycling life, making them one of the main energy storage systems. Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are a novel and attractive alternative to LIBs due to the relatively low cost and abundance of sodium on Earth. Although the working mechanism of SIBs is supposed to be similar to that of LIBs, unfortunately, most of the successfully applied electrode materials for LIBs are not suitable for SIBs owing to the relatively large radius of Na+ compared with Li+, which could lead to a poor cycling performance and a low energy density. Lots of efforts have been made previously regarding the development of anode materials for high-performance SIBs, including graphite, metal oxides, metal chalcogenides and so on.",
                "Among these anode materials, transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs), such as CoS2, SnS2, MoS2, NiS and FeS2, have attracted wide attention due to their abundant reversible redox reactions through the conversion mechanism for sodium storage. They can fully utilize all the oxidation states of the transition metals, which enables a high theoretical capacity for these TMCs. However, shortcomings and defects still exist, which should be overcome before the wide practical implementation of TMCs. Firstly, TMCs tend to be pulverized during repeated Na+ insertion/extraction processes, leading to a poor rate capacity and cycling stability. Secondly, the poor electronic conductivity of TMCs could prevent the fast diffusion of Na+/electrons, which is a critical reason for the unsatisfactory rate performance. Thirdly, the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film with electrolyte degradation can result in a relatively poor coulombic efficiency. Therefore, to improve their electrochemical performance and ultimately benefit their wide practical applications, related studies on the structural optimization design and composition adjustment of TMCs are then inevitable and critical.",
                "Great efforts have been made to address the above-mentioned issues, where many preliminary studies have been undertaken on the development of novel nanostructures, such as worm-like hierarchical structures, sandwich-like structures and nanofibers. The enlarged surface areas of these structures can provide more sites for Na+ storage, alleviate the volume changes, lower the energy barrier for Na+ intercalation into the active materials, and also shorten the Na+ diffusion length. In addition, heteroatoms (e.g. nitrogen, boron and sulfur) doped in active materials have been proved to be effective in improving the electrochemical performance of TMCs. Among the TMCs, heteroatom nitrogen is the most widely used and frequently studied material, which could create much more active sites, enhance the transfer speed of Na+/electrons, and also improve surface wettability. For instance, Xiong et al. reported that SnS2-NGS shows an excellent Na+ and Li+ storage capacity and rate performance after introducing nitrogen-doped graphene sheets. Cheng et al. prepared MoS2 nanosheets by loading on N-doped carbon nanowall arrays which served as a sodium ion battery anode, where the electrode exhibited a superior long cycling life and rate capacity. Following the fundamental mechanism, it is expected that the sodium ion storage performance of TMCs could be enhanced by designing a novel material based on the above-mentioned optimization principles of 3D nanostructure and surface engineering.",
                "Herein, in this study for the first time, we proposed a new design strategy and synthesized 3D nanoflower-like N-doped C/CoS2 spheres for high-performance anode materials. N–C/CoS2 hybrid materials were prepared by a facile one-pot solvothermal method to in situ form 3D CoS2 spheres. The raw materials Co(CH3COO)2 and thiourea were chosen as the precursors, which served as the sources of Co(II) metal ions and nitrogen, respectively. This unique architecture shows many advantages: (1) the 3D CoS2 nanosheets in the spheres shorten the electronic transport distance and create a lot of valid free space for material volume expansion. (2) The carbon coated layer improves the electronic conductivity of electrode materials and more importantly, offers a barrier to restrain the intermediate reactant dissolved in the electrolyte. (3) Heteroatom nitrogen is successfully introduced in the materials, resulting in many more Na+ storage sites and enhanced high surface wettability. Using as the sodium ion battery anode, the novel 3D nanoflower-like N–C/CoS2 composites exhibit a high discharge capacity of >700 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 (80% theoretical capacity), and show an excellent rate performance of around 458 mA h g−1 at even 10 A g−1. The related results have confirmed the practical viability of using CoS2 as SIB anodes, which also provide a new way for the structural optimization design of TMCs."

                        "All the basic chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, were of analytical reagent grade and used without any further treatment. The nanoflower-like CoS2 was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. In a typical procedure, Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O and thiourea at a molar ratio of 1:1 were sequentially added into 70 mL ethylene glycol and stirred for 1.5 h. Then the solution was sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 12 h. After being cooled down to room temperature, the as-prepared samples were washed and vacuum filtered, followed by a drying process at 50 °C overnight. Finally, the samples were mixed with sulfur powders at a weight ratio of 2:1 and further calcined in an Ar environment at 600 °C for 5 h to obtain nanoflower-like CoS2. For comparison, bare CoS2 was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd."

The viscous slurry was then coated on Cu foil and dried at 80 °C overnight. Coin cells of SIBs were assembled using N–C/CoS2 as the working electrodes and metallic sodium sheets as anodes. Glass fibers were used as the separators, and 1.0 M NaCF3SO3 in diethylene glycol dimethylether (DEGDME) served as the electrolyte. The galvanostatic charge/discharge behaviors were evaluated with a Neware BTS-610 test system at a voltage window of 0.4–2.9 V at room temperature. The capacity of the electrode was obtained based on the total weight of the samples. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Instrument Company Shanghai, China) at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1.

                "The N–C/CoS2 composites were prepared by a one-pot solvothermal strategy and the detailed synthetic processes can be seen in the Experimental section. The N–C/CoS2 hybrid composites were obtained via the self-assembly process using cobalt oxalate (Co(Ac)2) and thiourea (Tu) as the precursors in ethanol medium at 180 °C for 12 h followed by a sulfuration method to improve the CoS2 crystals. As illustrated in Fig. 1, in situ growth of the N–C/CoS2 was induced by the heterogeneous nucleation of CoS2, where the nitrogen heteroatoms were introduced from the raw material thiourea. Fig. 1a shows the detailed synthesis process of N–C/CoS2 spheres, and firstly N–C/CoSx hybrid composites were obtained via the self-assembly process. The XRD patterns of N–C/CoSx after the solvothermal process are shown in Fig. S1.† In order to obtain N–C/CoS2 hybrid composites and improve the CoS2 crystals, the above N–C/CoSx was then treated with the sulfuration process. Finally, N–C/CoS2 composites were obtained. Fig. 1b shows an illustration of the Na+ ion insertion and extraction process, and when Na+ ions are inserted in the active materials, the electrochemical process can be described as: CoS2 + xNa+ + xe+ → NaxCoS2, in which CoS2 is transformed into NaxCoS2 and the thickness of nanosheets would increase. The unique 3D structure with staggered and plicated nanosheets creates much more extra space for releasing continuously changed mechanical stress from the large volume changes of active materials.",
                "The micromorphology and the internal structure of the N–C/CoS2 composites were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively, as shown in Fig. 2a–f. The SEM images of the N–C/CoS2 in Fig. 2a and b reveal that the nanoflower-like CoS2 spheres are interconnected to each other, which show a uniform size with an average diameter of 2 μm. These CoS2 spheres consist of 2D wrinkled nanosheets, as clearly seen in Fig. 2c. The average thickness of the nanosheets in the lateral direction is less than 5 nm and the unique structure of ultrathin nanosheets can benefit the electrolyte infiltration and the formation of more active sites. The TEM images in Fig. 2d and e show that these CoS2 spheres are all composed of plenty of ultrathin nanosheets with a staggered arrangement, which play an important role in generating much more active sites and enhancing the contact between the active materials and electrolyte. A representative high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Fig. 2f further confirms the CoS2 phase of the N–C/CoS2 composites with a lattice fringe distance of 0.247 nm, matching well with the (210) planes of the cubic CoS2. By contrast, the bare CoS2 (in Fig. S2†) consists of large particles with a diameter of around 4 μm and their surfaces are very smooth without showing any porous structure. The morphological differences will result in a distinct electrochemical performance when they are used as anode materials for SIBs.",
                "To investigate the surface elemental composition and the internal structure of the as-prepared N–C/CoS2 composites, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were conducted. As seen in Fig. 3a, diffraction peaks of the N–C/CoS2 composites are well indexed to the cubic phase CoS2 (JCPDS card no. 41-1471) and no other impurity peak was observed in the XRD patterns for both the N–C/CoS2 and the bare CoS2, as shown in Fig. S3†. The experimental results confirm the high purity of the as-synthesized samples. The surface elemental composition and chemical state of CoS2 spheres were studied by XPS analysis. The survey spectrum in Fig. 3b indicated that the sample is composed of four elements, including Co, S, C, and N. Through the Gaussian fitting method, the Co 2p (in Fig. 3c) and S 2p (in Fig. 3d) spectra are well fitted with two spin–orbit doublets and some shakeup satellites (marked as “Sat”), respectively. The high-resolution spectrum of Co 2p shows two strong peaks at 779.7 eV and 795.3 eV, which could be due to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Co2+ in the CoS2 phase, respectively, indicating the coexistence of Co2+ and Co3+ in this sample. From the S 2p spectrum, three components can be deconvoluted with peaks at 162.8 eV, 164.6 eV and 168.9 eV, corresponding to the S 2p2/3, S 2p1/2 splitting of the S 2p spin–orbital (–C–S–C–) and oxidized S, respectively. And the oxidized S may be caused by the oxidation tendency of CoS2 in air, which has been reported in the literature as well.",
                "The high-resolution C 1s spectrum as shown in Fig. 3e presents three peaks, where two peaks at 286.4 eV and 288.7 eV can be assigned to N–C and CO, respectively, and a relatively strong peak at 284.9 eV is due to the C–C bond. In addition, the N 1s spectrum in Fig. 3f displays three different states of N, including pyridinic N (centered at 398.0 eV), pyrrolic N (399.5 eV), and the graphitic type of N (402.2 eV). According to the results, it can be seen that the CoS2 spheres are successfully prepared by the facile one-pot solvothermal method and the N–C shell delivers a steady barrier for the CoS2 nanosheets, which benefits the electrochemical stability of these CoS2 spheres.",
                "The energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) mapping of the N–C/CoS2 in Fig. 4a demonstrates that Co, S, and C elements are homogeneously distributed over the hybrid composites. All the results presented above indicate that the nanoflower-like N-doped C/CoS2 spheres, consisting of 2D wrinkled CoS2 nanosheets, are successfully designed and synthesized by the facile method. The carbon content in the composites is calculated to be about 7.2 wt%, according to the TG result in Fig. S4.† The specific surface areas of N–C/CoS2 nanoflowers and bare CoS2 are 412.7 m2 g−1 and 128.3 m2 g−1, respectively, determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method in Fig. 4b. The pore size distribution curve of the N–C/CoS2 nanoflower composites (in Fig. 4c) shows that the average pore size is about 1.31 nm with a high total pore volume of 0.51 cm3 g−1, higher than that of bare CoS2 (0.11 cm3 g−1), based on the density functional theory (DFT) method.",
                "To evaluate their electrochemical behaviors, both the N–C/CoS2 and bare CoS2 as anode electrodes were fabricated into 2032-type coin cells. Specifically, the discharge–charge behaviors of the N–C/CoS2 and the bare CoS2 using an ether-based electrolyte (DEGDME) were determined at a current density of 1 A g−1 within the voltage range of 0.4–2.9 V. The specific capacities were calculated based on the total mass of composites, and the active material mass loading was around 1.0 mg cm−2. The representative discharge–charge voltage profiles of these two electrodes are presented in Fig. 5a and b. As can be seen in Fig. 5b, two short and weak discharging plateaus at around 1.3–1.5 V and 0.8–1.1 V can be found in the discharge/charge curves of bare CoS2, which is consistent with that of the N–C/CoS2 electrode. However, the signals gradually disappear with cycling. The main reason for the different discharge curves between the above two electrodes is the larger voltage polarization in the bare CoS2 electrode when used for Na+ ion storage, with the voltage plateaus near 1.3–1.5 V and 0.8–1.1 V gradually disappearing and eventually being covered up by a robust signal. The result confirms the good electrochemical features of the N–C/CoS2 electrode compared to that of the bare CoS2 electrode. When cycling at a current density of 1 A g−1, the N–C/CoS2 electrode delivers an initial discharge–charge capacity of 531.4/418.3 mA h g−1 with a coulombic efficiency of 78.7%. Surprisingly, as the cycling continues, the charge capacity gradually increases, which can be ascribed to the following two reasons: (1) during the first several cycles, the electrolyte gradually infiltrates into 3D porous CoS2 nanospheres, which effectively improves the contact between the electrolyte and active materials and enhances the ion transfer rate. Besides, it is reported that the increased capacity could be partly ascribed to the gradually expanded and exfoliated interlayers during the first several cycles, which can be attributed to the lowering of the energy barrier for Na-ions to intercalation/deintercalation and providing extra active Na-ion storage sites. From the 50th cycle onwards, the charge capacity stabilizes at a higher value around 700.1 mA h g−1 and the overlapping voltage profiles of the N–C/CoS2 electrode further demonstrate the good cycling stability in the repeated charging/discharging processes. For the bare CoS2 electrode, although its first charge capacity can reach up to 618.9 mA h g−1, the coulombic efficiency is only 68.3%. There is also a rapid capacity fading which results in a low charge capacity of only 299 mA h g−1 after 75 cycles. The capacity decreases by more than 50% after 75 cycles, further confirming the superior electrochemical cycle reversibility of the N–C/CoS2 electrodes.",
                "The effect of carbonate-based electrolytes, such as 1.0 M NaCF3SO3 in ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate (EC/DEC) and propylene carbonate (PC), was investigated. The charge/discharge behavior of N–C/CoS2 electrodes using these electrolytes was measured at a current density of 1 A g−1 in the voltage range of 0.4–2.9 V and the results can be seen in Fig. S5.† It can be clearly seen that the capacities fade rapidly when using the two kinds of carbonate-based electrolytes. Furthermore, a larger voltage polarization can be identified for the N–C/CoS2 electrode with carbonate-based electrolytes. The cycling performance in Fig S5c and d† also confirms the poor long-cycling life using carbonate-based electrolytes. Conversely, the N–C/CoS2 electrode using an ether-based electrolyte showed excellent charge/discharge cycling stability, which can be ascribed to three critical factors: (1) a more stable solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) layer forming on the surface of CoS2, (2) much faster charge-transfer kinetics in the ether-based electrolyte than carbonate-based electrolytes and (3) a better wettability between the ether electrolyte and electrode materials. Therefore, DEGDME was chosen as the electrolyte. Similar results have also been reported by Seeram Ramakrishna's group, Yong-Mook Kang, J. Chen and so on.",
                "To further investigate the discharge–charge behaviors of the N–C/CoS2 electrodes, cyclic voltammetry (CV) testing was performed at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1 from 0.4 to 2.9 V, as shown in Fig. 5c. The CV results indicate that the initial sweeping cycle is different from the subsequent cycles, and it exhibits a different redox behavior. Specifically, the peak located at 1.2 V and a relatively broad peak at 0.7 V in the first cathodic sweep can be assigned to the initial insertion of Na+ and the formation of Co and Na2S, respectively. The corresponding reaction can be given by: CoS2 + xNa+ + xe → NaxCoS2 and NaxCoS2 + (4 − x)Na + (4 − x)e → Co + 2Na2S. In addition, the SEI film was formed at the surface of the electrode materials during this period. In contrast, the two oxidation peaks detected at 1.8 V and 2.1 V are related to the production of CoS2. After the initial loop, the main reduction peaks shift and stabilize at around 0.7 and 1.6 V, which may be due to the improved kinetics of the N–C/CoS2 electrodes.",
                "Rate performance, as one of the critical indicators during practical applications, was investigated in sequential cycles of a series of current densities for the N–C/CoS2 electrode and the results are shown in Fig. 5d. The N–C/CoS2 electrode delivers reversible sodium insertion capacities of 777.1, 731.9, 705.3, 671.9 and 595.7 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 A g−1, respectively. An average charge capacity of 457.9 mA h g−1 can still be obtained even after the electric current increases 100 times with a current density of 10 A g−1. It demonstrates the excellent rate capacity of the N–C/CoS2 electrode. Furthermore, when the current density is shifted back to 0.1 A g−1, the electrode can still deliver a high reversible capacity of 751.1 mA h g−1. The rate testing results indicate that the N–C/CoS2 electrode can provide high-speed ion/electronic delivery channels and also sustain a high-rate cycling without changing its electrochemical behaviors and destroying the structural integrity. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were introduced to help better understand the different electrochemical behaviors between the N–C/CoS2 and the bare CoS2. As presented in Fig. S6,† Nyquist plots consist of two partly compressed semicircles in the medium-frequency region, followed by a sloping line in the low-frequency range. The plots were fitted using the Randles equivalent circuit present in the subfigure of Fig. S6.† In the equivalent circuit, Re represents the ohm internal resistance of the batteries, corresponding to the intercept on the real impedance axis in the high-frequency end. Rf and CPEf indicate the resistance and the constant phase element of the SEI film, respectively. Rct and CPEst denote the charge-transfer resistance and the constant phase element of the electrode/electrolyte interface, corresponding to the two semicircles, respectively. In addition, Zw is related to Warburg impedance, reflecting the Na+ diffusion process in the bulk electrode. The N–C/CoS2 electrode shows a relatively lower post-cycling charge-transfer resistance (Rct = 30.1 Ω) compared with that of the bare CoS2 electrode (Rct = 102.5 Ω). To clearly present the Na-ion diffusion performance, the Na+ diffusion coefficients for both samples were calculated based on the formula: D = 0.5R2T2/(A2n4F4C2σ2), in which R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, A is the surface area of the electrode, n is the number of electrons per molecule during oxidation, F is the Faraday constant, C is the concentration of sodium ions, and σ is the Warburg factor, calculated by the linear fitting results between Z′ and ω−1/2 in Fig. 5e. The Na+ diffusion coefficient for the bare CoS2 is 7.34 × 10−15 cm2 S−1, which is much smaller than that of N–C/CoS2 (2.05 × 10−14 cm2 S−1). This is attributed to the improved electrochemical reaction kinetics under the conducting effect of carbon layers, the unique 3D structure and heteroatom nitrogen doping.",
                "With the purpose of illustrating the structural advantages, the long cycling performances of N–C/CoS2 as a sodium storage anode material and the bare CoS2 electrode were studied at a current rate of 1 A g−1. As can be seen in Fig. 5f, the N–C/CoS2 electrode shows an initial discharge capacity of 531.4 mA h g−1 which then slightly rises to 704 mA h g−1 in the first 100 cycles. It was also exciting to see that the capacity eventually stabilizes at about 698 mA h g−1 even after 500 cycles. Conversely, for the bare CoS2 electrode, its initial discharge capacity is observed to be lower than that of the N–C/CoS2 electrode. A rapid capacity fading also occurred during the first 100 cycles which leads to a discharge capacity of only 259.6 mA h g−1, much less than the reversible capacity of the N–C/CoS2 electrode (700.1 mA h g−1 at the 100th cycle). The electrochemical performances described above all confirm the advantages of the nanoflower-like N-doped C/CoS2 as an anode for sodium storage. Three critical factors can be used for explanation: (1) CoS2 nanosheets are wrinkled and each is stacked atop the other, which creates much more active sites for Na+ storage and more importantly provides extra space for releasing the mechanical stress from the dramatic volume changes of active materials during repeating Na+ insertion/extraction. (2) N-Doped carbon uniformly distributed over the CoS2 spheres, thus improving the electroconductivity of CoS2 and the structural stability, which sufficiently tolerates the repeated volume variation. (3) The heteroatom nitrogen doping enhances the surface wettability, and more importantly, the N doped materials introduce more active sites for additional Na+ storage, thus finally resulting in an excellent long cycling life and outstanding rate performance. To visually show the superiority/advantage of the N–C/CoS2 for Na+ storage, comparisons of the Na-storage performance with those reported for TMC electrode materials in the literature are made as well, as shown in Fig. 6. The obtained N–C/CoS2 composite displays a comparable or even a higher rate performance than most of the other TMC anode materials, making it one of the promising anode candidates for SIBs.",
                "The possible reason for the superior long-cycling and rate performances was investigated by kinetics analysis of the nanoflower-like N–C/CoS2 composites. CV curves at different scan rates at 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0 and 2.0 mV s−1 were obtained and are shown in Fig. 7a. The relationship between i (peak current) and v1/2 (v is the scan rate) is not linear in Fig. S7,† which confirms that both non-faradaic and faradaic behaviors exist in the process of Na+ insertion/extraction. According to the earlier studies, the contribution of all stored charge could be analyzed according to the following equations",
                "In the equations above, i and v are the current and scan rate, respectively. Fig. 7b shows the plot of log(i) versus log(v) at several oxidation and reduction peaks 1 to 5 with slopes (b value) of 0.84, 0.99, 1.04, 0.72 and 1.01, respectively, which suggests that the redox processes of nanoflower-like N–C/CoS2 electrodes show partial pseudocapacitive behaviors. The total contribution proportions of the pseudocapacitor at different scan rates are quantified by the following equation,",
                "K1v is the contributing part from the capacitive behavior and k2v1/2 is the part from the diffusion-controlled behavior. Based on the above formula, the pseudocapacitive contributions at different scan rates (0.1–2.0 mV s−1) were calculated to be around 53.7%, 59.5%, 61.5%, 65.2%, 67.8% and 70.5% (in Fig. 7c), respectively. The detailed pseudocapacitive fraction plot at 0.5 mV s−1 is depicted in Fig. 7d and that at other scan rates can be seen in Fig. S8.†",
                "To comprehensively address the reversible sodiation/desodiation working mechanism of the N–C/CoS2 electrode, ex situ XRD and HRTEM testing was carried out after five discharge–charge cycles. Fig. 8a provides the XRD results of the N–C/CoS2 electrode in two discharge/charge states, namely 0.4 V and 2.9 V. The signals at 21.6°, 24.1° and 61.7° derive from the parafilm, which is used to protect the electrode materials from external air. In a discharge state of 0.4 V, the signals of Co and Na2S were detected at 44.2° and 38.9°, confirming the Na+ insertion process and the formation of Co and Na2S phases. When it is charged to 2.9 V, one weak characteristic peak of CoS2 at 39.8° can be observed in the N–C/CoS2 electrode, indicating a reversible desodiation of Co and Na2S. Accordingly, the HRTEM images of the N–C/CoS2 electrode in both voltage states are shown in Fig. 8b and c, respectively. In the fully discharged state of 0.4 V, the lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.232 nm are well consistent with the (220) crystal plane of Na2S. When it is fully charged to 2.9 V, the (101) plane with an interplanar spacing of 0.248 nm can be observed in Fig. 8c, thus shedding more light on the initial insertion of Na+ and the typical conversion reaction in a low potential window. As a result, based on the CV curves in Fig. 5c and the XRD patterns in Fig. 8a, the reaction mechanism of CoS2 can be proposed as: CoS2 + 4Na + 4e ↔ Co + 2Na2S. The SEM image of the N–C/CoS2 electrode materials after 50 cycles is given in Fig. S9.† The cycled materials retain the original morphology without obvious changes, except that the exterior surface of the N–C/CoS2 electrode becomes rough due to the formation of the SEI film and residual carbon black. This result further confirms the superior structural stability of the proposed electrode materials."

                "For the first time, nanoflower-like N–C/CoS2 hybrid composites are successfully synthesized and used as high-performance anode materials in sodium ion batteries. The improved electrochemical performance is realized by using interconnected wrinkled CoS2 nanosheets, which are found to efficiently alleviate the mechanical stresses during repeated Na+ insertion/extraction processes and shorten the Na+/electron transfer pathway. When they are used as anode materials, the N–C/CoS2 electrodes exhibit a high specific capacity of 777.1 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, a superior rate capacity (>700 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 458 mA h g−1 at even 10 A g−1), and an impressively long cycle life (698 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 even after 500 cycles). This novel and significant design of nanostructure and surface engineering provides insights into SIB electrodes and in particular transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs), and greatly benefits the development of a new concept for electrode materials."

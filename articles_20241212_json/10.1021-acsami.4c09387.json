                "Lithium-ion batteries, renowned for their high energy densities, face limitations due to the scarcity of lithium resources.  In response, sodium-based batteries, leveraging the abundant availability and cost-effectiveness of sodium, have emerged as a compelling alternative.  Sodium-metal batteries (SMBs), with a lower redox potential of −2.714 V and a higher theoretical capacity of 1165 mAh g–1, are increasingly recognized as pivotal for future energy storage technologies.  However, the broader deployment of SMBs is impeded by significant challenges, chiefly concerning the stability and durability of sodium metal anodes (SMAs). The primary challenges with SMAs include sodium dendrite formation caused by uneven Na+ distribution during the stripping–plating process, potentially leading to short circuits. Additionally, the high reactivity of sodium metal with both atmospheric oxygen and organic electrolytes typically leads to the spontaneous formation of an SEI layer.  Typically, a natural SEI layer with a high organic content provides weaker protection than inorganic-rich components, often being irregular and brittle. This condition promotes uneven Na+ deposition and the growth of dendrites, which increases mechanical failure risks and safety incidents from short-circuiting. Consequently, these factors create significant energy barriers for sodium ion transport, resulting in nonuniform ion flux and sluggish electrochemical kinetics.  In contrast to the natural SEI, which often exhibits irregularities and weaknesses, an engineered artificial SEI is designed to be uniformly smooth and mechanically sturdy. Artificial SEI integrity not only promotes an even distribution of sodium deposition, effectively preventing the formation of cracks and dendrites, but also enhances the mobility of sodium ions across the interface, ensuring a uniform deposition of Na+ and mitigating the risk of the growth of dendrites. Consequently, there is a critical need to develop a stable, uniform, and robust artificial SEI that can enhance the overall stability of the sodium anode. ",
                "To mitigate these issues, a variety of strategies have been developed to enhance SMAs through the formation of artificial interface layers using different pretreatment manners. The in situ generation of a layer enriched with PhS2Na2 exemplifies organic protective strategies employed on sodium metal surfaces.  Concurrently, inorganic protective layers have been engineered.  Furthermore, sodium–metal alloy interphases such as Na–Sn, Na–Bi, and NaTe have been explored, diminishing the relative energy of Na+ migration.  However, many single-component interface layers often fail to meet the requirements of an ideal SEI at high capacities and current densities, experiencing significant volumetric expansion and internal stress that can cause the SEI to degrade through cracking or breaking during cycling. In recent developments, based on their advanced unique structures and properties, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been extensively explored in batteries.  MOFs are porous crystalline materials constructed through the systematic assembly of organic ligands and metal nodes. The distinctive framework and pore architecture of MOFs endow them with a large specific surface area, hierarchical porosity, abundant polar functional groups, and ample reaction sites, making these materials highly suitable for diverse applications in electrochemical energy storage.  However, the exploration of MOFs for sodium anodes is still limited, with the majority of research concentrating on integrating MOF particles into solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) or modifying separators.  This approach does not fully apply MOFs to sodium anodes nor does it exploit the intrinsic properties of MOFs to their full potential. Considering the issues mentioned above with SMBs and the advantages of MOFs, applying these nanoparticles to the regulation of SMAs may offer significant benefits. Therefore, the unique microstructural features of MOFs could revolutionize sodium anode design and construct a robust SEI by providing high sodium ion conductivity and effectively inhibiting the growth of dendrites.",
                "Here, we introduce the highly stable zirconium-based MOF-808 equipped with optimal ionic channels and highly organized pore structures, which are meticulously constructed for  SMBs in a low-loss, flexible manner. ZMOF-NSC significantly enhances Na+ transport through its reliable migration pathways within the ZMOF interface, ensuring homogeneous ion distribution and meticulous control of spherical deposition, thereby reducing the risk of dendrite formation and markedly stabilizing the sodium anode. The ZMOF framework skillfully anchors FSI–, resulting in a dual-layered SEI composed of inorganics, which not only enhances uniform ion flux but also reduces Na+ transfer resistance. Furthermore, the robust dual-layered SEI formed by ZMOF-NSC acts as a protective layer that prevents direct contact between the reactive electrolyte and Na metal, thus effectively eliminating corrosion and side reactions and delivering exceptional performance. Benefiting from the exceptional advantages of the ZMOF-NSC induced dual-layered SEI, ZMOF-NSC@Na batteries show outstanding cycle stability that exceeds 2500 h. Notably, the NVP∥ZMOF-NSC@Na batteries showcase superior performance with exceptional cycling stability, maintaining a capacity retention of 81% over 2000 cycles at 10 C and continuing to perform stably through 3000 cycles even under the more strenuous conditions of 20 C. Overall, the significant potential of structured MOFs was highlighted in creating dual-layered SEI, advancing the development of durable, dendrite-free SMBs and establishing the foundation for advanced, high-efficiency sodium storage systems with excellent safety and durability."

                        "MOF-808 was synthesized following a published procedure with a tiny modification.  Typically, 30 mmol of ZrOCl2·8 H2O (9.7 g) and 10 mmol of H3BTC (2.1 g) were dissolved in the mixed solution of DMF/formic acid (450/450 mL/mL) at ambient temperature. Then the mixtures were transferred to a 1 L round-bottomed flask, stirred, and held at 130 °C in an oil bath for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, white precipitates were collected by filtration and washed with DMF and ethanol repeatedly. The resulting MOF-808 was then dried at 60 °C for 6 h. The mixture of MOF powder, Super P, and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) binder with a mass ratio of 8:2:1 in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent was milled in an agate mortar to obtain a homogeneous slurry, and then it was coated on aluminum foil with a scalpel and dried at 80 °C overnight in a vacuum oven to remove the NMP.

                "To address the challenges of the growth of Na dendrites and safety concerns, we employed a straightforward fabrication approach, creating a multifunctional artificial interphase layer by directly rolling selected MOF-808 powder onto the surface of Na metal, capitalizing on its large cavity size and high chemical stability, as depicted in a. The resultant coating is nearly transparent upon visual examination and is suitable for roll-to-roll production, which aligns well with industrial battery manufacturing processes. More importantly, our method of incorporating MOFs into sodium anodes proves to be universally applicable, opening avenues for selecting or modulating various MOFs for SMBs, as demonstrated by the feasibility validated in this study. To investigate the accuracy of the designed ZMOF-NSC structure, a series of characterizations were performed on the pure MOF and modified Na anode. The phase structure of as-prepared MOF powder was confirmed by the XRD pattern of b, and it is evident that the diffraction peaks observed at 8.39, 10.14, and 11.02° are respectively attributed to the (311), (400), and (331) crystallographic planes of MOF-808, exhibiting precise correspondence to a previous report.  FTIR confirmed that the phase structure of the MOF powder, delineated in c, reveals a pronounced and broad absorption peak at 3390 cm–1, attributable to the O–H vibrational modes. Typically, the absorption bands at 1560 and 1387 cm–1 are ascribed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the COO– groups within the benzene-tricarboxylate moiety, respectively.  The bands at 657 cm–1 are indicative of the stretching modes of Zr–O clusters, which  further elucidated the structure of ZMOF-NSC@Na. Furthermore, the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the MOF, depicted in d, manifest a quintessential type-I isotherm,  yielding a surface area of 531.704 m2 g–1 with a pore volume of 0.59 cm3 g–1. Additionally, the microporous structure of the MOF, featuring a pore size of 0.785 nm, confines FSI– anions and thereby limits their mobility, and the smaller Na+ ions experience enhanced mobility through the MOF lattice, ultimately increasing the transfer number. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to detect the ingredients and bondings in the synthesized MOF and ZMOF-NSC@Na. The analysis of the high-resolution Zr 3d spectrum in e presented two distinct peaks, located at 182.4 and 186.8 eV, that are identified as Zr–O and Zr–Zr, respectively, indicative of the Zr4+ within the MOF framework.  Concurrently, the O 1s spectrum illustrated in f reveals three oxygen states associated with O–C (531.8 eV), O═C (532.9 eV), and O–Zr (530.1 eV), which are in alignment with the individual characterization results of the MOF nanoparticles (). Furthermore, the F 1s spectrum, displaying a sole peak at 687.8 eV in , is attributed to the F–C bond from PVDF. Hence, these findings illustrate the successful fabrication and synthesis of ZMOF-NSC on Na metal, demonstrating its potential for practical SMAs with a simple, cost-effective, and scalable approach as well as its adequate mechanical strength to impede the growth of dendrites and safeguard the interface layer against penetration by sodium dendrites. In addition, the corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) showed the regular octahedral morphology of MOF grains with a uniform distribution of Zr, C, and O elements (), while scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images displayed a flat and dense surface on ZMOF-NSC@Na (a and ). Also, EDS mapping verified the uniform distribution of these elements across the surface of the electrode, and cross-sectional views showcase a dense MOF layer with a thickness of 103.5 μm on ZMOF-NSC@Na ().",
                "To further elucidate the significant role of the ZMOF-NSC layer as a robust primary SEI in promoting rapid Na+ diffusion and achieving dendrite-free SMBs, the electrochemical dynamics of the artificial ZMOF-NSC interlayers were investigated. First, the electrolyte wettability of ZMOF-NSC@Na and bare Na was quantitatively evaluated through the determination of contact angles, as illustrated in . The analysis revealed a contact angle of 47.1° for the electrolyte on the bare Na, indicating moderate wettability. In contrast, the electrolyte displayed a decreased contact angle (29.8°) when in contact with the ZMOF nanosheet coating on Na, evidencing a significantly enhanced electrolyte affinity. Besides, due to the robust adhesion of the ZMOF layer on the Na metal surface, ZMOF@Na can effectively mitigate side reactions with electrolyte despite the high reactivity of Na metal. In an experimental setup where bare Na and ZMOF@Na were exposed to the electrolyte for 3 days (), the surface of bare Na exhibited a dark-black discoloration and edge curling due to reactions with the electrolyte that produced byproducts. In contrast, ZMOF@Na maintained partial original adherence to the Na metal, demonstrating that the ZMOF layer provides effective protection for sodium metal and exhibits superior stability against the electrolyte. Exchange current density (I0) measurements from symmetric batteries constructed with both bare Na and ZMOF-NSC@Na elucidated the ion transport efficiency across the dual-layered SEI. As described in b, the I0 for the ZMOF-NSC interface was measured at 1.0619 mA cm–2, significantly surpassing those observed for the bare Na (0.6388 mA cm–2), which highlights the superior charge transfer proficiency afforded by the synthetic ZMOF-NSC protective layer. To further explain the ZMOF-NSC protective layer’s impact on ion transport mechanisms, the activation energy (Ea) was determined by fitting temperature-varying Nyquist data () to the Arrhenius model (c).  The activation energy for Na+ diffusion through the SEI of ZMOF-NSC is 74.16 kJ mol–1, compared to 78.30 kJ mol–1 for bare Na, which proves that Na+ can pass through the modified artificial layer more easily and diminishes the polarization within the battery throughout the cycling process.  Additionally, as shown in d and , the Na+ transference number (tNa+) for ZMOF-NSC is 0.93, surpassing that of the bare Na metal anode (0.80). The variation in tNa+ can be attributed to the difference in the penetration ability within the interface layer.",
                "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to explore the molecular interactions involved in constructing the Na+ migration pathway and to elucidate the mechanisms behind the designed ZMOF-NSC. As depicted in a, the ZMOF structure, characterized by its abundant adsorption sites and an orderly pore configuration, establishes a robust basis for Na+ adsorption. After the MOF structure was simplified and correlated with the experimental results, four distinct adsorption sites were identified and analyzed. Notably, the adsorption energy at vacancies between two ligand benzene rings was the highest among the sites considered, indicating site 2 as the most favorable for Na+ adsorption. Additionally, sites near Zr4+ exhibited lower adsorption energy but have a higher binding energy with FSI– (). Hence, it can be deduced that the ZMOF, with its extensive metal cluster framework, serves a dual function: it not only facilitates Na+ adsorption, thereby enhancing diffusion, but also promotes partial desolvation. DFT simulations modeling the deposition of varying numbers of Na atoms on ZMOF-NSC elucidated the reasons for uniform Na+ deposition, as shown in b. The deposition process was specifically analyzed for three Na atoms, during which the Gibbs free energy consistently remained negative, indicating the good adsorption of Na atoms at the interface. Importantly, the diffusion barrier of Na+ within the artificial SEI layer constitutes a significant factor to consider at the anode interface, as the migration of Na+ can reflect the electrochemical reactions occurring within the battery. In an effort to delineate the diffusion pathways of Na+ within ZMOF-NSC with a higher degree of specificity, we posit that four paths may broadly be classified into two categories: one mechanism involves Na+ diffusion along the metallic scaffolding, and another hypothesis suggests Na+ migration through the framework’s cavities. The hypothesis was supported by simulations of four potential pathways, as shown in c and . Significantly elevated diffusion barriers characterize paths 3 and 4, whereas paths 1 and 2 exhibited relatively lower barriers, suggesting a more facile and unhindered migration of Na+ through the latter pathways. The detailed migration paths are graphically delineated in . These observations affirm the sodium affinity of ZMOF-NSC, emphasize the rapid migration of Na+ within ZMOF-NSC, and demonstrate its efficacy in inhibiting dendrite formation, thereby revealing the material’s potential to enhance the performance of the battery.",
                "The electrochemical stability has been preliminarily justified in the long-term Na plating/stripping, demonstrating superior cycling stability exceeding 2500 h as shown in a. The voltage profile of the ZMOF-NSC@Na symmetric battery () remained consistently flat and smooth throughout  cycling, exhibiting a modest voltage polarization of 50 mV. This performance demonstrates the effectiveness of the engineered protective dual-layered SEI in ensuring rapid Na+ transport. In contrast, the bare Na symmetric battery manifested a considerably shorter lifespan of 150 h and encountered a high voltage polarization (200 mV), which suggests the degradation of Na+ under the conventional natural SEI layer, likely resulting from the growth of dendrites and leading to short-circuiting. Optical photographs () and SEM images after cycling () revealed that the bare Na surface exhibits significant degradation with irregularities and extensive dendrite formation, leading to substantial electrolyte consumption and sluggish diffusion kinetics that severely impair the performance. In contrast, ZMOF-NSC maintained a robust bond with the sodium metal and exhibited only slight surface damage, demonstrating its durability. Additionally, the ZMOF-NSC@Na batteries also exhibited prolonged cycle durations of 800  and 500 h at elevated current densities of 0.5 mA cm–2/0.5 mAh cm–2 (b) and 1 mA cm–2/1 mAh cm–2 (), respectively. Correspondingly, the highly reversible and stable Na plating/stripping process with the protection of dual-layered SEI is among the excellent SMBs when compared to those previously reported (c and ). These results substantiate the enhanced stability of the Na anode, attributable to the beneficial effects of ZMOF-NSC-induced dual-layered SEI. Additionally, d shows the rate behaviors of the ZMOF-NSC@Na and bare Na batteries at a current density ranging from 0.5 to 5 mA cm–2 with a fixed capacity of 1 mAh cm–2. Notably, the ZMOF-NSC@Na symmetric battery demonstrated significantly reduced voltage polarization across all tested current densities, with the disparity amplified alongside the current increase. Conversely, the bare Na symmetric battery exhibited a voltage instability at 5 mA cm–2. The observed findings indicate that the engineered ZMOF-NSC-derived dual-layered SEI, particularly when subjected to elevated current densities, is capable of facilitating uniform ion flux across the heterogeneous interface, thereby ensuring  the homogeneity of Na+ deposition. The superiority of ZMOF-NSC was further confirmed by the measurement of the Aurbach coulombic efficiency (CE) of Na∥Cu half batteries (e), which demonstrated a higher CE of 96.65% for ZMOF-NSC@Na compared to that of bare Na (92.51%). At a current density of 0.5 mA cm–2, the voltage hysteresis (115 mV) of ZMOF-NSC@Na, which was smaller than that of the bare Na (200 mV), as shown in , demonstrates that ZMOF facilitates the formation of SEI with the fast migration of Na+.",
                "Compared to bare Na, ZMOF-NSC@Na exhibited superior performance in terms of both interfacial and charge transfer impedance before and after cycling (a,b). The introduction of ZMOF-NSC reduces interface impedance, indicating the formation of a high Na+ transfer interfacial film, while the lower charge transfer impedance suggests a quicker desolvation process of Na+ in the carbonate electrolyte, contrasting with the higher charge transfer impedance that leads to the poor cycling performance of bare Na batteries.  Besides, finite element analysis conducted through COMSOL Multiphysics elucidated the current density distribution on the surfaces of ZMOF-NSC@Na and bare Na anodes. d reveals a nonuniform current distribution on the bare Na, emphasizing a significant “tip effect” on its crystalline surface, as indicated by red dots. The uneven deposition of Na layers likely resulted in the erratic growth of dendrites, increasing the risk of the separator being punctured and the potential for short-circuiting. In contrast, with the aid of ZMOF-NSC-derived dual-layered SEI, the uniformity of current distribution on the Na anode surface was markedly improved, as shown in c, effectively reducing risks.",
                "To further demonstrate the Na+ deposition regulated by the ZMOF-NSC-derived dual-layered SEI, the SEM images were used to highlight the regulated Na surface after cycling.  b displays that the bare Na anode without the protection of ZMOF-NSC shows a rough surface morphology consisting of numerous sharp protrusions and cracks, indicating an uneven deposition process during Na+ plating and a persistent issue of uncontrolled dendrite aggregation alongside the accumulation of byproducts, which likely leads to separator penetration and subsequent short circuits. Conversely, with the protection of ZMOF-NSC-derived dual-layered SEI, the Na anode exhibited smoother, denser surfaces and the absence of parasitic reaction products (a and ). It is evident that homogeneous Na deposition is achieved through uniform nucleation sites and consistent Na+ flux, facilitated by the designed ZMOF-NSC interfaces, which effectively inhibit dendrite formation. In the quest to elucidate the prolonged cycling stability of ZMOF-NSC@Na, the battery was disassembled for further examination after 500 cycles. Surprisingly, the anode interface unveiled the presence of spherical sodium deposition, an unexpected morphology highlighted in c,d. The formation of spherical sodium deposition under SEI is driven by diffusion-reaction dynamics. Under diffusion-controlled conditions, a low Na+ concentration beneath the SEI promotes dendrite growth. Enhancing Na+ diffusion within the SEI shifts deposition dynamics to reaction-controlled, increasing Na ion availability at nucleation sites, leading to uniform spherical deposition with smooth surfaces.  Furthermore, among all morphologies, spherical sodium exhibits a minimal surface area per unit volume, leading to a uniform formation of the SEI between fresh sodium and the electrolyte, improving CE and the cycling stability of SMBs.  When maintaining the same electrode reaction rate, the introduction of a ZMOF-NSC-derived dual-layered SEI effectively alters the kinetics of Na+ diffusion from slow to fast. This change is evidenced by the presence of spherical Na deposition after 500 h of cycling, which significantly increases the ratio of sphere/all deposition compared to the bare Na. The enhanced Na ion concentration beneath the SEI contributes to the modulation of Na+ diffusion and reaction kinetics, aiding in the suppression of the growth of dendrites and thereby enhancing the safety and longevity of SMBs. In situ optical microscopy observations further corroborate these deposition behaviors. As depicted in e, bare Na exhibited distinct protrusions that appear on the surface within 20 min of deposition. Such formations lead to markedly uneven sodium deposition and subsequently develop into mossy dendrites, culminating in short circuits and pronounced performance degradation. In contrast, ZMOF-NSC@Na consistently manifested smooth and dense structural integrity and compact morphology with homogeneous Na+ deposition during the whole electrochemical plating process (f).  These in situ observations unequivocally demonstrated that the ZMOF-NSC-derived dual-layered SEI is effective at mitigating Na dendrite formation. Overall, these findings conclusively demonstrate the significantly beneficial effect of the engineered dual-layered SEI in the uniform deposition of Na ions and achieving faster kinetics, which is expected to enhance the cycling stability of SMBs.",
                "To better elucidate the composition of the dual-layered SEI induced by ZMOF-NSC, we conducted in-depth XPS analysis. The elemental distribution after Ar+ etching, as depicted in a and b, highlights the differences in the atomic ratios of C 1s, O 1, and F 1s within the induced SEI layers. Notably, the reduced intensity of the C–O (285.6 eV) and C–C (284.8 eV) peaks, along with the absence of signatures for C═O (288.1 eV) and C═C (283.0 eV) after etching on ZMOF-NSC@Na, indicates that ZMOF-NSC induced the second SEI interface, significantly suppressing the decomposition of EC and PC during Na plating/stripping. Additionally, while a substantial O content of 53% is observed on the bare Na anode after Ar+ etching (), ZMOF-NSC@Na shows a significantly reduced oxygen content of 24% (). This reduction in the oxygen presence indicates that ZMOF-NSC@Na has a thinner SEI layer enriched with inorganics compared to the bare Na. Moreover, the presence of the organic compound ROCO2Na (289.5 eV) in the outer layer of the SEI from ZMOF-NSC@Na stands in contrast to the SEI on bare Na anodes, where organic byproducts exist in both the inner and outer layers. The O 1s spectra reinforce the significant presence of Na2CO3 (532.2 eV) and Na2O (530.8 eV) in the ZMOF-NSC-induced SEI layer, compounds noted for their high Young’s modulus and mechanical strength, which effectively suppress the growth of dendrites and enhance interface integrity.  The inorganic components showed a gradient distribution within the SEI layer, accompanied by a marked reduction in the ROCO2Na (533.8 eV) peak intensity as the etching depth increases. The F 1s spectral analysis further demonstrates a more homogeneous SEI composition on ZMOF-NSC@Na relative to bare Na, with progressive intensification of the NaF (684.2 eV) peak in deeper layers. This homogeneity is corroborated by the elevated F content in ZMOF-NSC@Na compared to bare Na, indicating a higher prevalence of NaF in the former.  It is suggest that the introduction of ZMOF-NSC leads to the formation of an SEI layer with an organic-rich exterior and an inorganic-dense interior as shown in .",
                "To confirm the enduring effectiveness of the SEI induced by ZMOF-NSC, XPS analyses were performed after 500 h of cycling under conditions of 1 mA cm–2/1 mAh cm–2. Despite extended cycling, the SEI remained robust, characterized by a rich composition of inorganic constituents (). Specifically, in the N 1s spectra (), the detection of organic N–S bonds at 399.8 eV and inorganic Na3N at 398.8 eV indicates effective decomposition of FSI– by ZMOF-NSC.  In the S 2p spectra (), the presence of RSO2F (170.0/171.1 eV), N–S (168.9 eV), and SO32– (166.8 eV), along with the subsequent emergence of Na2S (161.4 eV) and C–S (163.4 eV) after etching, demonstrates a compositional shift toward Na2SO3 and Na2S accumulation.  The F 1s spectra () show a decrease in organic S–F (688.2 eV) signals, while NaF (683.6 eV) remains constant, further emphasizing the inorganics in the deeper layers of the SEI.  This detailed analysis highlights a clear compositional stratification within the SEI: an organic-rich outer layer and an inorganic-rich inner layer. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted to elucidate the solvated sheath of Na. The radial distribution functions (RDF) and coordination numbers (N(r)), illustrated in , demonstrate an enhanced intensity of the Na–OFSI– peak at a distance of 2.3 Å due to the introduction of ZMOF-NSC in contrast to the relatively lower coordination tendency with bare Na (). This observation suggests that the majority of FSI– enters the solvated sheath of Na+, facilitating the formation of an SEI layer enriched with inorganic components.  To elucidate the suppression mechanism of Na dendrite formation by the ZMOF-NSC interfacial layer, scenarios depicting potential Na deposition and dendrite formation at various interfaces were analyzed, as shown in c. The unmodified interface leads to an uneven electric field distribution and direct contact between the anode and electrolyte, which promotes epitaxial nucleation and the growth of Na dendrites. Conversely, the robust protective layer of ZMOF-NSC (d), tightly bound to the sodium metal, provides abundant sodium-affinitive sites, facilitating Na+ transport through the MOF’s intricate 3D channels, thereby inducing spherical deposition and significantly inhibiting dendrite formation.",
                "Further assessments of the electrolyte compatibility under real operation scenarios and electrochemical performances of full batteries were conducted. Remarkably, NVP∥ZMOF-NSC@Na batteries exhibited a sustained specific capacity of 79.91 mAh g–1 after 2000 cycles at 10 C, with an exemplary average CE of 99.86% and minimized polarization, as detailed in c, which demonstrates that ZMOF-NSC exhibits excellent protection of the anode. Nevertheless, under the same conditions, the NVP∥bare Na batteries observed a rapidly increasing charge/discharge polarization (a,d), showing extremely poor cycling stability due to the severe side reactions and dendrite formation.  At an elevated current density of 20 C, as shown in b, NVP∥ZMOF-NSC@Na batteries astonishingly demonstrated a stable cycling performance over 3000 cycles, in contrast to the rapid capacity fade observed in bare Na, which can be attributed to the fast Na+ transport improved by ZMOF-NSC. Compared with recent works on full batteries, this method evidently outperforms other earlier-developed research, as demonstrated by the superior overall performance, particularly in terms of high-capacity retention and cycle life (a and ). e shows the rate performance of the NVP∥ZMOF-NSC@Na battery. As the current density increased, the NVP∥bare Na battery showed a much faster capacity drop in comparison to that of the NVP∥ZMOF-NSC@Na battery. When the current density was set back to 0.1 C, the NVP∥ZMOF-NSC@Na battery still showed a specific capacity of 111.5 mAh g–1 and retained stable cycling. In addition, similar and pronounced flat voltage plateaus were presented in the charge/discharge profiles at different current rates (), suggesting fast reaction kinetics. Furthermore, even under a more harsh capacity (), the NVP∥ZMOF-NSC@Na batteries still deliver high capacities, particularly at 50 C. However, when the capacity of the bare Na decayed to 0 mAh g–1, NVP∥ZMOF-NSC@Na batteries still maintained a high capacity of 71.08 mAh g–1. Compared with recent works on full batteries, this method significantly outperforms earlier developments, showing superior overall performance, especially in high-capacity retention and cycle life (a and ). Additionally, NVP∥ZMOF-NSC@Na batteries demonstrate a remarkable energy density of 370 Wh kg–1 and a higher power density of 10484 W kg–1 (based on the mass of NVP), outperforming previous research on sodium-ion full cells as shown in b. Despite the energy density not attaining the apex levels previously documented when solely evaluated based on the cathode mass, the incorporation of the MOFs characterized by a low atomic mass offers a considerable benefit in reducing the overall mass of batteries. This novel approach, which employs an artificial dual-layered SEI protection strategy, demonstrates considerable promise for enhancing the performance of high-energy-density metal batteries and offers significant compatibility advantages, enabling its extension to other conventional cathode materials to achieve excellent cycle performance."

                "We have developed  ZMOF-NSC, a novel and effective artificial SEI that enhances rapid ion transfer kinetics and provides outstanding durability, successfully preventing dendrite formation. The meticulously designed optimal ionic channels and highly ordered pore structures of ZMOF-NSC are crucial for promoting a uniform Na ion flux and enhancing the protective measures for the Na anode. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical studies confirm that the strategic incorporation of ZMOF-NSC provides the channels for Na+ migration and ensures Na ion flux through the interface layer, effectively facilitating the partial desolvation of Na+ and fostering the in situ formation of a robust, dual-layered SEI enriched with inorganics (NaF, Na2CO3, Na2O, etc.) possessing a high Young’s modulus and mechanical strength to effectively suppress the growth of dendrites and enhance interface integrity. Symmetric cells equipped with ZMOF-NSC demonstrate ultrastable performance, with the batteries exhibiting a remarkable lifespan exceeding 2500 h and homogeneous Na+ deposition. The superior performance of the NVP∥ZMOF-NSC@Na batteries, which retained 81% of their capacity over 2000 cycles at 10 C and continued stable operation through 3000 cycles at 20 C, underscores the practical efficacy of ZMOF-NSC in practical applications. Moreover, NVP∥ZMOF-NSC@Na batteries exhibit an impressive energy density of 370 Wh kg–1 and a high power density of 10484 W kg–1. This work underscores the pivotal role of MOFs in enhancing the structural and chemical integrity of SEI layers, crucial for mitigating issues such as uneven ion distribution and the growth of dendrites. Additionally, the meticulous engineering of self-assembled pore structures and surface active sites within MOFs not only offers a scalable pathway to establish foundational control over MOFs within SMBs but also shows considerable promise for promoting the development of long-lasting, dendrite-free electrode structures in metal-based rechargeable batteries."

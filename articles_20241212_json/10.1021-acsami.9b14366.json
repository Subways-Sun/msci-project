                "Nowadays, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with good cycling stability and high capacity have been widely utilized in electromobile devices,  while an uneven geological distribution and limited lithium compel people to look for new energy storage substitutes.  In recent years, owing to the cost-efficiency, rich resources, and analogous chemical properties to Li,  Na-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as substitutes for LIBs. However, due to the larger Na+, a majority of materials do not have sufficiently big space to host it;  thus, compared with LIBs, the development process of SIBs is quite sluggish. Therefore, finding suitable SIB electrode materials is a key factor in developing SIBs. ",
                "Thus far, a variety of materials like metal alloys,  metal oxide/sulfide/phosphide,  etc. were studied as anode materials for SIBs, while carbon-based materials with good structural stability, abundant resource, cost-efficiency, and nontoxicity are regarded as the most promising anodes for SIBs.  However, due to the smaller layer spacing of carbon and larger Na+,  the most mature carbon-based anodes for LIBs are unsuitable for SIBs.  Zhou et al. and other researchers through calculation and experimental methods testified that heteroatom doping especially larger size atom doping can enhance the electric conductivity and enlarge the layer spacing of carbon.  Until now, a lot of heteroatom-doped particularly N-doped carbon were investigated as anodes for SIBs.  However, due to the complicated preparation processes, compared to N-doped, studies about S- or P-doped carbon are rare.",
                "Moreover, recently metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted widespread attention due to their attractive characteristics, such as regular structures and high surface areas and porosities.  For the reason that MOF-derived materials can inherit the excellent properties of MOFs, numerous MOF-derived materials have been prepared and applied in many fields.  Recently, MOF-derived materials also were investigated as anodes for SIBs.  However, due to the serious structural collapse, these materials always exhibit poor cycling stability and rate performance when applied in SIBs, even if they have special initial structures or high theoretical specific capacities.  Therefore, borrowing the special properties of MOFs and designing new MOF-derived materials with stable structure and excellent sodium storage performance are challenges for MOFs.",
                "To overcome the above defects, a neuronlike three-dimensional (3D) network structure carbon with S-doping and metal particle decoration was fabricated via in situ polymerization using Th and pre-prepared ZIF-8/ZIF-67 as precursors. The neuronlike 3D structure, sulfur doping, and metal particle decoration endow the three-dimensional network structure (3DSC) electrode with excellent extra-long cycling stability at 5000 mA/g (225 mAh/g after 3000 cycles)."

Then, the ZIF-8 precipitate was collected through centrifugation, washed with pure methanol solution, and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. Second, 0.16 g of ZIF-8 was added into 20 mL of methanol solution with vigorous ultrasonication for 30 min, then magnetic stirring for 20 min.

ZIF-8/ZIF-67-derived carbon (MDC-700) and PTh-derived S-doped C (SC-700) were fabricated through the analogous procedure except for the reaction with thiophene and ZIF-8/ZIF-67, respectively. Meanwhile, ZIF-67/PTh-derived carbon (67/SC-700) and ZIF-8/PTh-derived carbon (8/SC-700) were prepared through a similar procedure."

                " illustrates the preparation process and electron transport mechanism of 3DSC-700. The ZIF-8/ZIF-67 dodecahedron was synthesized first, and then the ZIF-8/ZIF-67/PTh intermediate was prepared through an in situ polymerization reaction. During the polymerization reaction of thiophene, the thiophene monomer first self-polymerized to form long PTh nanofibers and then the long PTh nanofibers were assembled into a neuronlike 3D network structure using the ZIF-8/ZIF-67 dodecahedron as a fulcrum. Finally, a neuronlike 3D ZIF-8/ZIF-67/PTh intermediate formed after the polymerization reaction. During the subsequent calcination process, the ZIF-8/ZIF-67/PTh intermediate changed into a neuronlike 3D carbon network and the sulfur in PTh can homogeneously dope into the carbon lattice. As can be seen in , the electrons in this material, like neural induction, can transmit quickly in the entire 3D structure during the electrochemical process.",
                "a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of 3DSC-700, SC-700, and MDC-700. A broad peak at ∼23° appears in all of the three samples, which represents the (002) plane of amorphous carbon. Moreover, the calculated d-spacing values of MDC-700, SC-700, and 3DSC-700 based on the XRD results using Bragg’s equation are 0.362, 0.381, and 0.395 nm, respectively. This result confirms that sulfur doping could effectively expand the interlayer spacing of carbon materials. The most difference between the three samples is that there are other three intense diffraction peaks in the MDC-700 XRD pattern, which corresponds to Co metal (JCPDS No. 15-0806), and the Co comes from ZIF-67. There are two wide peaks centered at around 1350 and 1587 cm–1 in Raman spectra of the 3DSC-700, SC-700, and MDC-700 (b), which are assigned to carbon’s D band and G band.  The D band and G band reflect the defective structure and graphitic structure in carbon. The intensity ratio of D and G values of 3DSC-700 is ∼0.99, illustrating the higher graphitization degree in 3DSC-700, which is helpful for electronic transmission. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm in c indicates that the isotherm of 3DSC-700 is type IV, and the hysteresis loop suggests the mesoporous architecture of 3DSC-700. Due to its special architecture, 3DSC-700 presents a higher specific surface area of 419 m2/g. 3DSC-700 presents microporous and mesoporous architectures, which can be seen in the pore-size distribution profile (inset in c). XPS was conducted to identify the elemental composition of 3DSC-700. The XPS spectrum of 3DSC-700 shows that the sample contains C, S, N, Co, and Zn elements (). N, Co, and Zn come from the ZIF-8/ZIF-67 precursor. There are four fitted peaks located at 286.4, 284.9, 284.5, and 284.1 eV in the C 1s spectrum (), which are ascribed to C–N groups, C–S, C–C, and C═C respectively.  The two fitted peaks at 165.0 and 163.8 eV in the S 2p spectrum (d) corresponds to S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 for the thiophene-type −C–S–C– bond.  The S content in the 3DSC-700 is as high as 20.1 wt % () according to the elemental analysis results. The absorption peak at 1119 cm–1 in the 3DSC-700 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum corresponds to the band of C–S–C ().  The XPS and FTIR () results confirm that the S exits in the form of covalent bonds in the carbon lattice, that’s why the S has not been seen in the XRD pattern.",
                "Morphologies and sizes of MDC-700, SC-700, and 3DSC-700 were studied by SEM and TEM. The MDC-700 shows a regular morphology of rhombic dodecahedra with the diameter ranging from 400 to 600 nm, and the little particles on the MDC-700 surface are metal particles (a and ). The SC-700 from PTh exhibits a nanofiber morphology, and the nanofibers piled up together (b). c,d clearly reveal that the morphology of 3DSC-700 is a neuronlike 3D network structure. There are many polyhedrons scattered in the 3D network in the low-resolution SEM image (c), which are MOF-derived dodecahedrons and can be distinctly seen in the high-resolution SEM graphics (d). Due to the PTh coating, the morphology of the dodecahedron becomes irregular. TEM observations also certify the 3D network structure, and the curved line in a is the PTh-derived carbon. A regular fringe of the MOF-derived dodecahedrons can be apparently detected from the HRTEM image (b). An obvious interplanar spacing of 2.05 Å corresponds to the Co(111) crystal plane (b). c–h present the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and elemental mappings of the 3DSC-700. EDS elemental mappings exhibit the uniform distribution of carbon (d), sulfur (e), nitrogen (f), cobalt (g), and zinc (h), which shows the same results as XPS.",
                "Sodium storage performances of the 3DSC-700, MDC-700, and SC-700 electrodes were evaluated in half coin cells. a,  display the CV curves of the 3DSC-700, MDC-700, and SC-700. All of them present a broad peak located at 1.0–1.3 V during the first scan, which can be attributed to the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formation and irreversible reactions on the electrode surface. The reduction peak close to 0 V is attributed to the insertion of Na+ into the layer of carbon.  For the MDC-700 electrode, the reduction peaks located at 1.2, 0.6, 0.28, and 0 V in the initial scan can be ascribed to the irreversible reactions on the MDC-700 surface, the SEI formation, and the insertion of Na+ in the MDC-700 interlayer, respectively ().  The oxidation peak at 0.85 V in the MDC-700 electrode is mostly related to the reversible reaction between N functional groups and Na+.  Compared with MDC-700, both 3DSC-700 and SC-700 electrodes exhibit other two pairs of redox peaks centered at 1.15/1.80 and 1.75/2.15 V, which are similar to room-temperature Na–S batteries, and these two pairs of redox peaks are attributed to the Faradaic reactions between covalent sulfur and Na+.  The two pairs of peaks still exist after three cycles, suggesting the electrochemical activity of the covalent sulfur and the highly reversible reaction between S and Na. Additionally, the CV profiles of the subsequent cycles are nearly overlapping (a), illustrating the superior cycling stability of the 3DSC-700 electrode.",
                "There are two apparent sloping platforms at ∼1.25 and ∼1.75 V during the charge/discharge processes of the 3DSC-700 electrode except for the initial cycle (b), which is ascribed to Na+ insertion into the 3DSC-700 structure to react with covalent sulfur and consistent with the CV curves. The 3DSC-700 (b), MDC-700 (), and SC-700 () present initial charge/discharge capacities of 526.1/1087.7, 58.7/227.1, and 282.1/686.3 mAh/g, respectively. Cycling stabilities of the prepared 3DSC-700, MDC-700, and SC-700 were tested at different current densities. When tested at 100 mA/g, after 100 cycles, the 3DSC-700 can retain a reversible capacity of ∼ 450 mAh/g, but the capacities of MDC-700 and SC-700 after 100 cycles are 36.4 and 216.9 mAh/g, respectively (). Even at 5000 mA/g, the 3DSC-700 electrode still possesses outstanding extra-long cycling stability (c) and presents a highly reversible capacity of 225 mAh/g after 3000 cycles. Rate performances of the 3DSC-700, MDC-700, and SC-700 electrodes are tested at 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 5000 mA/g. Reversible capacities of 343.6, 307.2, 287.4, 275.1, and 264.6 mAh/g are reached respectively for the 3DSC-700 electrode at each current density (d). Notably, when the current density decreases to 1000 mA/g, the capacity can be restored to 354.9 mAh/g, illustrating that the 3DSC-700 electrode has a high ability to endure high current changes. Additionally, compared to 8/SC-700 and 67/SC-700, the 3DSC-700 electrode also exhibits higher capacities ().  lists the comparison of electrochemical performance between the 3DSC-700 electrode and those reported in the literature, where the 3DSC-700 presents the highest capacity among the reported carbon-based material for SIBs whether tested at low or high current density. To explore the impressive high-rate performance of the 3DSC-700 electrode, EIS was adopted to study the electrical conductivities of the electrodes. e displays Nyquist plots of the 3DSC-700, MDC-700, and SC-700 electrodes. As shown, all of the three plots consist of a semicircle and an inclined straight line.  The semicircle relates to the double-layer capacitance, the charge transfer resistance (Rct), and the electrolyte and electrode resistance.  The straight line arises from the Warburg impedance (Zw) and corresponds to the Na+ diffusion in electrodes.  The Rct values of the 3DSC-700, MDC-700, and SC-700 electrodes are 215, 965, and 628 Ω, respectively. The lower Rct value of the 3DSC-700 electrode is attributed to the co-effects of sulfur doping, the special structure, and metal particle decoration.",
                "Pseudocapacitive contributions, Na adsorption energies, theoretical capacities, and Na diffusion energy barriers were further adopted to investigate the excellent high-rate performance of the 3DSC-700 electrode. CV profiles at different scan rates are tested, and the results are displayed in a. All relevant calculation equations are presented in the . The calculated b values of peak1 and peak2 are 0.84 and 0.96, respectively. These results manifest that the performance of sodium storage in the 3DSC-700 electrode is related to both diffusion-controlled reaction and surface capacitive-controlled behavior. The 3DSC-700 electrode delivers a capacitive contribution of 88% at 0.6 mV/s (b). Moreover, the pseudocapacitive contributions are 81, 85, 88, 89, and 90% at 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 mV/s for the 3DSC-700 electrode, respectively (c). These results exhibit that the capacitive contribution is augmented gradually with the increasing sweep rate. The capacitive contribution in the 3DSC-700 electrode is higher than 80%, illustrating fast reaction kinetics characteristics in it. That may explain why the 3DSC-700 electrode has outstanding capacities at high current densities.",
                "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to provide an in-depth understanding of S-doping effects on the performance of SIBs, including Na adsorption energies, theoretical capacities, and Na diffusion energy barriers, which determine the charge/discharge rate of SIBs. Detailed DFT calculation methods are shown in the . A fundamental precondition of SIB anode materials is that the material must have a relatively strong Na adsorption ability. For pristine carbon, sodium atoms prefer to be adsorbed on the hollow site with an adsorption energy of −1.23 eV (d). After incorporating S atoms, the most stable sites are the top of S atoms with an enhanced adsorption energy of −1.62 eV in comparison with pristine carbon (e). This is attributed to the fact that the higher electron density surrounding the S atoms is in favor of the adsorption of positively charged Na atoms, endowing the S-doped carbon with improved Na adsorption ability. Then, we examined the maximum Na adsorption capacity by increasing the number of sodium atoms. The adsorption energies gradually decrease upon increasing the number of sodium atoms (f), which can be attributed to the increased repulsive electrostatic interactions between Na atoms. As a consequence, pristine and S-doped carbon can accommodate at most four and six Na atoms, corresponding to the chemical formulae Na4C16 and Na6S2C14, respectively. The mobility of Na atoms is another important factor for anode materials, which is closely relevant to the charge and discharge rates in SIBs. Therefore, with the aid of the NEB method, diffusion pathways between two nearest-neighboring adsorption sites for Na are examined (g). It is found that Na diffusion on S-doped carbon is faster than that on pristine carbon due to the lower diffusion energy barrier (0.29 and 0.20 eV for pristine and S-doped carbon, respectively), indicative of a faster charge/discharge rate in S-doped carbon. In combination with these superior characteristics, including enhanced Na adsorption energy, higher Na storage capacity, lower Na diffusion barrier, and higher electronic conductivity, it can be concluded that the S-doping, the special neuronlike 3D network structure, and metal particle decoration play vital roles in improving carbon-based anodes for Na-ion batteries.",
                "The intriguing cycling stability and excellent rate performance of the 3DSC-700 encouraged us to explore its actual performance in sodium-ion full cells. In a Na-ion full cell, the 3DSC-700 anode is coupled with a homemade NVP cathode. The typical CV curves of the Na-ion full cell in a show that there are two apparent cathodic peaks at around 2.5 and 3.65 V during the first cathode scanning process and one wide oxidation peak around 3.1 V during the first anode scanning process. b shows the discharge/charge curves of an NVP//3DSC-700 cell at 100 mA/g. There are two apparent sloping platforms at ∼3.4 and ∼3.65 V in the charge/discharge processes, which are relevant to the deinsertion and insertion of Na+ and consistent with the CV curves. The full cell exhibits charge/discharge capacities of 342.14/273.32 mAh/g in the first cycle (based on anode mass). Moreover, the full cell delivers good cycling performance and a high capacity of 229.64 mAh/g could still be obtained after 50 cycles (c). The inset images in c show that the blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can be driven by one assembled cell. These results demonstrate that the 3DSC-700 has a promising application as an anode in commercial SIBs."

                "In conclusion, ZIF-8/ZIF-67-derived dodecahedrons and Th are employed as fulcrums and the sulfur source to synthesize a unique neuronlike 3D network structure S-doped carbon. Due to the co-effects of the special neuronlike 3D structure, sulfur doping, and metal particle decoration, the 3DSC-700 electrode delivers outstanding capacity and extra-long-term cycling stability when it was used as an anode in SIBs. Moreover, theoretical calculations certify that the S-doping can endow the carbon-based material with enhanced Na adsorption energies, more Na atom accommodation, and a lower diffusion energy barrier. This work also indicates the promising potential of MOFs and polymer used in energy storage fields.

                "For several decades, the social demand for portable devices has led to the development of many state‐of‐the‐art technologies and academic achievements in lithium‐ion battery (LIB) research. Consequently, LIBs have been utilized in various mobile devices, conveniently fulfilling various roles in our daily lives. In addition, considering the growing serious environmental issues caused by fossil‐fuel combustion, electrical energy has been widely accepted as a clean and sustainable energy resource. However, LIB systems are not cost‐effective for large‐scale electrical‐energy storage due to the high cost of Li; thus, there is an urgent demand for alternative systems capable of large‐scale energy storage. In this regard, intensive research efforts have been devoted to sodium‐ion battery (SIB) systems, as Na is one of the most abundant elements in the Earth's crust.",
                "Other issues associated with rechargeable ion batteries, even in large‐scale storage systems, are weight and flexibility. Low‐density carbon‐derivatives, including graphene oxides, reduced graphene oxides, and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), as well as their combinations with porous organic materials, such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs), have been proposed as light and flexible materials for use in energy‐storage systems. COFs have gained attention as an emerging class of battery electrode materials because their frameworks can form conjugated networks in two‐dimensional (2D) directions with ordered mesoporous arrays, and electrons can be delocalized through the frameworks. Furthermore, in the conventional COFs, the 2D frameworks can be stacked to form 3D structures in an eclipse arrangement via supramolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding and π‐π interactions. Additionally, the 3D structures have mesoporous 2D channels, which can facilitate ion mobility. However, the introduction of linkers into the frameworks, which is necessary for the 3D structure, can break the π conjugation, giving rise to poor electrical conductivity. Moreover, COFs exhibit low colloidal stability in solutions due to their strong tendency to form 3D supramolecular structures.",
                "Previously, we dedicated our research efforts to developing a new type of network polymer called covalent organic nanosheets (CONs), as a potential anode material for SIBs. The material was designed to overcome the drawbacks of COFs regarding conductivity. CONs are similar to exfoliated nanosheets of 3D COFs, except that they do not contain linkers that can form hydrogen bonds. The absence of linkers enables CONs to not only be fully conjugated but to also prevent 3D stacking, resulting in better electrical conductivity and higher colloidal stability than those of COFs. Since CONs do not conventionally form 3D stacks of sheets, they hardly form ordered mesoporous 2D channel arrays in solid states. However, we demonstrated that CONs with relatively high conductivity can perform better as anodes of SIBs than similarly structured CONs with relatively high porosity and/or surface area. Further, as shown in our previous paper, it was found that CONs can improve the SIB performance by controlling their band gap to improve the electrical conductivity. Thus, we propose that the material conductivity is also one of the important factors influencing the performance of SIBs, although the surface‐area control is also essential.",
                "In this contribution, to provide insights and breakthroughs for the material design for SIBs, we suggested an alternative simple method to enhance the electrical conductivity of electrode materials via the hybridization of organic/inorganic 2D materials. We selected graphene nanosheets (GNs) as a starting material for the hybridization with CONs since GNs, which has a very high electrical conductivity, can enhance the electrochemical Na‐ion storage property. As suggested in Scheme a, CON polymerization was conducted in the presence of GNs via a layer‐by‐layer method. To form a type of network polymer, two monomers, 2,4,6‐tris(5‐bromothiophen‐2‐yl)‐1,3,5‐triazine (M1) and 2,5‐bis(trimethylstannyl)thieno‐(3,2‐b)thiophene (M2), were polymerized via the Stille cross‐coupling reaction over Pd0 catalysts. To optimize the hybridization method, CON formation in the presence of GNs was performed via two different routes: reflux and solvothermal methods, as demonstrated in previous works. Further, we examined the electrochemical Na‐ion storage property of the hybrids: CON‐G‐10 and CON‐G‐16, synthesized by the reflux and solvothermal methods, respectively. The structural and compositional factors were systematically investigated by comparing the hybrids with the bare CONs. Both CON‐10 and 16 were prepared following previously reported procedures, as shown in Scheme b."

                "The 13C cross‐polarization (CP) magic‐angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) profiles for all the CONs and CON‐G hybrids were analyzed, as displayed in Figure a and b; the GNs spectrum was also analyzed as a reference in the hybrid structures. As expected, the characteristic peaks of all the CONs, hybrids, and GNs were observed in the aromatic carbon region; no specific peaks were observed in the aliphatic carbon region, except spinning side bands, which correspond to the peaks in the aromatic region. Furthermore, the NMR spectrum of the GNs well demonstrates a broad sp2 carbon peak at around 120 ppm with negligible signals derived from oxidized carbon, corresponding to pure graphite. The results implied that no significant chemical deterioration of the aromatic backbones occurs during the synthesis process. As proven in previous studies, the carbon peak of the C=N bonds in s‐triazine moieties appeared at around 170 ppm for all the CONs and hybrids (denoted by the dark‐orange perpendicular line in Figure a and “a” in Figure b). In addition, the peaks derived from the carbons adjacent to s‐triazine (denoted by the dark‐orange perpendicular line in Figure a and “b”, “c”, “d”, and “e” in Figure b) and the peak derived from the carbons in thienothiophene (denoted by the dark‐orange perpendicular line in Figure a and “f” in Figure 1b) were detected at around 145–125 ppm and 115 ppm, respectively, for all the CONs and hybrids. However, all the peaks of the hybrids (CON‐G‐10 and CON‐G‐16) were broader than those of the bare CONs. The broadening of the “f” peak at around 115 ppm for the hybrids was even more severe, tailing up to approximately 100 ppm. The characteristic peaks derived from the two components in the hybrids can overlap, due to broadening and tailing; thus, it can be suggested that the two components (CONs and GNs) were hybridized in their solid states. In addition, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out to elucidate thermal behavior of CONs and hybrids. According to the TGA results, both CON‐G‐10 and CON‐G‐16 showed higher degradation temperature in comparison with those of the bare CONs, implying that the addition of GNs into the matrices of CONs could reinforce thermal stability (Figure S1, see Supporting Information). Tyndall tests of CONs and hybrids in very dilute concentration of 0.01 g L−1 showed that clear laser‐light pathway can be observed under sunlight and dark condition, clarifying an excellent colloidal stability of samples.",
                "The Fourier‐transform infrared (FTIR) profiles of all the CONs, hybrids, and GNs were evaluated and compared to confirm the presence of functional groups, as shown in Figure c (the specific vibrational frequencies are also denoted in Figure b by matching colors with the dotted‐line colors in Figure c). First of all, the FTIR spectrum of the GNs clearly shows an aromatic C=C vibration mode at approximately 1550 cm−1 (gray dotted line in Figure c), without a significant presence of oxygen‐containing functional groups. Conversely, the C=N vibrational mode in s‐triazine was detected at approximately 1498 cm−1 for all the CONs and their hybrids. In general, the C=N vibrational frequency of s‐triazine in graphitic carbon nitride materials appears at around 1600 cm−1. Based on the literature, the C=N group of s‐triazine conjugated with thiophene is typically red‐shifted relative to graphitic carbon nitrides. The red‐shifted C=N bond suggested the existence of secondary bonds between nitrogen and sulfur, characterized as N−S intermolecular interactions in polythiazyl (Figure b). Such interactions are favorable for the formation of a planar conformation that locks the triazine rings and adjacent thiophene rings, thereby influencing the planarity of the entire framework, as predicted by density functional theory (DFT) calculation (Figure S2, see Supporting Information). Due to this red‐shift of the C=N vibration in this specific case, all the CONs and their hybrids clearly showed s‐triazine motifs without the peak overlapping with the C=C vibration peak for GNs. Furthermore, the FTIR spectra of all the CONs and their hybrids represented the Cβ−H out‐of‐plane vibrational mode at around 802–788 cm−1. In particular, the C=C bonds of the pristine GNs were still discernible in FTIR spectra of the hybrids, showing that the double bonds of both GNs and CONs were preserved in the hybrids. In addition, the X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) profiles were investigated in 1 s orbitals of C and N together with 2p orbital of S to confirm all the characteristic chemical bonds as shown in Figure S3 (see Supporting Information). Therefore, notably, CONs were successfully synthesized in the presence of GNs and hybridized without any decomposition of the chemical structure of each framework.",
                "The electronic structures of CONs upon hybridization with GNs were investigated by analyzing their solid‐state ultraviolet/visible (UV/Vis) absorption, as shown in Figure a with adsorption coefficients converted by Kubelka‐Munk equation. The absorption onsets of the bare CONs and the hybrids were almost identical, implying that the hybridization of CONs with GNS under reflux and solvothermal conditions did not alter the polymerization mechanism of the CONs. Furthermore, the bandgaps of all materials determined through Tauc plots with the absorption coefficients obtained from the Kulbelka‐Monk method were 2.03 eV for two types of CONs and 2.00"

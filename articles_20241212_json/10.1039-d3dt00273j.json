                "In recent years, with the rapid development of sodium ion battery research, more and more excellent sodium ion electrodes have emerged, such as polyanionic anodes, anatase TiO2,etc. The exploration of wearable electronics and microelectronic devices has promoted the research of high performance, multi-functional, customizable and flexible micro-power sources. A flexible sodium ion micro battery is considered as a promising new micro power source due to its rich sodium resources and relatively low price. However, because of the larger radius and lower standard electrochemical potential of sodium ions compared with those of lithium ions, the speed of sodium ions embedding into the electrode material is slow, which hinders the development of the anode electrode of sodium ion batteries (SIBs). In recent years, based on the existing lithium-ion battery technology, there have been a lot of studies trying to apply alloys and transition metal compounds to SIBs, but this kind of anode material tends to expand in volume during the process of sodiation/desodiation, resulting in poor cycling stability. Therefore, a new anode material with a higher rate capacity and more stable structure needs to be prepared through reasonable design and precise control.",
                "A material with high-rate performance must be a material with fast ion diffusion dynamics. As typical representatives of transition metal selenides, cobalt selenide and nickel selenide exhibit high reversible capacity, distinctive ionic transfer kinetics and multiple redox reactions. Importantly, their larger lattice parameters and higher electrical conductivity than oxides make them more advantageous for enhancing ion diffusion dynamics. Liu et al. reported a nanorod-like cobalt selenide electrode material that could provide a reversible capacity of up to 435 mA h g−1, and remain at 282 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 2 A g−1. The Mai team reported an octahedral nickel selenide with a capacity of 313 mA h g−1 after 4000 cycles at 5 A g−1. Even at 20 A g−1, the capacity can reach up to 175 mA h g−1. However, their performance at high rates is not satisfactory. Therefore, it is necessary to design the structure of nickel selenide and cobalt selenide reasonably in order to give full play to their structural advantages.",
                "Combining metal nanocrystals with different band gap values to construct heterojunction complexes is an effective means to solve a series of problems in the process of sodium ion storage. Due to the synergistic effect of the coexistence of multiple components, heterojunction materials can provide enhanced electrical conductivity of the overall material, provide higher electrochemical activity, accelerate ion diffusion dynamics, and reduce the reaction barrier. At the same time, due to the chemical bonding force and electrostatic force between the heterojunction components, the material exhibits low volume expansion and a relatively stable structure. As cobalt and nickel belong to the VIII A group, their structure and size are very close to each other, and they are easy to be doped with each other. Therefore, cobalt selenide and nickel selenide can form a unique heterojunction structure, thus improving the sodium storage performance.",
                "In addition, the synthesis of flexible anode materials is also a key step in the application of flexible batteries. Mai et al. prepared flexible acidized carbon cloth electrodes and achieved a desirable improvement of K-ion storage performance. In previous reports, most of the methods used to synthesize flexible materials are electrospinning, chemical vapor deposition, coating, etc., but it is difficult for these methods to meet the technological requirements of large-scale preparation due to their complicated steps, expensive equipment and poor flexibility. As a new nano functional material, graphene has the advantages of remarkable conductivity, good film formation and high specific surface area. By combining metal selenides with graphene, a simple vacuum filtration method can produce a composite membrane with excellent flexibility. This method is not only simple and easy, but also avoids the use of a conductive agent, binder and current collector, greatly saves the cost and improves the mass energy density. The introduction of graphene could also further enhance the overall electrical conductivity, maintain the uniform dispersion and reduce the size of metal particles. The chemical bonding combination of the oxygen bridge between graphene and metal can anchor metal particles tightly to the surface of graphene, speeding up electron transport and enhancing ion diffusion.",
                "In this work, a strategy for the preparation of flexible electrodes was reported. A unique nanorod NiCoSex film heterojunction wrapped around carbon nanotubes (NiCoSex/CG) anchored on the surface of graphene was prepared by hydrothermal selenization and vacuum filtration, and its energy storage performance was investigated as a flexible binder-free anode for SIBs. The synergistic effect of the heterojunction makes it exhibit remarkable rate capability and long cycling stability. NiCoSex/CG provides a reversible capacity of 338 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, and maintains a reversible capacity of 120 mA h g−1 after 2000 cycles at 2 A g−1. Furthermore, the assembled flexible full battery exhibits excellent flexibility and output stability. After folding and crimping, the flexible full battery still maintains a stable output. This method has a high reference value for the synthesis of other similar flexible materials."

                "As shown in Scheme 1, a unique nanorod NiCoSex film heterojunction wrapped around carbon nanotubes (NiCoSex/CG) anchored onto the graphene was prepared by hydrothermal selenization and vacuum filtration. For comparison, NiSe2/CG films and CoSe2/CG films were separately synthesized by the same method as NiCoSex/CG films. As observed in Fig. 1a, the NiCoSex/CG film is a smooth black membrane, and the diameter of the membrane is ca. 4 cm. In particular, the film was bent without breaking and remained intact, showing excellent flexibility (Fig. 1b). Fig. 1c shows the XRD spectra of three films; it can be distinguished that the diffraction peaks of CoSe2/CG are similar to the characteristic peaks of standard cobalt selenide (JCPDS: 09-0234), while the diffraction peaks of NiSe2/CG are similar to the characteristic peaks of standard nickel selenide (JCPDS: 41-1485). The diffraction peaks of the NiCoSex/CG film are the coincident characteristic peaks of the two standard selenides, indicating that the heterostructure of cobalt–nickel–selenide has been successfully synthesized. The percentage content of each component in the three films can be calculated according to the TG curves, as observed in Fig. 1d. The weight losses of NiSe2/CG, CoSe2/CG and NiCoSex/CG are 77.8%, 91.0% and 84.1% respectively. Therefore, it can be inferred that CoSe2 accounts for 60.0 wt% in CoSe2/CG, and the carbon material accounts for 40.0 wt%. NiSe2 accounts for 23.5 wt% in NiSe2/CG and the carbon material accounts for 76.5 wt%. In NiCoSex/CG, CoSe2 and NiSe2 account for 21.1 wt% and 21.1 wt% respectively, and the carbon material accounts for 57.8 wt% (the detailed calculation process is listed in the attachment).",
                "Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) test results indicate that the surface area of NiCoSex/CG (Fig. 1e) is 94.9 m2 g−1, which is larger than those of CoSe2/CG (68.6 m2 g−1), NiSe2/CG (74.1 m2 g−1) and rGO (17.6 m2 g−1). The pore size of the NiCoSex/CG film (Fig. 1f) is mainly in the form of micropores (2–20 nm), and enough mesopores can effectively increase the electrochemical active areas of the electrodes and accommodate more sodium ions. Fig. 1g–l show the SEM images of the films at high and low magnifications, which directly reflect the microstructure of the films. In the low-magnification SEM (Fig. 1g–i), the three films are uniformly loaded with rod-like metal selenides on the graphene surface. Further magnification (Fig. 1j–l) shows that the rod-like selenide is wrapped by carbon nanotubes, and the rod is hollow. The outer carbon layer wrapped the inner selenide particles. In contrast, the rods of CoSe2/CG are longer, while the rods NoSe2/CG are shorter, and the rods of NiCoSex/CG are thicker. By observing these three films’ cross sections (Fig. S1 and S2†), the thickness of NiCoSex/CG (15.2 μm) is larger than those of CoSe2/CG (12.0 μm) and NiSe2/CG (14.6 μm), which indicates that the heterojunction formed by the simultaneous introduction of cobalt and nickel can effectively increase the structural voids and specific surface areas, which is consistent with the conclusion of the BET tests. Since graphene layers are too tightly stacked to accommodate Na ions, other active materials need to be inserted into graphene interlayers to increase the layer spacing, promote ion diffusion, and provide more electrochemical reactive sites. When metal compounds are introduced to filter into membranes together with graphene, metal compound particles will exist between the graphene sheets, which will support the previously stacked graphene sheets and increase the gap between the sheets, thus increasing the specific surface area and showing better electrochemical performance.",
                "In order to further observe the microstructure of the NiCoSex/CG film, a TEM test was carried out. In Fig. 2a and b, the whole rod is loaded onto the graphene surface. Zooming in even further, it can be observed that the NiCoSex rod wrapped by carbon nanotubes is 700 nm long and 250 nm wide, and shows a hollow structure, in which the metal selenide particles are tightly wrapped in the carbon layer. On the one hand, this wrapping and winding structure can construct an efficient conductive network and promote ion diffusion. On the other hand, selenide particles can be tightly anchored inside the carbon layer to prevent the deterioration of properties caused by shedding. In Fig. 2c, one-dimensional carbon nanotubes and amorphous graphene structures can be observed. Further magnifying the internal particles (Fig. 2d), the (210) crystal plane belonging to cobalt selenide and the (200) crystal plane belonging to nickel selenide can be obviously observed. Cobalt selenide and nickel selenide doped with each other, together to form a particle, indicating the successful synthesis of the cobalt–nickel heterojunction structure. The HAADF image (Fig. 2e) further confirmed the structural characteristics, and the element distribution images reflect the uniform distribution of C, Co, Ni, and Se elements in the whole rods.",
                "In order to explore the surface chemical states of the CoSe2/CG, NiSe2/CG and NiCoSex/CG films, XPS detection was performed on the three samples. In Fig. 3a, the spectra of C 1s of the three samples are all composed of C–C/CC, C–O and CO bonds, which are located at 284.8, 286.0, and 288.6 eV, respectively. In addition to the peak of the C–O bond at 533.1 eV, there are two more peaks near 530.5 and 531.5 eV in the O 1s spectra (Fig. 3b). The peak at ca. 530.5 eV is mainly from the surface oxidation of metal selenides. The peaks at positions 531.7 and 531.4 eV should belong to the C–O–Co and C–O–Ni bonds, reflecting the strong interfacial interaction on the interface between graphene and the metal. The chemical connection of the oxygen bridge bond, on the one hand, effectively anchors the metal selenides to the graphene surface, preventing them from falling off. On the other hand, the electron exchange between metal selenides and carbon materials can be enhanced, and the electrochemical reaction rate can be improved obviously. In the Co 2p spectra (Fig. 3c), there are three pairs of peaks at 780.9/797.0 eV, 783.6/801.2 eV, and 787.2/804.0 eV, which represent cobalt selenides, cobalt oxides and satellite peaks respectively. Similarly, in the Ni 2p spectra (Fig. 3d), there are three pairs of peaks at 856.2/873.9 eV, 858.5/876.8 eV, and 862.9/881.0 eV, representing nickel selenides, nickel oxides and satellite peaks respectively. The above discussion demonstrates the successful synthesis of the NiCoSex heterojunction structures and their adhesion to the graphene surface through strong interfacial interactions. In addition, due to the high surface activity of selenides, surface oxidation is inevitable.",
                "Then, we systematically evaluated the electrochemical performances of the synthesized CoSe2/CG, NiSe2/CG and NiCoSex/CG flexible electrodes as anode electrodes for SIBs to explore the effects of the designed heterojunction on the final electrochemical performance. Fig. 4a shows the measured CV curves of the NiCoSex/CG electrode. In the first cycle, due to the formation of the SEI film, there is a significant peak located at 1.3 V in the cathodic scanning, which disappears in the next two cycles. Peaks in the range of 1.2–0.5 V should correspond to the conversion reactions from CoSe2/NiSe2 to Co/Ni and Na2Se phases. In the anodic scanning, a series of peaks between 1.5 and 2.0 V should be corresponding to the multistep conversion reactions of Co/Ni and Na2Se to CoSe2/NiSe2. Except for the first cycle, the last two cycles are highly overlapping, indicating the high reversibility of the NiCoSex/CG electrodes.",
                "In addition, the first discharge capacity and first charge capacity of NiCoSex/CG at 0.1 A g−1 are 358 and 338 mA h g−1, respectively (Fig. 4b). The first coulombic efficiency of NiCoSex/CG is 94.4%, which is much higher than those of CoSe2/CG (83.7%) and NiSe2/CG (92.7%) (Fig. S3 and S4†). Moreover, the first coulombic efficiency of NiCoSex/CG at 0.5 and 1 A g−1 is 89.4% and 84.4% respectively, which is also a high first coulombic efficiency (Fig. S5†). The high first coulombic efficiency is due to the low irreversible capacity of the NiCoSex/CG electrode, indicating the excellent electrochemical reversibility and high rate sodiation of the heterojunction. On the one hand, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) fitting results (Fig. 4c, Table S1†) show that the Rf value of NiCoSex/CG (13.9 Ω) is much lower than those of CoSe2/CG (58.5 Ω) and NiSe2/CG (27.0 Ω), indicating that the consumption of sodium ions of NiCoSex/CG in the SEI film formation is low. On the other hand, the formation of the Ni–Co heterojunction can effectively promote electron exchange and ion diffusion, and reduce the production of dead sodium. It is found that the capacity retention rate of NiCoSex/CG (61.2%) after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 is obviously higher than those of CoSe2/CG (29.4%) and NiSe2/CG (33.3%), showing very good cycling stability (Fig. 4d). In addition, choosing the appropriate voltage window is also an effective means to improve the cycling stability. For transition metal selenides, researchers usually shorten the voltage window to 0.5–3.0 V, sacrifice part of the low voltage capacity of the negative electrode of the battery, and mitigate the volume change in the conversion reaction and the impact of side reactions, in order to achieve more stable cycle performance. In order to explore the influence of voltage window on electrochemical performance, we tested three groups of cyclic curves under different voltage windows (Fig. S6†), and the results showed that the wider the voltage window, the higher the reversible capacity, but the worse the cycling stability. Through comparative analysis, NiCoSex/CG can not only maintain a high reversible capacity, but also maintain a stable cycle performance in the voltage range of 0.5–2.9 V. Particularly, the NiCoSex/CG electrode shows remarkable reversible capacities of 338, 285, 225, 206, 183 and 140 mA h g−1 upon incrementally increasing the current density from 0.1 to 5.0 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 4e). When the current density reduces to 0.1 A g−1, the recovery capacity is 219 mA h g−1, showing better rate capability than the other two single-phase electrodes. Combined with the fitting results of EIS (Fig. 4c, Table S1†), it can be found that the Rct value of NiCoSex/CG (11.1 Ω) is much lower than those of CoSe2/CG (43.5 Ω) and NiSe2/CG (29.2 Ω), showing a very high ion diffusion rate. By comparison, it can be found that CoSe2/CG has a high reversible capacity, but the rate and cycle performances are poor. Although the reversible capacity of NiSe2/CG is not high, it has better rate and cycle performances. The heterojunction materials combine the high rate of nickel selenide and the high capacity of cobalt selenide to have a synergistic effect and show better comprehensive performance. After 2000 cycles at 2 A g−1, NiCoSex/CG can maintain a capacity up to 120 mA h g−1 (Fig. 4g), exhibiting remarkable long-periodic cycling stability at high current. In order to highlight the high properties of the NiCoSex/CG heterostructured electrodes, the electrodes were compared with the previously recorded flexible anodes for SIBs (Fig. 4f, Table S2†), and are superior to all the selected flexible anodes at long periods and high rates. Therefore, it can be concluded from these results that the NiCoSex/CG electrodes perform well in terms of stability and capacity reversibility superior to all single-phase materials.",
                "For the purpose of understanding the high-rate performance of NiCoSex/CG, CV tests of the three films were performed at incremental scanning rates to compare the electrochemical kinetics of the heterojunction materials with those of single-phase materials (Fig. 5a–c). With the increase of the scanning rate, there is a nonlinear relationship between the measured current (i) and the square root of scanning rate (v) at the corresponding potential, indicating that the electrochemical redox reaction is not a simple ion diffusion control process. The following equations describe the nonlinear relationship between i and v:",
                "where a and b are adjustable parameters, v is the scanning rate, and i is the peak current. The value of b represents the dominated behavior of sodium storage. When the value of b is close to 1, the electrochemical process is mainly controlled by the pseudocapacitive effect. When b is close to 0.5, ion diffusion controls most of the electrochemical processes. By taking logarithms of the scanning rate (v) and peak current (i) of the three samples, the linear relationship as shown in Fig. 5d–f is obtained. After fitting, the b values of CoSe2/CG at the potentials of 0.8 V and 2.0 V are 0.79 and 0.83, and the b values of NiSe2/CG at the potentials of 1.0 V and 1.7 V are 0.98 and 0.93. The b values of NiCoSex/CG at 1.4, 1.0, 1.7 and 1.8 V were 0.84, 0.81, 0.79 and 0.80, respectively. The pseudocapacitance effect controls the most electrochemical reactions of the heterojunction electrodes.",
                "For the purpose of understanding the electrochemical dynamics difference between heterojunction materials and single-phase materials, the percentage of capacitance contribution can be obtained by the following formula:",
                "where k1v represents the contribution of pseudocapacitance, and k2v1/2 represents the contribution of ion diffusion intercalation. It is calculated that when the scan rate increases from 0.1 to 2 mV s−1 (Fig. 5g–i), the pseudocapacitive contribution of NiSe2/CG is 83, 85, 88, 90, 92, and 95%, and that of the NiCoSex/CG is 79, 84, 87, 90, 93, and 96%, which are much higher than those of CoSe2/CG (72, 75, 78, 80, 85, and 92%). Moreover, the GITT technique (Fig. 5j and k) shows that the ionic diffusion coefficient (DNa+) of NiCoSex/CG is significantly higher than the ionic diffusion coefficients of CoSe2/CG and NiSe2/CG during the insertion/extraction of the sodium ion. Compared with that of the single-phase electrode, the co-electrode diffusion coefficient of the cobalt–nickel heterojunction is larger (Fig. 5l). It is concluded that the high contribution rate of pseudocapacitance and the fast ion diffusion coefficient are the key factors for the high-rate performance of the NiCoSex/CG heterojunction electrode. To further verify the practicability of the flexible heterojunction electrode, a flexible full-pack battery was assembled with the NiCoSex/CG film as the anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 as the cathode (Fig. 6). At a current density of 100 mA g−1, the full-cell exhibits a reversible capacity of 265 mA h g−1, and remains at 160 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. Meanwhile, the soft-pack battery can successfully light a thermometer under flat, folded 90°, folded 180° and curled conditions, showing excellent flexibility and output stability."

Furthermore, the assembled flexible full battery exhibits excellent flexibility and output stability. We conclude that the design of the heterojunction structure of selenide and the construction of an oxygen bridge can promote the stability of the structure and enhance the ion and electron diffusion dynamics. On the other hand, there are more electrochemically active sites on the heterojunction surface, which can adsorb more sodium ions. Our research provides new horizons for the structural design of other materials, which will benefit the design of flexible batteries for large-scale application."
